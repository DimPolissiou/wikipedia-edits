Penn's periodical \"The Alumni Register,\" published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group that had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the \"New Building\" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence \"Unnamed Charity School\" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235939/http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php |date=2012-10-20 }}  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }} Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> \n|Nonsectarian,<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: \"The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }}.

The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labeled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodism|Methodist]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473\u2013475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208022301/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |archive-date=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|Princeton University\n|1746 as ''College of New Jersey''\n|Nonsectarian,<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\"/> founded by Calvinist [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/english/Stop05.htm|title=University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>\n|-\n|Columbia University\n|1754 as ''King's College''\n|Church of England\n|-\n|Brown University\n|1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''\n|[[Baptist]], founding charter promises \"no religious tests\" and \"full liberty of conscience\"<ref>Brown's website characterizes it as \"the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia,\" but adds that at the time it was \"the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions.\"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Brown's charter stated that \"into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.\" The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be \"five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians.\"{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Providence |volume=22 |page=511}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dartmouth College\n|1769\n|Calvinist (Congregationalist)\n|-\n|Cornell University\n|1865\n|Nonsectarian\n|}\n\n:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.

In 1899, Penn's board of trustees formally adopted a third founding date of 1740, in response to a petition from Penn's General Alumni Society.  Penn was chartered in 1755, the same year collegiate classes began.  \"Religious affiliation\" refers to financial sponsorship, formal association with, and promotion by, a religious denomination.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\n\nA common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members. The ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' helped to perpetuate this belief. The supposed \"IV League\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the \"IV League\" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the \"IV League\" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718192438/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |archive-date=2010-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Ivy League===\n[[File:Chancellor Green exterior Princeton.JPG|thumb|Chancellor Green Library at Princeton, 2007]]\n[[File:Brown university robinson hall 2009a.JPG|thumb|Robinson Hall at Brown, 2009]]\n[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cornell baseball player, 1908]]\n\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of the [[College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].\n\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California at Berkeley are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archivedate=2010-09-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \"full liberty of conscience\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\n\n\"Ivy League\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first=Joseph | last=Epstein | year=2003 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-34073-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/snobbery00jose }} p. 55, \"by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them.\"</ref> Novels<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | url = https://archive.org/details/eastsidestorynov00auch_0 }} p. 179, \"he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 \"''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption. ...

They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>\n\n===History of the athletic league===\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|Yale University's four-oared crew team, posing with the 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy.]]\n[[File:The 1879 Brown University Baseball Team.jpg|thumb|The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with [[William Edward White|W.E.

The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870\u20131894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\n\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\n\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\n\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = 2014-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = 2014-10-10 | url-status=dead | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\n\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\". The earliest reference to the \"Ivy colleges\" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/>  In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\n\n{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called \"Ivy League\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\n\n{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years\u2014and markedly in the last three months\u2014there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\n\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \"Ivy League\".

Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].\nThe proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Post-World War II====\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Tuck School of Business.JPG|thumb|Students in Stell Hall at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], 2007]]\n[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]\n\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\n\n{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships.

This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season. A year later, the Ivy League absorbed the EIBL. The Ivy League claims the EIBL's history as its own.

Before they became coeducational, many of the Ivy schools maintained extensive social ties with nearby [[Seven Sisters (colleges)|Seven Sisters]] [[women's college]]s, including weekend visits, dances and parties inviting Ivy and Seven Sisters students to mingle.

Penn's periodical \"The Alumni Register,\" published by the General Alumni Society, then began a grassroots campaign to retroactively revise the university's founding date to 1740, in order to appear older than [[Princeton University]], which had been chartered in 1746.  In 1899, the Board of Trustees acceded to the alumni initiative and voted to change the founding date to 1740.  The rationale offered in 1899 was that, in 1750, founder Benjamin Franklin and his original board of trustees purchased a completed but unused building and assumed an unnamed trust from a group that had hoped to begin a church and charity school in Philadelphia.  This edifice was commonly called the \"New Building\" by local citizens and was referred to by such name in Franklin's memoirs as well as the legal bill of sale in Penn's archives.  No name is stated or known for the associated educational trust, hence \"Unnamed Charity School\" serves as a placeholder to refer to the trust which is the premise for Penn's association with a founding date of 1740.  The first named entity in Penn's early history was the 1751 secondary school for boys and charity school for indigent children called \"Academy and Charitable School in the Province of Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235939/http://www.upenn.edu/about/heritage.php |date=2012-10-20 }}  Undergraduate education began in 1755 and the organization then changed its name to \"College, Academy and Charity School of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }} Operation of the charity school was discontinued a few years later.</ref> \n|Nonsectarian,<ref>Penn's website, like other sources, makes an important point of Penn's heritage being nonsectarian, associated with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and the Academy of Philadelphia's nonsectarian board of trustees: \"The goal of Franklin's nonsectarian, practical plan would be the education of a business and governing class rather than of clergymen.\"[http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428155156/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/1700s/penn1700s.html |date=2006-04-28 }}.

The school was to have operated inside a church supported by the same group of adherents.  But the organizers ran short of financing and, although the frame of the building was raised, the interior was left unfinished.  The founders of the Academy of Philadelphia purchased the unused building in 1750 for their new venture and, in the process, assumed the original trust.  Since 1899, Penn has claimed a founding date of 1740, based on the organizational date of the charity school and the premise that it had institutional identity with the Academy of Philadelphia. Whitefield was a firebrand Methodist associated with [[Great Awakening|The Great Awakening]]; since the Methodists did not formally break from the Church of England until 1784, Whitefield in 1740 would be labeled [[Church of England|Episcopalian]], and in fact ''Brown'' University, emphasizing its own pioneering nonsectarianism, refers to Penn's origin as \"Episcopalian\".[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Penn is sometimes assumed to have Quaker ties (its athletic teams are called \"Quakers,\" and the cross-registration alliance between Penn, Haverford, Swarthmore and Bryn Mawr is known as the \"Quaker Consortium.\") But Penn's website does not assert any formal affiliation with Quakerism, historic or otherwise, and [[Haverford College]] implicitly asserts a non-Quaker origin for Penn when it states that \"Founded in 1833, Haverford is the oldest institution of higher learning with Quaker roots in North America.\"{{cite web |url=http://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054925/https://www.haverford.edu/publicrelations/news/QandA.html |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}</ref> founded by [[Church of England]]/[[Methodism|Methodist]] members<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Protestant Episcopal Church |volume=22 |pages=473\u2013475 |first=Daniel Dulany |last=Addison }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |title=Brown Admission: Our History |publisher=Brown.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208022301/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |archive-date=2011-02-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n|-\n|Princeton University\n|1746 as ''College of New Jersey''\n|Nonsectarian,<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\"/> founded by Calvinist [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]<ref name=\"princetonchapeltour\">{{cite web|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~oktour/virtualtour/english/Stop05.htm|title=University Chapel: Orange Key Virtual Tour of Princeton University|publisher=Princeton University}}</ref>\n|-\n|Columbia University\n|1754 as ''King's College''\n|Church of England\n|-\n|Brown University\n|1764 as the ''College in the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations''\n|[[Baptist]], founding charter promises \"no religious tests\" and \"full liberty of conscience\"<ref>Brown's website characterizes it as \"the Baptist answer to Congregationalist Yale and Harvard; Presbyterian Princeton; and Episcopalian Penn and Columbia,\" but adds that at the time it was \"the only one that welcomed students of all religious persuasions.\"[https://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118080913/http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Admission/gettoknowus/ourhistory.html |date=2012-01-18 }} Brown's charter stated that \"into this liberal and catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious tests, but on the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.\" The charter called for twenty-two of the thirty-six trustees to be Baptists, but required that the remainder be \"five Friends, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians.\"{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Providence |volume=22 |page=511}}</ref>\n|-\n|Dartmouth College\n|1769\n|Calvinist (Congregationalist)\n|-\n|Cornell University\n|1865\n|Nonsectarian\n|}\n\n:<small>'''Note:''' Six of the eight Ivy League universities consider their founding dates to be simply the date that they received their charters and thus became legal corporations with the authority to grant academic degrees.

These schools were known for their long-standing traditions in intercollegiate athletics, often being the first schools to participate in such activities. However, at this time, none of these institutions made efforts to form an athletic league.\n\nA common [[folk etymology]] attributes the name to the Roman numeral for four (IV), asserting that there was such a sports league originally with four members.

The supposed \"IV League\" was formed over a century ago and consisted of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and a fourth school that varies depending on who is telling the story.<ref>The [[Chicago Public Library]] reports the \"IV League\" explanation, [http://www.chipublib.org/008subject/005genre/faqiv.html] sourced only from the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins''. {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>Various ''Ask Ezra'' student columns report the \"IV League\" explanation, apparently relying on the ''Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins'' as the sole source: [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=895550400#question13] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=798955200#question9] [http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=639892800#question5]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |title=The Penn Current / October 17, 2002 / Ask Benny |publisher=Upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606232308/http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/2002/101702/askbenny.html |archivedate=June 6, 2010 |df= }}</ref> However, it is clear that [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Yale University|Yale]] and [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia]] met on November 23, 1876 at the so-called Massasoit Convention to decide on uniform rules for the emerging game of American football, which rapidly spread.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |title=This according to the Penn history of varsity football |publisher=Archives.upenn.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718192438/http://www.archives.upenn.edu/histy/features/sports/football/1800s/origins.html |archive-date=2010-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Ivy League===\n[[File:Chancellor Green exterior Princeton.JPG|thumb|Chancellor Green Library at Princeton, 2007]]\n[[File:Brown university robinson hall 2009a.JPG|thumb|Robinson Hall at Brown, 2009]]\n[[File:Cornell Baseball2.jpg|thumb|upright|Cornell baseball player, 1908]]\n\nSeven out of the eight Ivy League schools were founded before the [[American Revolution]]; Cornell was founded just after the [[American Civil War]]. These seven were the primary colleges in the Northern and Middle Colonies, and their early faculties and founding boards were largely drawn from other Ivy League institutions. There were also some British graduates from the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of St. Andrews]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and elsewhere on their boards. Similarly, the founder of the [[College of William & Mary]], in 1693, was a British graduate of the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the University of Edinburgh. Cornell provided [[Stanford University]] with its [[David Starr Jordan|first president]].\n\nThe influence of these institutions on the founding of other colleges and universities is notable. This included the Southern public college movement which blossomed in the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century when Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia established what became the flagship universities for each of these states. In 1801, a majority of the first board of trustees for what became the [[University of South Carolina]] were Princeton alumni. They appointed [[Jonathan Maxcy]], a Brown graduate, as the university's first president. [[Thomas Cooper (American politician, born 1759)|Thomas Cooper]], an Oxford alumnus and University of Pennsylvania faculty member, became the second president of the South Carolina college. The founders of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] came from Yale, hence the school colors of University of California at Berkeley are [[Yale Blue]] and California Gold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |title=Resource: Student history |publisher=Resource.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2011-01-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909165637/http://resource.berkeley.edu/r_html/r01_04.html |archivedate=2010-09-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome of the Ivy League schools have identifiable [[Protestant]] roots, while others were founded as non-sectarian schools. [[Church of England]] ''King's College'' broke up during the Revolution and was reformed as public nonsectarian [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]]. In the early nineteenth century, the specific purpose of training Calvinist ministers was handed off to theological seminaries, but a denominational tone and such relics as compulsory chapel often lasted well into the twentieth century. Penn and Brown were officially founded as nonsectarian schools. Brown's charter promised no religious tests and \"full liberty of conscience\", but placed control in the hands of a board of twenty-two Baptists, five Quakers, four Congregationalists, and five Episcopalians. Cornell has been strongly nonsectarian from its founding.\n\n\"Ivy League\" is sometimes used as a way of referring to an [[elite]] [[Social class|class]], even though institutions such as Cornell University were among the first in the United States to reject racial and gender discrimination in their admissions policies. This dates back to at least 1935.<ref>{{cite book | title=Snobbery: The American Version | first=Joseph | last=Epstein | year=2003 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=0-618-34073-4 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/snobbery00jose }} p. 55, \"by WASP Baltzell meant something much more specific; he intended to cover a select group of people who passed through a congeries of elite American institutions: certain eastern [[University-preparatory school|prep schools]], the Ivy League colleges, and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] among them.\"</ref> Novels<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book | first = Louis | last = Auchincloss | title = East Side Story | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-618-45244-3 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | url = https://archive.org/details/eastsidestorynov00auch_0 }} p. 179, \"he dreaded the aridity of snobbery which he knew infected the Ivy League colleges\"</ref> and memoirs<ref>{{cite book | title = Project Girl | first = Janet |last = McDonald | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2000|isbn = 0-520-22345-4}} p. 163 \"''Newsweek'' is a morass of incest, nepotism, elitism, racism and utter classic white male patriarchal corruption. ...

They had always had distinguished faculties; some of the first Americans with [[doctorate]]s had taught for them; but they now decided that they could not both be world-class research institutions and be competitive in the highest ranks of American college sport; in addition, the schools experienced the scandals of any other big-time football programs, although more quietly.<ref>scandals: James Axtell, ''The Making of Princeton University'' (2006), p.274; quoting a former executive director of the Ivy League</ref>\n\n===History of the athletic league===\n[[File:Yale's four-oared crew team with 1876 Centennial Regatta trophy.jpg|thumb|Yale University's four-oared crew team, posing with the 1876 Centennial [[Regatta]] trophy.]]\n[[File:The 1879 Brown University Baseball Team.jpg|thumb|The 1879 Brown baseball varsity, with [[William Edward White|W.E.

The RAAC hosted a de facto national championship in rowing during the period 1870\u20131894. In 1895, Cornell, Columbia, and Penn founded the [[Intercollegiate Rowing Association]], which remains the oldest collegiate athletic organizing body in the US. To this day, the IRA Championship Regatta determines the national champion in rowing and all of the Ivies are regularly invited to compete.\n\nA basketball league was later created in 1902, when Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and Princeton formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League]]; they were later joined by Penn and Dartmouth.\n\nIn 1906, the organization that eventually became the [[NCAA|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] was formed, primarily to formalize rules for the emerging sport of football. But of the 39 original member colleges in the NCAA, only two of them (Dartmouth and Penn) later became Ivies.\n\nIn February 1903, intercollegiate wrestling began when Yale accepted a challenge from Columbia, published in the Yale News. The dual meet took place prior to a basketball game hosted by Columbia and resulted in a tie. Two years later, Penn and Princeton also added wrestling teams, leading to the formation of the student-run Intercollegiate Wrestling Association, now the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling Association]] (EIWA), the first and oldest collegiate wrestling league in the US.<ref>{{cite news | title = Columbia Celebrates College Wrestling Centennial | publisher = Columbia College Today | url = http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | access-date = 2014-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010054526/http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/may03/features5.php | archive-date = 2014-10-10 | url-status=dead | df =  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Penn, Princeton and Yale formed the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Baseball League]]; they were later joined by Harvard, Brown, Army and Navy.\n\nBefore the formal establishment of the Ivy League, there was an \"unwritten and unspoken agreement among certain Eastern colleges on athletic relations\". The earliest reference to the \"Ivy colleges\" came in 1933, when [[Stanley Woodward]] of the [[New York Herald Tribune]] used it to refer to the eight current members plus Army.<ref name=officialhistory/>  In 1935, the [[Associated Press]] reported on an example of collaboration between the schools:\n\n{{quote|The athletic authorities of the so-called \"Ivy League\" are considering drastic measures to curb the increasing tendency toward riotous attacks on goal posts and other encroachments by spectators on playing fields.|The Associated Press|''The New York Times''<ref>{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = Colleges Searching for Check On Trend to Goal Post Riots | work = The New York Times | page = 33 | date = 1935-12-06 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1935/12/06/archives/colleges-searching-for-check-on-trend-to-goal-post-riots-eastern.html}}</ref>}}\n\nDespite such collaboration, the universities did not seem to consider the formation of the league as imminent. [[Romeyn Berry]], Cornell's manager of athletics, reported the situation in January 1936 as follows:\n\n{{quote|text=I can say with certainty that in the last five years\u2014and markedly in the last three months\u2014there has been a strong drift among the eight or ten universities of the East which see a good deal of one another in sport toward a closer bond of confidence and cooperation and toward the formation of a common front against the threat of a breakdown in the ideals of amateur sport in the interests of supposed expediency.\n\nPlease do not regard that statement as implying the organization of an Eastern conference or even a poetic \"Ivy League\".

Harvard's team, \"The Oneida\", won the race and was presented with trophy black walnut oars from then-presidential nominee General [[Franklin Pierce]].\nThe proposal did not succeed\u2014on January 11, 1937, the athletic authorities at the schools rejected the \"possibility of a heptagonal league in football such as these institutions maintain in basketball, baseball and track.\" However, they noted that the league \"has such promising possibilities that it may not be dismissed and must be the subject of further consideration.\"<ref>{{cite news | title = Plea for an Ivy Football League Rejected by College Authorities | work = The New York Times | page = 26 | date = 1937-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Post-World War II====\n[[File:Dartmouth College campus 2007-11-06 Tuck School of Business.JPG|thumb|Students in Stell Hall at Dartmouth's [[Tuck School of Business]], 2007]]\n[[File:Scroll and Key 1866 delegation Yale College.jpg|thumb|Students of Yale College, 1866]]\n\nIn 1945 the presidents of the eight schools signed the first ''Ivy Group Agreement'', which set academic, financial, and athletic standards for the [[American football|football]] teams. The principles established reiterated those put forward in the Harvard-Yale-Princeton Presidents' Agreement of 1916. The Ivy Group Agreement established the core tenet that an applicant's ability to play on a team would not influence admissions decisions:\n\n{{quote|The members of the Group reaffirm their prohibition of athletic scholarships.

This is generally reckoned as the formal formation of the Ivy League. As part of the transition, Brown, the only Ivy that hadn't joined the EIBL, did so for the 1954\u201355 season.

It was released in 1978 on [[Epic Records]]. The album would eventually sell over four million copies worldwide, two million in America during its initial run and another two million worldwide.<ref>Chery, Carl: ''XXL: Michael Jackson Special Collectors Edition'', page 100. American Press.</ref> The album marked the first time in the band's career in which they had complete artistic control, and was also the first album produced by the brothers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Overview===\nThe band had left their longtime label [[Motown Records|Motown]] in 1975 with the exception of brother [[Jermaine Jackson]] who had stayed with Motown after he married [[Berry Gordy]]'s daughter, Hazel Gordy. After a couple of years of being with [[Philadelphia International Records|Philly International]], the Jacksons set their sights on one of Columbia Records' most popular labels, [[Epic Records|Epic]]. After having their previous albums spearheaded by legendary producers [[Kenny Gamble]] and [[Leon Huff]], Epic allowed the Jackson brothers to write and produce their own material for the first time in their career, something that Motown did not permit. Composing much of the album in their home-made recording studio in their gated Hayvenhurst mansion, the group finished recording the album within two months.  \n\nThis album was the first album to include songs written by the Jackson themselves.  Every song was credited to the Jacksons  as a band or individually to Michael and Randy, with the exception of the lead single, \"[[Blame It on the Boogie]].\" That song was written (somewhat confusingly)  by a British singer-songwriter named [[Mick Jackson (singer)|Michael \"Mick\" Jackson]], who was no relation to the members of the Jacksons.  \n\nLike many of the acts that had left Motown, the Jacksons had to accept the possibility that they would no longer enjoy the same level of success they had while they were associated with the label\u2014something Motown themselves reiterated upon hearing that longtime front man [[Michael Jackson]] had moved on to [[Off the Wall|a full-fledged solo career]] following ''Destiny'''s release.\n\n===Release and reaction===\nReleased on December 17, 1978, ''Destiny'' re-established them as a top-selling group. The single, \"[[Blame It on the Boogie]]\", was released in October 1978 (UK No. 8) as the advance single from the album. Although \"Blame It on the Boogie\" returned the Jacksons to the Hot 100 it was not the single to affect a major comeback for the Jacksons peaking at No. 54; However, \"Blame It on the Boogie\" did reach No. 3 R&B and would be coupled with \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" on an extended club play single which would reach No. 20 on the dance charts in 1979.\n\nThe album's success was largely based on the second single released from the album, \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\", which became a [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 10]] single in the spring of 1979. The album eventually peaked at number eleven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums chart]] and number three on the ''Billboard'' Black Albums chart and went on to [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] status-cementing it as the first [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified platinum seller by the Jacksons as most of their Motown recordings were uncertifiable despite their huge success on the charts, and over two million copies worldwide. The accompanying tour was a huge success running on many legs and also toured overseas.\n\n===Album cover===\nThe album's artwork, painted by Gary Meyer, has [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]] and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] on top of the word \"DESTINY\" (the album's title) carved in [[stone]] during a [[thunderstorm]] containing a [[whirlwind]] and stormy waters splashing against the \"DESTINY\" monolith. A [[peacock]] is shown on the back cover fanning his tail and has a message provided by Michael and Jackie for Peacock Productions: \"Through the ages, the peacock has been honored and praised for its attractive, illustrious beauty. Of all the bird family, the peacock is the only bird that integrates all colors into one, and displays this radiance of fire only when in love. We, like the peacock, try to integrate all races into one through the love of music.\"\n\n==Re-release==\nIn honor of its 30th anniversary, ''Destiny'', including two bonus tracks of rare 12-inch disco mixes previously unavailable on CD, was released on January 27, 2009, on Epic/Legacy, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. Both unreleased tracks were mixed by John Luongo.<ref>[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 LegacyRecordings.com \u00bb News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044158/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 |date=2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1  = [[Blame It on the Boogie]]\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Mick Jackson (singer)|Mick Jackson]]|David Jackson|Elmar Krohn}}\n| length1 = 3:36\n| title2  = Push Me Away\n| writer2 = [[The Jacksons]]\n| length2 = 4:19\n| title3  = Things I Do for You\n| writer3 = The Jacksons\n| length3 = 4:05\n| title4  = [[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\n| writer4 = {{hlist|[[Michael Jackson]]|[[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]]}}\n| length4 = 8:00\n| title5  = Destiny\n| writer5 = The Jacksons\n| length5 = 4:55\n| title6  = Bless His Soul\n| writer6 = The Jacksons\n| length6 = 4:57\n| title7  = All Night Dancin'\n| writer7 = {{hlist|Michael Jackson|Randy Jackson}}\n| length7 = 6:11\n| title8  = That's What You Get (For Being Polite)\n| writer8 = {{hlist|Michael Jackson|Randy Jackson}}\n| length8 = 4:57\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = 2009 re-edition bonus tracks\n| title9  = [[Blame It on the Boogie]] \n| note9   = John Luongo Disco Mix\n| length9 = 6:59\n| title10  = [[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]] \n| note10   = John Luongo Disco Mix\n| length10 = 8:38\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n===The Jacksons===\n* [[Michael Jackson]] &ndash; lead vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Jackie Jackson]] &ndash; lead vocals (track 6), backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Marlon Jackson]] &ndash; backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Tito Jackson]] &ndash; guitars, backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]] &ndash; congas (3, 5-8), vocal arrangements, percussion (3), backing vocals\n\n===Additional personnel===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Roland Bautista]] &ndash; guitar (1, 2)\n* [[Paul Jackson, Jr.]] &ndash; guitar (3, 5, 7, 8), guitar solo (6)\n* [[Michael Sembello]] &ndash; guitar (1, 2, 5-8), bass (2)\n* [[Michael Boddicker]] &ndash; synthesizers (4)\n* [[Greg Phillinganes]] &ndash; keyboards, synthesizers (4, 8), rhythm arrangements\n* [[Gary King (bass player)|Gary King]] &ndash; bass (1)\n* [[Nathan Watts]] &ndash; bass (1, 3, 5-8)\n* [[Ed Greene]] &ndash; drums (4-8)\n* [[Ricky Lawson]] &ndash; drums (3)\n* [[Rick Marotta]] &ndash; drums (1, 2), percussion (1)\n* [[Paulinho da Costa]] &ndash; percussion (3, 4)\n* [[Laudir de Oliveira]] &ndash; congas (1)\n* Claudio Slon &ndash; congas (1)\n\n===Production===\n* Produced by [[The Jacksons]]\n* Executive producers: [[Bobby Colomby]], Mike Atkinson\n* Engineers: Don Murray, Peter Granet\n* [[Clare Fischer]]: string arrangement (2)\n* Tom Tom 84: horn arrangements (3-8), string arrangements (4-6, 8)\n* Graphic coordinator: Tony Lane\n* Cover artwork by Gary Meyer\n* Photography by Jeffrey Scales\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It was released in 1978 on [[Epic Records]]. The album would eventually sell over four million copies worldwide, two million in America during its initial run and another two million worldwide.<ref>Chery, Carl: ''XXL: Michael Jackson Special Collectors Edition'', page 100. American Press.</ref> The album marked the first time in the band's career in which they had complete artistic control, and was also the first album produced by the brothers.\n\n==History==\n\n===Overview===\nThe band had left their longtime label [[Motown Records|Motown]] in 1975 with the exception of brother [[Jermaine Jackson]] who had stayed with Motown after he married [[Berry Gordy]]'s daughter, Hazel Gordy. After a couple of years of being with [[Philadelphia International Records|Philly International]], the Jacksons set their sights on one of Columbia Records' most popular labels, [[Epic Records|Epic]]. After having their previous albums spearheaded by legendary producers [[Kenny Gamble]] and [[Leon Huff]], Epic allowed the Jackson brothers to write and produce their own materialfor the first time in their career, something that Motown did not permit. Composing much of the album in their home-made recording studio in their gated Hayvenhurst mansion, the group finished recording the album within two months.  \n\nThis album was the first album to include songs written by the Jackson themselves.  Every song was credited to the Jacksons  as a band or individually to Michael and Randy, with the exception of the lead single, \"[[Blame It on the Boogie]].\" That song was written (somewhat confusingly)  by a British singer-songwriter named [[Mick Jackson (singer)|Michael \"Mick\" Jackson]], who was no relation to the members of the Jacksons.  \n\nLike many of the acts that had left Motown, the Jacksons had to accept the possibility that they would no longer enjoy the same level of success they had while they were associated with the label\u2014something Motown themselves reiterated upon hearing that longtime front man [[Michael Jackson]] had moved on to [[Off the Wall|a full-fledged solo career]] following ''Destiny'''s release.\n\n===Release and reaction===\nReleased on December 17, 1978, ''Destiny'' re-established them as a top-selling group. The single, \"[[Blame It on the Boogie]]\", was released in October 1978 (UK No. 8) as the advance single from the album. Although \"Blame It on the Boogie\" returned the Jacksons to the Hot 100 it was not the single to affect a major comeback for the Jacksons peaking at No. 54; However, \"Blame It on the Boogie\" did reach No. 3 R&B and would be coupled with \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\" on an extended club play single which would reach No. 20 on the dance charts in 1979.\n\nThe album's success was largely based on the second single released from the album, \"[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\", which became a [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 10]] single in the spring of 1979. The album eventually peaked at number eleven on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Pop Albums chart]] and number three on the ''Billboard'' Black Albums chart and went on to [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] status-cementing it as the first [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified platinum seller by the Jacksons as most of their Motown recordings were uncertifiable despite their huge success on the charts, and over two million copies worldwide. The accompanying tour was a huge success running on many legs and also toured overseas.\n\n===Album cover===\nThe album's artwork, painted by Gary Meyer, has [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Michael Jackson|Michael]], [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]] and [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]] on top of the word \"DESTINY\" (the album's title) carved in [[stone]] during a [[thunderstorm]] containing a [[whirlwind]] and stormy waters splashing against the \"DESTINY\" monolith. A [[peacock]] is shown on the back cover fanning his tail and has a message provided by Michael and Jackie for Peacock Productions: \"Through the ages, the peacock has been honored and praised for its attractive, illustrious beauty. Of all the bird family, the peacock is the only bird that integrates all colors into one, and displays this radiance of fire only when in love. We, like the peacock, try to integrate all races into one through the love of music.\"\n\n==Re-release==\nIn honor of its 30th anniversary, ''Destiny'', including two bonus tracks of rare 12-inch disco mixes previously unavailable on CD, was released on January 27, 2009, on Epic/Legacy, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. Both unreleased tracks were mixed by John Luongo.<ref>[http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 LegacyRecordings.com \u00bb News<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709044158/http://www.legacyrecordings.com/News/NewsDetail.aspx?NewsGuid=aae9d0f4-0059-485b-8f27-bdac65e1e236 |date=2008-07-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| title1  = [[Blame It on the Boogie]]\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Mick Jackson (singer)|Mick Jackson]]|David Jackson|Elmar Krohn}}\n| length1 = 3:36\n| title2  = Push Me Away\n| writer2 = [[The Jacksons]]\n| length2 = 4:19\n| title3  = Things I Do for You\n| writer3 = The Jacksons\n| length3 = 4:05\n| title4  = [[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]\n| writer4 = {{hlist|[[Michael Jackson]]|[[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]]}}\n| length4 = 8:00\n| title5  = Destiny\n| writer5 = The Jacksons\n| length5 = 4:55\n| title6  = Bless His Soul\n| writer6 = The Jacksons\n| length6 = 4:57\n| title7  = All Night Dancin'\n| writer7 = {{hlist|Michael Jackson|Randy Jackson}}\n| length7 = 6:11\n| title8  = That's What You Get (For Being Polite)\n| writer8 = {{hlist|Michael Jackson|Randy Jackson}}\n| length8 = 4:57\n}}\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed = yes\n| headline = 2009 re-edition bonus tracks\n| title9  = [[Blame It on the Boogie]] \n| note9   = John Luongo Disco Mix\n| length9 = 6:59\n| title10  = [[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]] \n| note10   = John Luongo Disco Mix\n| length10 = 8:38\n}}\n\n==Personnel==\n===The Jacksons===\n* [[Michael Jackson]] &ndash; lead vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Jackie Jackson]] &ndash; lead vocals (track 6), backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Marlon Jackson]] &ndash; backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Tito Jackson]] &ndash; guitars, backing vocals, vocal arrangements\n* [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy Jackson]] &ndash; congas (3, 5-8), vocal arrangements, percussion (3), backing vocals\n\n===Additional personnel===\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Roland Bautista]] &ndash; guitar (1, 2)\n* [[Paul Jackson, Jr.]] &ndash; guitar (3, 5, 7, 8), guitar solo (6)\n* [[Michael Sembello]] &ndash; guitar (1, 2, 5-8), bass (2)\n* [[Michael Boddicker]] &ndash; synthesizers (4)\n* [[Greg Phillinganes]] &ndash; keyboards, synthesizers (4, 8), rhythm arrangements\n* [[Gary King (bass player)|Gary King]] &ndash; bass (1)\n* [[Nathan Watts]] &ndash; bass (1, 3, 5-8)\n* [[Ed Greene]] &ndash; drums (4-8)\n* [[Ricky Lawson]] &ndash; drums (3)\n* [[Rick Marotta]] &ndash; drums (1, 2), percussion (1)\n* [[Paulinho da Costa]] &ndash; percussion (3, 4)\n* [[Laudir de Oliveira]] &ndash; congas (1)\n* Claudio Slon &ndash; congas (1)\n\n===Production===\n* Produced by [[The Jacksons]]\n* Executive producers: [[Bobby Colomby]], Mike Atkinson\n* Engineers: Don Murray, Peter Granet\n* [[Clare Fischer]]: string arrangement (2)\n* Tom Tom 84: horn arrangements (3-8), string arrangements (4-6, 8)\n* Graphic coordinator: Tony Lane\n* Cover artwork by Gary Meyer\n* Photography by Jeffrey Scales\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Prior to the adoption of the [[Pachrang]] (five coloured) flag by Raja [[Man Singh I of Amber]], the original flag of the Kachwahas was known as the \"[[Jharshahi]] (tree-marked) flag\".]]\n\nThe '''Kachwaha''' is sub caste of the [[Kushwaha]] caste in India. Traditionally they were peasants involved in agriculture but in the 20th century they began to make claims of being a [[Rajput]] clan. Some families within the caste did rule a number of kingdoms and [[princely state]]s, such as [[Alwar State|Alwar]], [[Jaipur State|Amber]] (later called Jaipur) and [[Maihar]].\n\nThe Kachwaha are sometimes referred to as [[Kushwaha]]. This [[umbrella term]] is used to represent at least four communities with similar occupational backgrounds, all of whom claim descent from the mythological [[Suryavansh]] (Solar) dynasty via [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], who was one of the twin sons of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]]. Previously, they had worshipped [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]].\n\n==Origins== \nThe modern-day Kushwaha community, of which the Kachwaha form a part, generally claim descent from Kusha, a son of the mythological [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], Rama. This enables their claim to be of the Suryavansh dynasty but it is a myth of origin developed in the twentieth century. Prior to that time, the various branches that form the Kushwaha community -&nbsp;the Kachwahas, [[Kachhi (caste)|Kachhi]]s, [[Koeri]]s, and [[Murao]]s&nbsp;- favoured a connection with [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]].<ref name=Pinch1996pp91-92>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/12 12], 91\u201392 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nGanga Prasad Gupta claimed in the 1920s that Kushwah families worshiped [[Hanuman]]&nbsp;- described by Pinch as \"the embodiment of true devotion to Ram and Sita\"&nbsp;- during [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], a month in the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunar calendar]].<ref name=Pinch1996p98>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/98 98] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\nA Kachwaha family ruled at Amber, which later became known as the [[Jaipur State]], and this branch is sometimes referred to as being Rajput. They were chiefs at Amber and in 1561.  The chief, [[Bharmal|Bharamail Kachwaha]], was formally recognised as a [[Raja]]. A governor was appointed to oversee Bharamail's territory and a [[tribute]] arrangement saw Bharamail given a salaried rank, paid for from a share of the area's revenue.\nHistorians state that the Kacchapaghatas, like the Chandellas and Paramaras, originated as tributaries of the preceding powers of the region. They point out that it was only following the downfall, during the 8th\u201310th centuries AD, of Kannauj (regional seat of power following the breakup of Harsha's empire), that the Kacchapaghata state emerged as a principal power in the Chambal valley of present-day Madhya Pradesh. This view is largely supported by archaeological artifacts: Kacchapaghata coinage (minted Gupta-fashion) discovered in Madhya Pradesh and Gopaksetra inscriptions.\n\nAccording to Rudolf Hoernle (1905), the Kachhwahas are related to the Gurjara-Pratiharas. He identifies similarities between the names of the line of rulers of Kannauj (mid-10th century) with the recorded line of eight Kachwaha rulers of Gwalior (based on the Sas-Bahu inscription of Mahipal).\n\nAfter Sumitra, Madhubramh, Kanh, Devanik and Isha Singh ruled Narwar. The Sas-Bahu inscription dates to 1093, and provides a genealogy of the ruling family up to Mahipal (who died sometime before 1104).\n<ref>{{cite book |title=Raja Nal and the Goddess: The North Indian Epic Dhola in Performance |first=Susan Snow |last=Wadley |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780253217240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbsgVL4AGkoC&pg=PA110 |pages=110-111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Dancing Girl: A History of Early India |first=Balaji |last=Sadasivan |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2011 |isbn=9789814311670 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=980SAvbmpUkC&pg=PT255 |pages=233-234}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nThe Kushwaha were traditionally a peasant community and considered to be of the stigmatised [[Shudra]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/81 81] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Pinch describes them as \"skilled agriculturalists\".<ref name=Pinch1996p92>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/92 92] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> The traditional perception of Shudra status was increasingly challenged during the later decades of [[British Raj]] rule, although various castes had made claims of a higher status well before the British administration instituted its first census.{{efn|William Pinch records that, \"...&nbsp;a popular concern with status predated the rise of an imperial census apparatus and the colonial obsession with caste.&nbsp;...

Traditionally they were peasants involved in agriculture but in the 20th century they began to make claims of being a [[Rajput]] clan. Some families within the caste did rule a number of kingdoms and [[princely state]]s, such as [[Alwar State|Alwar]], [[Jaipur State|Amber]] (later called Jaipur) and [[Maihar]].\n\nThe Kachwaha are sometimes referred to as [[Kushwaha]]. This [[umbrella term]] is used to represent at least four communities with similar occupational backgrounds, all of whom claim descent from the mythological [[Suryavansh]] (Solar) dynasty via [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]], who was one of the twin sons of [[Rama]] and [[Sita]]. Previously, they had worshipped [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]].\n\n==Origins== \nThe modern-day Kushwaha community, of which the Kachwaha form a part, generally claim descent from Kusha, a son of the mythological [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]], Rama. This enables their claim to be of the Suryavansh dynasty but it is a myth of origin developed in the twentieth century. Prior to that time, the various branches that form the Kushwaha community -&nbsp;the Kachwahas, [[Kachhi (caste)|Kachhi]]s, [[Koeri]]s, and [[Murao]]s&nbsp;- favoured a connection with [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]].<ref name=Pinch1996pp91-92>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/12 12], 91\u201392 |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nGanga Prasad Gupta claimed in the 1920s that Kushwah families worshiped [[Hanuman]]&nbsp;- described by Pinch as \"the embodiment of true devotion to Ram and Sita\"&nbsp;- during [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]], a month in the [[Hindu calendar|Hindu lunar calendar]].<ref name=Pinch1996p98>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/98 98] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Rulers==\nA Kachwaha family ruled at Amber, which later became known as the [[Jaipur State]], and this branch is sometimes referred to as being Rajput. They were chiefs at Amber and in 1561 sought support from [[Akbar]], the [[Mughal empire|Mughal emperor]]. The then chief, [[Bharmal|Bharamail Kachwaha]], was formally recognised as a [[Raja]] and was invested into the Mughal nobility by the Mughal emperor Akbar. The Kachwaha ruler also married his daughter to Akbar for solidifying the new alliance. A governor was appointed to oversee Bharamail's territory and a [[tribute]] arrangement saw Bharamail given a salaried rank, paid for from a share of the area's revenue.<ref>{{cite book |title=Raja Nal and the Goddess: The North Indian Epic Dhola in Performance |first=Susan Snow |last=Wadley |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=2004 |isbn=9780253217240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbsgVL4AGkoC&pg=PA110 |pages=110-111}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Dancing Girl: A History of Early India |first=Balaji |last=Sadasivan |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2011 |isbn=9789814311670 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=980SAvbmpUkC&pg=PT255 |pages=233-234}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nThe Kushwaha were traditionally a peasant community and considered to be of the stigmatised [[Shudra]] [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/81 81] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> Pinch describes them as \"skilled agriculturalists\".<ref name=Pinch1996p92>{{cite book |title=Peasants and monks in British India |first=William R. |last=Pinch |publisher=University of California Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-520-20061-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/peasantsmonksinb0000pinc/page/92 92] |accessdate=22 February 2012}}</ref> The traditional perception of Shudra status was increasingly challenged during the later decades of [[British Raj]] rule, although various castes had made claims of a higher status well before the British administration instituted its first census.{{efn|William Pinch records that, \"...&nbsp;a popular concern with status predated the rise of an imperial census apparatus and the colonial obsession with caste.&nbsp;...
