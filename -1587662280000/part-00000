And although the U.S. Census Bureau does not report the areas of geographic entities, it does report their population densities (equal to the total population divided by the area).  In the 2010 census, the population was reported as 4,170 (Table P1, \"Total Population\") and the population density was reported as 211.8 per square mile (Table P40, \"Population Density\").

Saint John was uninhabited when 20 Danish planters came over from St. Thomas in 1717.  They grew [[sugar cane]], cotton, and other crops.  [[Annaberg, Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Annaberg]] sugar plantation is built in 1731, and becomes one of the island's largest sugar producers by the 1800s.  By 1733, there were 109 plantations on the island, 21 of which are producing sugar.  The islands became a crown colony in 1754.<ref name=VINPS/>{{rp|24}}\n\nThe [[1733 slave insurrection on St. John]] started when a small group of slaves entered Fort Frederiksvaern, on Fortsberg Hill in [[Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands|Coral Bay]], with [[cane knife|cane bills]] concealed within bundles of wood.  The slaves, led by those formerly from [[Akwamu]], overpowered and killed 5 of the 6 soldiers within the Danish fort.  Firing the fort's cannon, the signal was given for the start of a six-month revolt, which only ended when French troops were brought in from [[Martinique]].<ref name=VINPS/>{{rp|68\u201369}}\n\nInstead of submitting to captivity and slavery, more than a dozen men and women, including [[Breffu]], one of the leaders,<ref name=norton>{{cite thesis|title=Estate by Estate: The Landscape of the 1733 St. Jan Slave Rebellion|author=Holly Kathryn Norton|date=2013|type=PhD|publisher=Syracuse University|p=90|id={{ProQuest|1369397993}}}}</ref> shot and killed themselves before the French forces reached them.\n\n[[Moravian Brethren]] built the first church at [[Emmaus, U.S. Virgin Islands|Emmaus]] in 1749.

Denmark emancipated the slaves in 1848, and by 1850 many of the plantations were abandoned.

It was intended to prevent expansion of the [[German Empire]] into the [[Western Hemisphere]]. As part of the negotiations for this deal, the US agreed to recognize [[Denmark|Denmark's]] claim to [[Greenland]], which they had previously disputed.\n\nDuring the 20th century, private investors acquired properties on the island, redeveloping some plantation houses as vacation resorts, such as Laurence Rockefeller's [[Caneel_Bay|Caneel Bay]] Resort. The islands became popular and tourism and related service jobs developed as a major part of the economy.\n\n===Hurricane Irma===\n[[File:Pennsylvania National Guard (23944785038).jpg|thumb|A Pennsylvania National Guard soldier speaking to a resident of St. John]]\n\nIn September 2017, Saint John was hit by [[Hurricane Irma]].

Its residents are [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]], but they cannot vote in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]].\n\nUntil 1970, governors of the territory were appointed by the US President. Since that year, residents of the island have elected a territorial governor and lieutenant governor, and fifteen senators to the legislature, representing all three islands. Seven are elected from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large (who must be a resident of Saint John) are elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature.\n\nResidents of the Virgin Islands also elect a delegate to the US Congress, who has non-voting status in that body.\n\nSaint John has no local government; however, the Governor appoints an administrator for the island. Having no official powers, this figure acts more as an adviser to the Governor and as a spokesperson for the Governor's policies.\n\nThe main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the Independent Citizens Movement (ICM), and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands. Additional candidates run as independents.\n\n[[File:LeinsterBayTrailMap.JPG|thumb|upright|Leinster Bay Trail Map of Saint John's National Park]]\n\n===Voting===\n\n[[File:US Virgin Islands admin divisions.png|thumb|250px|Districts and subdistricts of the US Virgin Islands]]\nSaint John is divided into the following [[subdistrict]]s (with population as per the [[2010 U.S. Census]]):\n# Central (pop. 779)\n# [[Coral Bay, United States Virgin Islands|Coral Bay]] (pop. 634)\n# [[Cruz Bay, United States Virgin Islands|Cruz Bay]] (pop. 2,706)\n# East End (pop. 51)\n\nActivists filed a lawsuit on September 20, 2011 in the federal US District Court of the Virgin Islands seeking the right to be represented in Congress and to vote for U.S. President. The case is Civil No. 3:11-cv-110, ''Charles v. U.S. Federal Elections Commission et al.'' The case alleges the 1917 Congress, with all-white members, denied the right to vote to island residents due to racial discrimination, as the island had a majority of people of color. The case was dismissed on August 20, 2012.<ref>[https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/Virgin_Islands_District_Court/3--11-cv-00110/Charles_v._U.S._Federal_Election_Commission_et_al/ ''Charles v.

However, this industry declined after the abolition of slavery, as it was dependent on free labor to be profitable. In addition, in that period, it had to compete with sugar produced in other areas, including by the use of sugar beets in northern locations.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Tourism ===\nThe economy of Saint John is almost entirely dependent on tourism. The island has hundreds of rental villas as well as hotels and resorts. Numerous shops and restaurants serving both residents and tourists are located in Cruz Bay and Coral Bay.\n\nSaint John is a popular stop for day and term boat charters from the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]]. Individual and group boat charters are widely available on Saint John and island hopping is a favorite local and visitor activity. Popular day excursions include bar hopping or snorkeling at Christmas Cove, [[Jost Van Dyke]], [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Tortola]], [[Norman Island]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands|Water Island]], [[Lovango Cay, U.S. Virgin Islands|Lovongo Cay]], [[Cooper Island (British Virgin Islands)|Cooper Island]], and [[Peter Island]].

The remaining portion, the [[Caneel Bay]] Resort, operates on a lease arrangement with the NPS, which owns the underlying land.\n\nThe boundaries of the [[Virgin Islands National Park]] include 75% of the island, but various in-holdings within the park boundary (e.g., Peter Bay) reduce the park lands to 60% of the island acreage.\n\nMuch of the island's waters, [[coral reef]]s, and shoreline have been protected by being included in the national park. This protection was expanded in 2001, when the [[Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument]] was created.\n\n===Transport===\nWhile Saint John does not have an airport, the island is served by [[Cyril E.

She was 94 years old. Mrs. McCully was a secretary in New York City in 1947 when, on one of her frequent trips to the Caribbean, she first saw the island of St. John. She swam ashore with a basketful of belongings because the captain of her English cruise ship declined to dock at the then undeveloped island. Mrs. McCully, a small, outspoken woman, bought four acres, designed her dream house and spent 11 years struggling with suppliers, boat captains and workmen to build it. She described her tribulations in a book entitled ''Grandma Raised the Roof''. Her home, called ''Island Fancy'', was jeopardized in 1962 by a clause in a Congressional bill calling for the enlargement of the Virgin Islands National Park. The clause would have let the National Park Service acquire land on the island by condemnation. With other island homeowners, Mrs. McCully lobbied to get the provision struck from the bill. Some years ago, Mrs. McCully reluctantly sold the house to the Park Service with the proviso that she would have life tenancy.}}</ref>\n\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Caneel Bay Turtle Bay Beach 4.jpg|Turtle Bay Beach at Caneel Bay\nFile:Caneel Bay Sunset at Turtle Bay Beach 1.jpg|Sunset at Turtle Bay\nFile:Virgin Islands National Park Reef Bay.jpg|Reef Bay and Virgin Islands National Park from Cocoloba Point\nFile:Stjohntrunkbeahjan2020.jpg|thumb|Mid day Trunk Beach St John Virgin Islands National Park\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Outline of the United States Virgin Islands]]\n* [[Index of United States Virgin Islands-related articles]]\n* [[Bibliography of the United States Virgin Islands]]\n* [[Flanagan Island]]\n* [[Great Thatch]]\n* [[List of people from the United States Virgin Islands]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in the United States Virgin Islands#Saint John|National Register of Historic Places listings on Saint John]]\n* [[Norman Island]]\n* [[Piracy in the British Virgin Islands]]\n* [[Virgin Islands Coral Reef National Monument]]\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.stjohntradewindsnews.com/index.php ''St. John Tradewinds'']\u2014major Saint John newspaper, est. 1972\n* Rankin, D.W.

Saint John was uninhabited when 20 Danish planters came over from St. Thomas in 1717.  They grew [[sugar cane]], cotton, and other crops.  [[Annaberg, Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Annaberg]] sugar plantation is built in 1731, and becomes one of the island's largest sugar producers by the 1800s.  By 1733, there were 109 plantations on the island, 21 of which are producing sugar.  The islands became a crown colony in 1754.<ref name=VINPS/>{{rp|24}}\n\nThe [[1733 slave insurrection on St. John]] started when a small group of slaves entered Fort Frederiksvaern, on Fortsberg Hill in [[Coral Bay, U.S. Virgin Islands|Coral Bay]], with [[cane knife|cane bills]] concealed within bundles of wood.  The slaves, led by those formerly from [[Akwamu]], overpowered and killed 5 of the 6 soldiers within the Danish fort.

It was intended to prevent expansion of the [[German Empire]] into the [[Western Hemisphere]]. As part of the negotiations for this deal, the US agreed to recognize [[Denmark|Denmark's]] claim to [[Greenland]], which they had previously disputed.\n\nDuring the 20th century, private investors acquired properties on the island, redeveloping some plantation houses as vacation resorts, such as Laurence Rockefeller's Caneel Bay Resort.

Its residents are [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]], but they cannot vote in [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]].\n\nUntil 1970, governors of the territory were appointed by the US President. Since that year, residents of the island have elected a territorial governor and lieutenant governor, and fifteen senators to the legislature, representing all three islands. Seven are elected from the district of Saint Croix, seven from the district of Saint Thomas and Saint John, and one senator at-large (who must be a resident of Saint John) are elected for two-year terms to the unicameral Virgin Islands Legislature.\n\nResidents of the Virgin Islands also elect a delegate to the US Congress, who has non-voting status in that body.\n\nSaint John has no local government; however, the Governor appoints an administrator for the island. Having no official powers, this figure acts more as an adviser to the Governor and as a spokesperson for the Governor's policies.\n\nThe main political parties in the U.S. Virgin Islands are the Democratic Party of the Virgin Islands, the Independent Citizens Movement (ICM), and the Republican Party of the Virgin Islands.

The island has hundreds of rental villas as well as hotels and resorts. Numerous shops and restaurants serving both residents and tourists are located in Cruz Bay and Coral Bay.\n\nSaint John is a popular stop for day and term boat charters from the [[United States Virgin Islands]], [[Puerto Rico]], and the [[British Virgin Islands]]. Individual and group boat charters are widely available on Saint John and island hopping is a favorite local and visitor activity. Popular day excursions include bar hopping or snorkeling at Christmas Cove, [[Jost Van Dyke]], [[Buck Island National Wildlife Refuge]], [[Tortola]], [[Norman Island]], [[Virgin Gorda]], [[Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands|Water Island]], [[Lovango Cay, U.S. Virgin Islands|Lovongo Cay]], [[Cooper Island (British Virgin Islands)|Cooper Island]], and [[Peter Island]].

She was 94 years old. Mrs. McCully was a secretary in New York City in 1947 when, on one of her frequent trips to the Caribbean, she first saw the island of St. John. She swam ashore with a basketful of belongings because the captain of her English cruise ship declined to dock at the then undeveloped island. Mrs. McCully, a small, outspoken woman, bought four acres, designed her dream house and spent 11 years struggling with suppliers, boat captains and workmen to build it. She described her tribulations in a book entitled ''Grandma Raised the Roof''. Her home, called ''Island Fancy'', was jeopardized in 1962 by a clause in a Congressional bill calling for the enlargement of the Virgin Islands National Park. The clause would have let the National Park Service acquire land on the island by condemnation. With other island homeowners, Mrs. McCully lobbied to get the provision struck from the bill.

But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days.

But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body.\"</ref> Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].<ref>''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}</ref>\n\n====Funeral and mourning====\n\nHis body lay in state for two days and was [[Burial|buried]] with full state honours on 27 April 2011.<ref name=\"news9\">News 9, 24 April 2011, 16:00 IST</ref> An estimated 500,000 people attended the burial, among them the Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]], [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] president [[Sonia Gandhi]], then Gujarat Chief Minister [[Narendra Modi]] (India's Present Prime Minister), Cricketer [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and [[Union Minister]]s [[S.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]].

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

At the beginning, however, the Chinese Wikipedia did not support [[Chinese character]]s, and had no encyclopedic content.\n\nIn October 2002, the first Chinese-language page was written, the [[:zh:|Main Page]]. A [[software update]] on 27 October 2002 allowed Chinese language input. The domain was set to be [[:zh:|zh.wikipedia.org]], with '''zh''' based on the [[ISO 639-1|ISO code]] for the Chinese language. On 17 November 2002, the user Mountain translated the [[Computer science]] article into [[:zh:\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66]], thus creating its first real encyclopedic article.\n\nIn order to accommodate the orthographic differences between [[simplified Chinese characters]] and [[traditional Chinese characters]] (or Orthodox Chinese), from 2002 to 2003, the Chinese Wikipedia community gradually decided to combine the two originally separate versions of the Chinese Wikipedia. The first running automatic conversion between the two orthographic representations started on 23 December 2004, with the MediaWiki 1.4 release.

The first five sysops, or [[administrators (wikipedia)|administrators]], were promoted on 14 June 2003.\n\nWikipedia was first introduced by the mainland Chinese media{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} in the newspaper ''[[China Computer Education]]'' on 20 October 2003, in the article, \"I join to write an encyclopedia\" (\u6211\u4e5f\u6765\u5199\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66).<ref>\"[http://media.ccidnet.com/media/cce/540/04602.htm \u6211\u4e5f\u6765\u5199\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66].\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130131095348/http://media.ccidnet.com/media/cce/540/04602.htm Archive])</ref> On 16 May 2004, Wikipedia was first reported by Taiwanese media in the newspaper ''[[China Times]]''. Since then, many newspapers have published [[Wikipedia:Press coverage|articles about the Chinese Wikipedia]], and several sysops have been interviewed by journalists.\n\nIvan Zhai of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' wrote that the blocks from the Mainland authorities in the 2000s stifled the growth of the Chinese Wikipedia, and that by 2013 there was a new generation of users originating from the Mainland who were taking efforts to make the Chinese Wikipedia grow. In 2013, there were 1.4 million registered users on the Chinese Wikipedia, and in July 2013 7,500 of these users were active, with most of them originating from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 715,000 entries for the Chinese Wikipedia, making it the 12th largest Wikipedia.<ref name=ZhaiWikiReboot>Zhai, Ivan. \"[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1293878/wiki-reboot-chinese-wikipedia-makes-comeback-after-early Wiki reboot: Chinese Wikipedia makes comeback after early censorship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152217/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1293878/wiki-reboot-chinese-wikipedia-makes-comeback-after-early |date=24 September 2015 }}.\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.

The name ({{zh |t = \u7dad\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 |s = \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 |p = W\u00e9ij\u012b B\u01ceik\u0113}}) means \"Wiki Encyclopedia\". The [[Chinese character|Chinese transcription]] of \"Wiki\" is composed of two characters: \u7dad/\u7ef4, whose ancient sense refers to 'ropes or webs connecting objects', and alludes to the 'Internet'; and \u57fa, meaning the 'foundations of a building', or 'fundamental aspects of things in general'. The name can be interpreted as 'the encyclopedia that connects the fundamental knowledge of humanity'.\n\nThe most common Chinese translation for [[wiki]] technology is \u7dad\u57fa/\u7ef4\u57fa; however, it can be \u7dad\u5ba2/\u7ef4\u5ba2 (literally \"dimension visitor\" or similar) or \u570d\u7d00/\u56f4\u7eaa (literally \"circle/enclose period/record\" or similar), which are also transcriptions of the word \"wiki\". As a result, the term \u7dad\u57fa/\u7ef4\u57fa has become associated exclusively with Wikimedia projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddictbasic&wdqb=%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91&wdrst=0&go=Search |title=MDBG.net |publisher=MDBG.net |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205052408/http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddictbasic&wdqb=%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91&wdrst=0&go=Search |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Wikipedia also has a subtitle: \u6d77\u7d0d\u767e\u5ddd\uff0c\u6709\u5bb9\u4e43\u5927/\u6d77\u7eb3\u767e\u5ddd\uff0c\u6709\u5bb9\u4e43\u5927.

Just as [[English Wikipedia]] tends to be more detailed in [[Western world|western]]-related topics, the Chinese Wikipedia has very detailed descriptions of [[China]]-related topics. Within that region, the Chinese Wikipedia tends to be more detailed in topics about Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the wealthy east coast provinces of mainland China.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAlso due to the geographical origin of its participants, the most discussed and debated topics on the Chinese Wikipedia are political issues in Chinese modern history. For example, the six most edited articles as of August 2007 were [[Taiwan]], [[Chinese culture]], [[China]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and [[Hong Kong]], in that order. In contrast, issues such as the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]] are much less contentious.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDue to the audience base, Wikipedians from Mainland, Taiwan, and other areas had engaged in editing conflicts over political topics related to [[Cross-Straits relations]].<ref>Tsoi, Grace. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/technology/wikipedia-china-becomes-front-line-for-views-on-language-and-culture.html?_r=0 Wikipedia China Becomes Front Line for Views on Language and Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128124154/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/technology/wikipedia-china-becomes-front-line-for-views-on-language-and-culture.html?_r=0 |date=28 November 2018 }}.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. 27 October 2013. Retrieved on 29 October 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Administrators ===\nAs of June 2019, there are 78 administrators, or sysops. They are all elected by Chinese Wikipedians. Most of them come from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are also a few who come from the United States, Singapore, and Japan.\n\n=== Meetings ===\n[[File:2013\u5927\u8fde\u5bd2\u5047\u805a\u4f1a\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2013 Winter-Break-Meetup, [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]], [[China]].]]\n\nThe first Chinese Wikipedian meeting was held in [[Beijing]] on 25 July 2004. Since then, Chinese Wikipedians from different regions have held many gatherings in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Dalian]], [[Shenyang]], [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. Currently, a regular meetup is held once every two weeks in [[Shanghai]], [[Taipei]] and [[Hong Kong]], and once every month in [[Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]. In July 2006, Taiwanese Wikipedians also held a \"travelling meetup\", travelling by train through four Taiwanese cities over a period of two days. In August 2006, Hong Kong hosted the first annual [[m:CWMC 2006|Chinese Wikimedia Conference]].\n\nChinese Wikipedians advertise Wikipedia in different ways. Many of them use [[Microblogging in China|weibo]], a Chinese socializing website similar to Twitter. Several Chinese Wikipedians created the Wikipedia monthly magazine, or journal, called \"'''The Wikipedians'''\" in December 2012, which is currently published once a month.\n\n=== Systemic bias ===\nIn order to avoid [[systemic bias]], editors are advised to avoid writing from the point of view of China or any other country/region; to avoid using terms such as \u6211\u56fd/\u6211\u570b (\"our country\"; referring to the [[People's Republic of China]] or the [[Republic of China]], depending on viewpoint), \u672c\u6e2f (\"this port\"; referring to Hong Kong), or \u672c\u6fb3 (\"this Macau\", referring to Macau); and instead, to refer to locations in the Chinese-speaking sphere or periods in [[History of China|Chinese history]] by explicitly stating China (e.g. \"[[Yunnan]] province, China\", instead of just \"[[Yunnan]] province\").\n\n== Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese characters ==\n{{anchor|Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese}}\n\n=== Original situation ===\nOriginally, there were virtually two Chinese Wikipedias under the names of \"zh\" (or \"zh-cn\") and \"zh-tw\". Generally, users from regions that used [[Traditional Chinese characters]] (such as [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]) wrote and edited articles using Traditional Chinese characters whereas those from regions that used [[Simplified Chinese characters]] (such as [[mainland China]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]]) wrote using Simplified Chinese characters. Many articles had two uncoordinated versions; for example, there was both a Traditional ([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%B3%95%E5%9B%BD \u6cd5\u570b]) and Simplified ([[:zh:\u6cd5\u56fd|\u6cd5\u56fd]]) article on [[France]]. Further exacerbating the problem were differences in vocabulary (particularly nouns) and writing systems, between mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. For example, a [[computer printer]] is called {{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u6253\u5370\u673a|\u6253\u5370\u673a]]}} in mainland China, but {{lang|zh-Hant|[[:zh:\u5370\u8868\u6a5f|\u5370\u8868\u6a5f]]}} in Taiwan.\n\n=== Solution ===\nTo avoid this near-[[fork (software development)|forking]] of the project, starting around January 2005, the Chinese Wikipedia began providing a [[Server (computing)|server]]-side mechanism to automatically convert different characters and vocabulary items into the user's local ones, according to the user's preference settings, which may be set to one of two settings that convert the script only, or one of six settings that also take into account regional vocabulary differences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To provide an alternative means to harmonize the characters when the server-side converters fail to work properly, a special template was created to manually convert characters and article titles in one specific page.\n\nFurthermore, page title conversion is used for automatic page redirection. Those articles previously named in different characters or different translations have been merged, and can be reached by means of both Traditional and Simplified Chinese titles.\n\n== Differences with other versions of Wikipedia ==\nAccording to a survey conducted between April 2010 and March 2011, edits to the Chinese Wikipedia were 37.8% from [[Taiwan]], 26.2% from [[Hong Kong]], 17.7% from [[Mainland China]], 6.1% from [[United States]] and 2.3% from [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm|title=Page Edits Per Wikipedia Language|publisher=statswikimedia|access-date=9 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803213708/http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm|archive-date=3 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMany editing controversies arise from current and historical political events in Chinese-speaking regions, such as the [[political status of Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong independence|independent movement]] and [[Hong Kong Autonomy Movement|autonomy movement of Hong Kong]], [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], issues of the [[Communist Party of China]] and [[Kuomintang]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[WP:Speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] works in a similar way to the policy on the [[English Wikipedia]], but [[wp:proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] is unavailable.\n\n== Wikipedia in other varieties of Chinese ==\n[[File:Chinese wikipedia map.png|thumb|right|The countries in which the Chinese Wikipedia is the most popular language version of Wikipedia are shown in blue.

This [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is largely associated with the grammar and vocabulary of [[Standard Chinese]], the official spoken language of mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore (but not exclusively of Hong Kong and Macau, which largely use [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]).\n\nThe [[varieties of Chinese]] are a diverse group encompassing many regional varieties, most of which are [[mutually unintelligible]] and often divided up into several larger dialect groups, such as [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (including [[Shanghainese]] and [[Suzhounese]]), [[Min Nan]] (of which [[Taiwanese language|Taiwanese]] is a notable dialect), and [[Cantonese]]. In regions that speak non-Mandarin languages or regional Mandarin dialects, the Vernacular Chinese standard largely corresponding to Standard Chinese is nevertheless used exclusively as the Chinese written standard; this written standard differs sharply from the local dialects in [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]], and is often read in local [[pronunciation]] but preserving the vocabulary and grammar of [[Standard Chinese]]. After the founding of Wikipedia, many users of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties began to ask for the right to have Wikipedia editions in non-Mandarin varieties as well. However, they also met with significant opposition, based on the fact that Mandarin-based Vernacular Chinese is the only form used in scholarly or academic contexts. Some also proposed the implementation of an [[meta:Automatic conversion between simplified and traditional Chinese|automatic conversion program]] similar to that between Simplified and Traditional Chinese; however, others pointed out that although conversion between Simplified and Traditional Chinese consists mainly of [[glyph]] and sometimes vocabulary substitutions, different regional varieties of Chinese differ so sharply in grammar, [[syntax]], and [[semantics]] that it was unrealistic to implement an automatic conversion program.\n\nObjections notwithstanding, it was determined that these Chinese varieties were sufficiently different from Standard Chinese and had a sufficiently large number of followers to justify the creation of six Wikipedias for different varieties.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The Wu Wikipedia uses Simplified Chinese exclusively, and the Classical Chinese Wikipedia uses Traditional Chinese exclusively (The Gan and Cantonese Wikipedias default to Traditional, but have a conversion function similar to the Chinese Wikipedia). The [[Min Nan]] Wikipedia uses [[Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b]]. The [[Mindong Wikipedia]] and [[Hakka]] Wikipedias currently use [[B\u00e0ng-u\u00e2-c\u00ea]] and [[Pha\u030dk-fa-s\u1e73]] respectively, which can be converted to [[Traditional Chinese characters]], thus avoiding the issue completely.\n\n== Blocking of Wikipedia ==\n{{See also|The Great Firewall#Circumvention}}\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] and [[internet service provider]]s in [[Mainland China]] have adopted a [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|practice of blocking]] contentious Internet sites in [[mainland China]], and Wikimedia sites have been blocked at least three times in its history.<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\">{{cite news | last = Schwankert | first = Steven | title = Wikipedia Blocked in China Again | publisher = IDG News via PCworld | date = 6 September 2007 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136879-c,sites/article.html | accessdate = 26 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123035951/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136879-c,sites/article.html | archive-date = 23 November 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2015, Chinese Wikipedia was blocked again within mainland China.<ref>[http://help.3g.163.com/15/0519/19/AQ0K9GQ300964K9G.html \u4e2d\u6587\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u88ab\u5c4f\u853d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527040552/http://help.3g.163.com/15/0519/19/AQ0K9GQ300964K9G.html |date=27 May 2015 }}\uff0c[[NetEase]]\uff0cRetrieved 19 May 2015.</ref> Because all Wikipedias rely on HTTPS links, Chinese censors cannot see what page an individual is viewing; this also makes it more difficult to block a specific set of pages.\n\n=== First block ===\nThe first block lasted from 2 \u2013 21 June 2004.

The Chinese Wikipedia also has articles related to [[Taiwan independence]], written by contributors from Taiwan and elsewhere. A few days after the initial block of the Chinese Wikipedia, all [[Wikimedia Foundation]] sites were blocked in mainland China. In response to the blocks, two moderators prepared an appeal to lift the block and asked their regional [[internet service provider]] to submit it. All Wikimedia sites were unblocked between 17 and 21 June 2004. One month later, the first Chinese Wikipedian moderators' meeting was held in Beijing on 25 July 2004.\n\nThe first block had an effect on the vitality of the Chinese Wikipedia, which suffered sharp dips in various indicators, such as the number of new users, the number of new articles, and the number of edits. In some cases, it took anywhere from 6 to 12 months in order to regain the stats from May 2004. On the other hand, on today's site, some of the articles are put under protection which may last for a month or more without any actions.\n\n=== Second block ===\nThe second and less serious outage lasted between 23 and 27 September 2004. During this 4-day period, access to Wikipedia was erratic or unavailable to some users in mainland China &mdash; this block was not comprehensive and some users in mainland China were never affected. The exact reason for the block is a mystery. Chinese Wikipedians once again prepared a written appeal to regional ISPs, but the block was lifted before the appeal was actually sent, for an unknown reason.\n\n=== Third block and temporary unblocks ===\nThe third block began on 19 October 2005, and there was no indication as to whether this block was temporary or permanent, or what the reasons or causes for this block were. According to the [[:zh:Wikipedia:\u72b6\u51b5\u56de\u62a5|status page]] currently maintained on the Chinese Wikipedia, the [[Florida]] and [[Korea]] [[server (computing)|servers]] were blocked, whereas the [[Paris]] and [[Amsterdam]] servers were not. Dozens of editors from across [[mainland China]] [[:zh:Wikipedia talk:\u72b6\u51b5\u56de\u62a5|reported]] that they could only access Wikipedia using proxy servers, although there were isolated reports that some users could access Wikipedia without using a proxy. Most Chinese people were not able to connect to the site at all.\n\nDuring October and November 2006, it first appeared that the site was unblocked again. Many conflicting reports came from news outlets, bloggers, and Wikipedians, reporting a possible partial or full unblocking of Wikipedia. Some reports indicated a complete unblock; others suggested that some sensitive topics remained blocked, and yet others suggested that the Chinese Wikipedia was blocked whereas other-language versions were not. From 17 November onwards, the complete block was once again in place.\n\nOn 15 June 2007, China lifted the block for several articles, only to then block an increasing number of articles. On 30 August 2007, all blocks were lifted, but then a block was placed on Wikipedia for all languages on 31 August 2007.<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\"/> As of 26 January 2008, all languages of Wikipedia were blocked,<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\"/> and as of 2 April 2008, the block was lifted.<ref>{{cite news | last = Barak | first = Sylvie | title = China uncensors Wikipedia | publisher = The Inquirer | date = 3 April 2008 | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/03/china-uncensors-wikipedia | accessdate = 3 April 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406233620/http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/03/china-uncensors-wikipedia | archive-date = 6 April 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nBy 5 April 2008, the Chinese Wikipedia became difficult to access from the [[Sun Yat-Sen University]] in [[Guangzhou]]. Connections to the Chinese Wikipedia were completely blocked as of 6 April 2008. Any attempt to access the Chinese Wikipedia resulted in a 60-second ban on all Wikimedia websites. However, users were able to log on to the Chinese Wikipedia using https. All other languages were accessible, but politically sensitive searches such as [[Tibet]] were still blocked.\n\nOn 3 July 2008, the government lifted the ban on accessing the Chinese Wikipedia. However, some parts were still inaccessible. On 31 July 2008, [[BBC]] reported that the Chinese Wikipedia had been unblocked that day in China; it had still been blocked the previous day. This came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in [[Beijing]] to report on the upcoming [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], and websites like the Chinese edition of the BBC were being unblocked following talks between the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the Games' Chinese organizers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7535280.stm \"Beijing unblocks BBC Chinese site\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805004326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7535280.stm |date=5 August 2008 }}, BBC, 31 July 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Fourth block ===\n\nOn 19 May 2015 both the encrypted and unencrypted Chinese-language versions of Wikipedia were blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-smith/we-had-our-arguments-but-_b_7610130.html|title=We Had Our Arguments, But We Will Miss You Wikipedia|last=Smith|first=Charlie|date=18 June 2015|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=30 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619083431/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-smith/we-had-our-arguments-but-_b_7610130.html|archive-date=19 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Fifth block ===\nOn 23 April 2019, the first pages of Wikipedia and Wikipedia projects in all languages including English were blocked by the Chinese government using [[DNS spoofing|DNS pollution]].\n\nOn 24 April 2019, on the basis of being blocked by DNS, all language versions of Wikipedia were blocked by SNI.\n\n== Self-censorship allegations ==\n{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}\nIn December 2006, the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' Asia-Pacific<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061201143523/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/29/news/wiki.php \"Chinese-language Wikipedia presents different view of history\"] by Howard W.

French, titled \"Wikipedia lays bare two versions of China's past.\"\n\n{{bquote|Some say the object should be to spread reliable information as widely as possible, and that, in any case, self-censorship is pointless because the government still frequently blocks access to Wikipedia for most Chinese Internet users. 'There is a lot of confusion about whether they should obey the neutral point of view or offer some compromises to the government,' said Isaac Mao, a well-known Chinese blogger and user of the encyclopedia. 'To the local Wikipedians, the first objective is to make it well known among Chinese, to get people to understand the principles of Wikipedia step by step, and not to get the thing blocked by the government.}}\n\nThe report was subsequently repeated by CBS<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/11/30/publiceye/entry2218394.shtml \"Is Wikipedia China Really Wikipedia?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106132613/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/11/30/publiceye/entry2218394.shtml |date=6 January 2007 }} Posted by Brian Montopoli at 11:45 AM, 30 November 2006</ref> and by Chinese-language media outlets such as the ''[[Apple Daily]]'' in Taiwan.\n\nSome Chinese Wikipedians then tried to clarify the situation. One Chinese Wikipedian sent a comment that was subsequently published in the ''Apple Daily'' in Taiwan. The comment stated:\n\n{{bquote|... control over our content does not stem from any political motive, and we try to the extent of our abilities (even if we cannot do it perfectly) to prevent the influence of ideology; the motive, goal, and standards of control are very clear: to create an encyclopedia with rich content, good quality, and open copyright. All of our editing and deletion policies stem from this. There is no doubt about this point, and this will not change under any political pressure or personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the description of Mao Zedong on the Chinese Wikipedia, one can simply go online and see for oneself; in order to understand the operation of Wikipedia or to edit it oneself, just a few more mouse clicks would suffice. As Wikipedia continues to attract awareness, the number of users is increasing, and the media has increased interest in Wikipedia as well. Unfortunately, even a reputable international media source such as the ''New York Times'' was unable to find out the actual situation before passing biased judgment on Wikipedia. We can also see here that in quoting media overseas, even a notable one, one must still be cautious and check once again for oneself.

At the beginning, however, the Chinese Wikipedia did not support [[Chinese character]]s, and had no encyclopedic content.\n\nIn October 2002, the first Chinese-language page was written, the [[:zh:|Main Page]]. A [[software update]] on 27 October 2002 allowed Chinese language input. The domain was set to be [[:zh:|zh.wikipedia.org]], with '''zh''' based on the [[ISO 639-1|ISO code]] for the Chinese language. On 17 November 2002, the user Mountain translated the [[Computer science]] article into [[:zh:\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u79d1\u5b66]], thus creating its first real encyclopedic article.\n\nIn order to accommodate the orthographic differences between [[simplified Chinese characters]] and [[traditional Chinese characters]] (or Orthodox Chinese), from 2002 to 2003, the Chinese Wikipedia community gradually decided to combine the two originally separate versions of the Chinese Wikipedia. The first running automatic conversion between the two orthographic representations started on 23 December 2004, with the MediaWiki 1.4 release.

The first five sysops, or [[administrators (wikipedia)|administrators]], were promoted on 14 June 2003.\n\nWikipedia was first introduced by the mainland Chinese media{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} in the newspaper ''[[China Computer Education]]'' on 20 October 2003, in the article, \"I join to write an encyclopedia\" (\u6211\u4e5f\u6765\u5199\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66).<ref>\"[http://media.ccidnet.com/media/cce/540/04602.htm \u6211\u4e5f\u6765\u5199\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66].\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20130131095348/http://media.ccidnet.com/media/cce/540/04602.htm Archive])</ref> On 16 May 2004, Wikipedia was first reported by Taiwanese media in the newspaper ''[[China Times]]''. Since then, many newspapers have published [[Wikipedia:Press coverage|articles about the Chinese Wikipedia]], and several sysops have been interviewed by journalists.\n\nIvan Zhai of the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' wrote that the blocks from the Mainland authorities in the 2000s stifled the growth of the Chinese Wikipedia, and that by 2013 there was a new generation of users originating from the Mainland who were taking efforts to make the Chinese Wikipedia grow. In 2013, there were 1.4 million registered users on the Chinese Wikipedia, and in July 2013 7,500 of these users were active, with most of them originating from Hong Kong and Taiwan. 715,000 entries for the Chinese Wikipedia, making it the 12th largest Wikipedia.<ref name=ZhaiWikiReboot>Zhai, Ivan. \"[http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1293878/wiki-reboot-chinese-wikipedia-makes-comeback-after-early Wiki reboot: Chinese Wikipedia makes comeback after early censorship] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152217/http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/article/1293878/wiki-reboot-chinese-wikipedia-makes-comeback-after-early |date=24 September 2015 }}.\" ''[[South China Morning Post]]''.

The name ({{zh |t = \u7dad\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 |s = \u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1 |p = W\u00e9ij\u012b B\u01ceik\u0113}}) means \"Wiki Encyclopedia\". The [[Chinese character|Chinese transcription]] of \"Wiki\" is composed of two characters: \u7dad/\u7ef4, whose ancient sense refers to 'ropes or webs connecting objects', and alludes to the 'Internet'; and \u57fa, meaning the 'foundations of a building', or 'fundamental aspects of things in general'. The name can be interpreted as 'the encyclopedia that connects the fundamental knowledge of humanity'.\n\nThe most common Chinese translation for [[wiki]] technology is \u7dad\u57fa/\u7ef4\u57fa; however, it can be \u7dad\u5ba2/\u7ef4\u5ba2 (literally \"dimension visitor\" or similar) or \u570d\u7d00/\u56f4\u7eaa (literally \"circle/enclose period/record\" or similar), which are also transcriptions of the word \"wiki\". As a result, the term \u7dad\u57fa/\u7ef4\u57fa has become associated exclusively with Wikimedia projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddictbasic&wdqb=%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91&wdrst=0&go=Search |title=MDBG.net |publisher=MDBG.net |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205052408/http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddictbasic&wdqb=%E7%BB%B4%E5%9F%BA%E7%99%BE%E7%A7%91&wdrst=0&go=Search |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Wikipedia also has a subtitle: \u6d77\u7d0d\u767e\u5ddd\uff0c\u6709\u5bb9\u4e43\u5927/\u6d77\u7eb3\u767e\u5ddd\uff0c\u6709\u5bb9\u4e43\u5927.

Just as [[English Wikipedia]] tends to be more detailed in [[Western world|western]]-related topics, the Chinese Wikipedia has very detailed descriptions of [[China]]-related topics. Within that region, the Chinese Wikipedia tends to be more detailed in topics about Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the wealthy east coast provinces of mainland China.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAlso due to the geographical origin of its participants, the most discussed and debated topics on the Chinese Wikipedia are political issues in Chinese modern history. For example, the six most edited articles as of August 2007 were [[Taiwan]], [[Chinese culture]], [[China]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Chiang Kai-shek]], and [[Hong Kong]], in that order. In contrast, issues such as the [[Israel-Palestinian conflict]] are much less contentious.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nDue to the audience base, Wikipedians from Mainland, Taiwan, and other areas had engaged in editing conflicts over political topics related to [[Cross-Straits relations]].<ref>Tsoi, Grace. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/technology/wikipedia-china-becomes-front-line-for-views-on-language-and-culture.html?_r=0 Wikipedia China Becomes Front Line for Views on Language and Culture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181128124154/https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/technology/wikipedia-china-becomes-front-line-for-views-on-language-and-culture.html?_r=0 |date=28 November 2018 }}.\" ''[[The New York Times]]''. 27 October 2013. Retrieved on 29 October 2013.</ref>\n\n=== Administrators ===\nAs of June 2019, there are 78 administrators, or sysops. They are all elected by Chinese Wikipedians. Most of them come from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. There are also a few who come from the United States, Singapore, and Japan.\n\n=== Meetings ===\n[[File:2013\u5927\u8fde\u5bd2\u5047\u805a\u4f1a\u5408\u5f71.jpg|thumb|right|250px|2013 Winter-Break-Meetup, [[Dalian]], [[Liaoning]], [[China]].]]\n\nThe first Chinese Wikipedian meeting was held in [[Beijing]] on 25 July 2004. Since then, Chinese Wikipedians from different regions have held many gatherings in [[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Dalian]], [[Shenyang]], [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Taiwan]]. Currently, a regular meetup is held once every two weeks in [[Shanghai]], [[Taipei]] and [[Hong Kong]], and once every month in [[Tainan City]], [[Taiwan]]. In July 2006, Taiwanese Wikipedians also held a \"travelling meetup\", travelling by train through four Taiwanese cities over a period of two days. In August 2006, Hong Kong hosted the first annual [[m:CWMC 2006|Chinese Wikimedia Conference]].\n\nChinese Wikipedians advertise Wikipedia in different ways. Many of them use [[Microblogging in China|weibo]], a Chinese socializing website similar to Twitter. Several Chinese Wikipedians created the Wikipedia monthly magazine, or journal, called \"'''The Wikipedians'''\" in December 2012, which is currently published once a month.\n\n=== Systemic bias ===\nIn order to avoid [[systemic bias]], editors are advised to avoid writing from the point of view of China or any other country/region; to avoid using terms such as \u6211\u56fd/\u6211\u570b (\"our country\"; referring to the [[People's Republic of China]] or the [[Republic of China]], depending on viewpoint), \u672c\u6e2f (\"this port\"; referring to Hong Kong), or \u672c\u6fb3 (\"this Macau\", referring to Macau); and instead, to refer to locations in the Chinese-speaking sphere or periods in [[History of China|Chinese history]] by explicitly stating China (e.g. \"[[Yunnan]] province, China\", instead of just \"[[Yunnan]] province\").\n\n== Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese characters ==\n{{anchor|Automatic conversion between traditional and simplified Chinese}}\n\n=== Original situation ===\nOriginally, there were virtually two Chinese Wikipedias under the names of \"zh\" (or \"zh-cn\") and \"zh-tw\". Generally, users from regions that used [[Traditional Chinese characters]] (such as [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]) wrote and edited articles using Traditional Chinese characters whereas those from regions that used [[Simplified Chinese characters]] (such as [[mainland China]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]]) wrote using Simplified Chinese characters. Many articles had two uncoordinated versions; for example, there was both a Traditional ([https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E6%B3%95%E5%9B%BD \u6cd5\u570b]) and Simplified ([[:zh:\u6cd5\u56fd|\u6cd5\u56fd]]) article on [[France]]. Further exacerbating the problem were differences in vocabulary (particularly nouns) and writing systems, between mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore. For example, a [[computer printer]] is called {{lang|zh-Hans|[[:zh:\u6253\u5370\u673a|\u6253\u5370\u673a]]}} in mainland China, but {{lang|zh-Hant|[[:zh:\u5370\u8868\u6a5f|\u5370\u8868\u6a5f]]}} in Taiwan.\n\n=== Solution ===\nTo avoid this near-[[fork (software development)|forking]] of the project, starting around January 2005, the Chinese Wikipedia began providing a [[Server (computing)|server]]-side mechanism to automatically convert different characters and vocabulary items into the user's local ones, according to the user's preference settings, which may be set to one of two settings that convert the script only, or one of six settings that also take into account regional vocabulary differences:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To provide an alternative means to harmonize the characters when the server-side converters fail to work properly, a special template was created to manually convert characters and article titles in one specific page.\n\nFurthermore, page title conversion is used for automatic page redirection. Those articles previously named in different characters or different translations have been merged, and can be reached by means of both Traditional and Simplified Chinese titles.\n\n== Differences with other versions of Wikipedia ==\nAccording to a survey conducted between April 2010 and March 2011, edits to the Chinese Wikipedia were 37.8% from [[Taiwan]], 26.2% from [[Hong Kong]], 17.7% from [[Mainland China]], 6.1% from [[United States]] and 2.3% from [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm|title=Page Edits Per Wikipedia Language|publisher=statswikimedia|access-date=9 August 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803213708/http://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageEditsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm|archive-date=3 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMany editing controversies arise from current and historical political events in Chinese-speaking regions, such as the [[political status of Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong independence|independent movement]] and [[Hong Kong Autonomy Movement|autonomy movement of Hong Kong]], [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], issues of the [[Communist Party of China]] and [[Kuomintang]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[WP:Speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] works in a similar way to the policy on the [[English Wikipedia]], but [[wp:proposed deletion|proposed deletion]] is unavailable.\n\n== Wikipedia in other varieties of Chinese ==\n[[File:Chinese wikipedia map.png|thumb|right|The countries in which the Chinese Wikipedia is the most popular language version of Wikipedia are shown in blue.

This [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is largely associated with the grammar and vocabulary of [[Standard Chinese]], the official spoken language of mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore (but not exclusively of Hong Kong and Macau, which largely use [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]).\n\nThe [[varieties of Chinese]] are a diverse group encompassing many regional varieties, most of which are [[mutually unintelligible]] and often divided up into several larger dialect groups, such as [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (including [[Shanghainese]] and [[Suzhounese]]), [[Min Nan]] (of which [[Taiwanese language|Taiwanese]] is a notable dialect), and [[Cantonese]]. In regions that speak non-Mandarin languages or regional Mandarin dialects, the Vernacular Chinese standard largely corresponding to Standard Chinese is nevertheless used exclusively as the Chinese written standard; this written standard differs sharply from the local dialects in [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar]], and is often read in local [[pronunciation]] but preserving the vocabulary and grammar of [[Standard Chinese]]. After the founding of Wikipedia, many users of non-Mandarin Chinese varieties began to ask for the right to have Wikipedia editions in non-Mandarin varieties as well. However, they also met with significant opposition, based on the fact that Mandarin-based Vernacular Chinese is the only form used in scholarly or academic contexts. Some also proposed the implementation of an [[meta:Automatic conversion between simplified and traditional Chinese|automatic conversion program]] similar to that between Simplified and Traditional Chinese; however, others pointed out that although conversion between Simplified and Traditional Chinese consists mainly of [[glyph]] and sometimes vocabulary substitutions, different regional varieties of Chinese differ so sharply in grammar, [[syntax]], and [[semantics]] that it was unrealistic to implement an automatic conversion program.\n\nObjections notwithstanding, it was determined that these Chinese varieties were sufficiently different from Standard Chinese and had a sufficiently large number of followers to justify the creation of six Wikipedias for different varieties.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The Wu Wikipedia uses Simplified Chinese exclusively, and the Classical Chinese Wikipedia uses Traditional Chinese exclusively (The Gan and Cantonese Wikipedias default to Traditional, but have a conversion function similar to the Chinese Wikipedia). The [[Min Nan]] Wikipedia uses [[Pe\u030dh-\u014de-j\u012b]]. The [[Mindong Wikipedia]] and [[Hakka]] Wikipedias currently use [[B\u00e0ng-u\u00e2-c\u00ea]] and [[Pha\u030dk-fa-s\u1e73]] respectively, which can be converted to [[Traditional Chinese characters]], thus avoiding the issue completely.\n\n== Blocking of Wikipedia ==\n{{See also|The Great Firewall#Circumvention}}\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] and [[internet service provider]]s in [[Mainland China]] have adopted a [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|practice of blocking]] contentious Internet sites in [[mainland China]], and Wikimedia sites have been blocked at least three times in its history.<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\">{{cite news | last = Schwankert | first = Steven | title = Wikipedia Blocked in China Again | publisher = IDG News via PCworld | date = 6 September 2007 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136879-c,sites/article.html | accessdate = 26 January 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123035951/http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,136879-c,sites/article.html | archive-date = 23 November 2007 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2015, Chinese Wikipedia was blocked again within mainland China.<ref>[http://help.3g.163.com/15/0519/19/AQ0K9GQ300964K9G.html \u4e2d\u6587\u7ef4\u57fa\u767e\u79d1\u88ab\u5c4f\u853d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527040552/http://help.3g.163.com/15/0519/19/AQ0K9GQ300964K9G.html |date=27 May 2015 }}\uff0c[[NetEase]]\uff0cRetrieved 19 May 2015.</ref> Because all Wikipedias rely on HTTPS links, Chinese censors cannot see what page an individual is viewing; this also makes it more difficult to block a specific set of pages.\n\n=== First block ===\nThe first block lasted from 2 \u2013 21 June 2004.

The Chinese Wikipedia also has articles related to [[Taiwan independence]], written by contributors from Taiwan and elsewhere. A few days after the initial block of the Chinese Wikipedia, all [[Wikimedia Foundation]] sites were blocked in mainland China. In response to the blocks, two moderators prepared an appeal to lift the block and asked their regional [[internet service provider]] to submit it. All Wikimedia sites were unblocked between 17 and 21 June 2004. One month later, the first Chinese Wikipedian moderators' meeting was held in Beijing on 25 July 2004.\n\nThe first block had an effect on the vitality of the Chinese Wikipedia, which suffered sharp dips in various indicators, such as the number of new users, the number of new articles, and the number of edits. In some cases, it took anywhere from 6 to 12 months in order to regain the stats from May 2004. On the other hand, on today's site, some of the articles are put under protection which may last for a month or more without any actions.\n\n=== Second block ===\nThe second and less serious outage lasted between 23 and 27 September 2004. During this 4-day period, access to Wikipedia was erratic or unavailable to some users in mainland China &mdash; this block was not comprehensive and some users in mainland China were never affected. The exact reason for the block is a mystery. Chinese Wikipedians once again prepared a written appeal to regional ISPs, but the block was lifted before the appeal was actually sent, for an unknown reason.\n\n=== Third block and temporary unblocks ===\nThe third block began on 19 October 2005, and there was no indication as to whether this block was temporary or permanent, or what the reasons or causes for this block were. According to the [[:zh:Wikipedia:\u72b6\u51b5\u56de\u62a5|status page]] currently maintained on the Chinese Wikipedia, the [[Florida]] and [[Korea]] [[server (computing)|servers]] were blocked, whereas the [[Paris]] and [[Amsterdam]] servers were not. Dozens of editors from across [[mainland China]] [[:zh:Wikipedia talk:\u72b6\u51b5\u56de\u62a5|reported]] that they could only access Wikipedia using proxy servers, although there were isolated reports that some users could access Wikipedia without using a proxy. Most Chinese people were not able to connect to the site at all.\n\nDuring October and November 2006, it first appeared that the site was unblocked again. Many conflicting reports came from news outlets, bloggers, and Wikipedians, reporting a possible partial or full unblocking of Wikipedia. Some reports indicated a complete unblock; others suggested that some sensitive topics remained blocked, and yet others suggested that the Chinese Wikipedia was blocked whereas other-language versions were not. From 17 November onwards, the complete block was once again in place.\n\nOn 15 June 2007, China lifted the block for several articles, only to then block an increasing number of articles. On 30 August 2007, all blocks were lifted, but then a block was placed on Wikipedia for all languages on 31 August 2007.<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\"/> As of 26 January 2008, all languages of Wikipedia were blocked,<ref name = \"Schwankert_PCworld\"/> and as of 2 April 2008, the block was lifted.<ref>{{cite news | last = Barak | first = Sylvie | title = China uncensors Wikipedia | publisher = The Inquirer | date = 3 April 2008 | url = http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/03/china-uncensors-wikipedia | accessdate = 3 April 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080406233620/http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/04/03/china-uncensors-wikipedia | archive-date = 6 April 2008 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nBy 5 April 2008, the Chinese Wikipedia became difficult to access from the [[Sun Yat-Sen University]] in [[Guangzhou]]. Connections to the Chinese Wikipedia were completely blocked as of 6 April 2008. Any attempt to access the Chinese Wikipedia resulted in a 60-second ban on all Wikimedia websites. However, users were able to log on to the Chinese Wikipedia using https. All other languages were accessible, but politically sensitive searches such as [[Tibet]] were still blocked.\n\nOn 3 July 2008, the government lifted the ban on accessing the Chinese Wikipedia. However, some parts were still inaccessible. On 31 July 2008, [[BBC]] reported that the Chinese Wikipedia had been unblocked that day in China; it had still been blocked the previous day. This came within the context of foreign journalists arriving in [[Beijing]] to report on the upcoming [[2008 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]], and websites like the Chinese edition of the BBC were being unblocked following talks between the [[International Olympic Committee]] and the Games' Chinese organizers.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7535280.stm \"Beijing unblocks BBC Chinese site\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805004326/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7535280.stm |date=5 August 2008 }}, BBC, 31 July 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Fourth block ===\n\nOn 19 May 2015 both the encrypted and unencrypted Chinese-language versions of Wikipedia were blocked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-smith/we-had-our-arguments-but-_b_7610130.html|title=We Had Our Arguments, But We Will Miss You Wikipedia|last=Smith|first=Charlie|date=18 June 2015|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=30 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619083431/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charlie-smith/we-had-our-arguments-but-_b_7610130.html|archive-date=19 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Fifth block ===\nOn 23 April 2019, the first pages of Wikipedia and Wikipedia projects in all languages including English were blocked by the Chinese government using [[DNS spoofing|DNS pollution]].\n\nOn 24 April 2019, on the basis of being blocked by DNS, all language versions of Wikipedia were blocked by SNI.\n\n== Self-censorship allegations ==\n{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}\nIn December 2006, the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' Asia-Pacific<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061201143523/http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/29/news/wiki.php \"Chinese-language Wikipedia presents different view of history\"] by Howard W.

'There is a lot of confusion about whether they should obey the neutral point of view or offer some compromises to the government,' said Isaac Mao, a well-known Chinese blogger and user of the encyclopedia. 'To the local Wikipedians, the first objective is to make it well known among Chinese, to get people to understand the principles of Wikipedia step by step, and not to get the thing blocked by the government.}}\n\nThe report was subsequently repeated by CBS<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/11/30/publiceye/entry2218394.shtml \"Is Wikipedia China Really Wikipedia?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106132613/http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/11/30/publiceye/entry2218394.shtml |date=6 January 2007 }} Posted by Brian Montopoli at 11:45 AM, 30 November 2006</ref> and by Chinese-language media outlets such as the ''[[Apple Daily]]'' in Taiwan.\n\nSome Chinese Wikipedians then tried to clarify the situation. One Chinese Wikipedian sent a comment that was subsequently published in the ''Apple Daily'' in Taiwan. The comment stated:\n\n{{bquote|... control over our content does not stem from any political motive, and we try to the extent of our abilities (even if we cannot do it perfectly) to prevent the influence of ideology; the motive, goal, and standards of control are very clear: to create an encyclopedia with rich content, good quality, and open copyright. All of our editing and deletion policies stem from this. There is no doubt about this point, and this will not change under any political pressure or personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the description of Mao Zedong on the Chinese Wikipedia, one can simply go online and see for oneself; in order to understand the operation of Wikipedia or to edit it oneself, just a few more mouse clicks would suffice. As Wikipedia continues to attract awareness, the number of users is increasing, and the media has increased interest in Wikipedia as well. Unfortunately, even a reputable international media source such as the ''New York Times'' was unable to find out the actual situation before passing biased judgment on Wikipedia. We can also see here that in quoting media overseas, even a notable one, one must still be cautious and check once again for oneself.

Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy.

The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries. The congress established [[African independence movements|national liberation]] as the main topic of their sessions, emphasizing the elimination and exploitation by the imperialist powers over authentic national sovereignty. However, they did not establish clear social or political parameters for this new liberation.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/>\n\nAfrican leaders consistently viewed socialism as a direct rejection of the [[Colonisation of Africa|colonial system]] and in turn dismissed the notion of creating independent capitalist systems throughout the continent. They attempted to infuse various forms of socialism\u2014some Marxist\u2013Leninist, others democratic\u2014into tailored ideologies specific to each country.<ref name=\"Mushkat\"/> Once these systems were in place, countries developed towards a \"focal institutional\" society.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century.

When he visited Venezuela in May 1981, Hayek was asked to comment on the prevalence of totalitarian regimes in Latin America. In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay)\" and condemned \"wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not\" whilst emphasizing equality, by which they meant \"free education and medical care, little disparity in housing or salaries, and so forth\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McFarland|first1=Sam|last2=Ageyev|first2=Vladimir|last3=Abalakina-Paap|first3=Marina|title=Authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=63|issue=6|pages=1004\u20131010|date=1992|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.63.6.1004|citeseerx=10.1.1.397.4546}}</ref>\n\nWhen asked to comment on the claim that former citizens of socialist states now enjoy increased freedoms, [[Heinz Kessler]], former [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)|East German Minister of National Defence]], replied: \"Millions of people in Eastern Europe are now free from employment, free from safe streets, free from health care, free from social security\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Parenti|first=Michael|title=Blackshirts and Reds: Rational Fascism and the Overthrow of Communism|year=1997|publisher=City Lights Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87286-330-9|page=118}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation of industry ===\nAs authoritarian powers enforce socialist economics, the process often goes hand in hand with supporting the growth of heavy industry as a means of reaching [[industrialization]] (as can be seen with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s control of the [[Soviet Union]]).

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with.

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]].

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party.

Libertarian communists, including [[Anarcho-communism|anarchists]], [[Council communism|councillists]], [[Left communism|leftists]] and [[Libertarian Marxism|Marxists]], also reject the concept of a socialist state for being antithetical to socialism, but they believe that socialism and communism can only be established through [[revolution]] and dissolving the existence of the state.
