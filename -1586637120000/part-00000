The Ming dynasty ended when [[Shun dynasty|Shun]] forces led by [[Li Zicheng]] captured [[Beijing]] and the last Ming emperor [[Chongzhen Emperor|Chongzhen]] committed suicide. The Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] then opened the gates of the [[Shanhai Pass]] in the eastern section of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to the multi-ethnic [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Eight Banners|banners]], in hope of using them to annihilate the Shun forces. Ming loyalists fled to [[Nanjing]], where they enthroned [[Zhu Yousong]] as the Hongguang Emperor, marking the start of the Southern Ming. The Nanjing regime lasted until 1645, when Qing forces captured Nanjing. Later, a series of pretenders held court in various southern Chinese cities.<ref>See ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&pg= The Oxford History of Historical Writing: 1400\u20131800]'' (2011) by Jose Rabasa, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThe Nanjing regime lacked the resources to pay and supply its soldiers, who were left to live off the land and pillaged the countryside.<ref>It was projected that 7 million [[tael]]s would be required to fund military activity alone. Revenue of 6 million taels was anticipated based on normal receipts from the areas under Nanjing's control. Severe drought, rebellion, and unsettled conditions combined to ensure that actual revenue was only a fraction of this amount. (''The Cambridge History of China: The Ming Dynasty, 1368\u20131644'', pt. 1, p. 645).</ref> The soldiers' behavior was so notorious that they were refused entry by those cities in a position to do so.<ref>Wakeman, Volume 1, p. 354.</ref> Court official [[Shi Kefa]] obtained modern [[cannon]]s and organized resistance at [[Yangzhou]]. The cannons mowed down a large number of Qing soldiers, but this only enraged those who survived. After the Yangzhou city fell in May 1645, the Manchus started a general massacre pillage and enslaved all the women and children in the notorious [[Yangzhou massacre]]. Nanjing captured promptly by Qing on June 6 and the Prince of Fu was taken to Beijing and executed in 1646.\n\nThe literati in the provinces responded to the news from Yangzhou and Nanjing with an outpouring of emotion. Some recruited their own militia and became resistance leaders. Shi was lionized and there was a wave of hopeless sacrifice by loyalists who vowed to erase the shame of Nanjing. By late 1646, the heroics had petered out and the Qing advance had resumed. Notable Ming pretenders held court in [[Fuzhou]] (1645\u20131646), [[Guangzhou]] (1646\u20131647), and [[Anlong]] (1652\u20131659). The [[Zhu Shugui|Prince of Ningjing]] maintained a palace in the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] (based in modern-day [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]]) until 1683.\n\nThe end of the Ming and the subsequent Nanjing regime are depicted in ''[[Peach Blossom Fan]]'', a classic of [[Chinese literature]]. The upheaval of this period, sometimes referred to as the [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Ming\u2013Qing cataclysm]], has been linked{{Citation needed|reason=Little ice age makes no mention of this incident and timeframe does not line up|date=March 2020}} to a decline in [[global temperature]] known as the [[Little Ice Age]]. With agriculture devastated by a severe drought, there was manpower available for numerous rebel armies.\n\n==Background==\nThe fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] conquest that followed was a period of catastrophic war and population decline in China, comparable to Europe's [[Thirty Years War]] (1618\u20131648). China experienced a period of extremely cold weather from the 1620s until the 1710s.<ref>\"[http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2010/06/30/china%E2%80%99s-2000-year-temperature-history/ China\u2019s 2,000 Year Temperature History]\"</ref> Some modern scholars link the worldwide drop in temperature at this time to the [[Maunder Minimum]], an extended period from 1645 to 1715 when sunspots were absent.<ref>Eddy, John A., \"The Maunder Minimum: Sunspots and Climate in the Age of Louis XIV\", ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KS6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]'' edited by Geoffrey Parker, Lesley M. Smith.</ref> Whatever the cause, the change in the climate reduced agricultural yields and cut state revenue. It also led to drought, which displaced many peasants. There were a series of peasant revolts in the late Ming, culminating in a revolt led by [[Li Zicheng]] which overthrew the dynasty in 1644.\n\nMing ideology emphasized authoritarian and centralized administration, referred to as \"imperial supremacy\" or ''hu\u00e1ngj\u00ed''. However, comprehensive central decision-making was beyond the technology of the time.<ref>\"Government finance under the Ming represented an attempt to impose and extremely ambitious centralized system on an enormous empire before its level of technology had made such a degree of centralization practical.\" Ray Huang, ''Taxation and Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China'', p. 313.</ref> The principle of uniformity meant that the lowest common denominator was often selected as the standard. The need to implement change on an empire-wide basis complicated any effort to reform the system, leaving administrators helpless to respond in an age of upheaval.\n\nCivil servants were selected by an arduous examination system which tested knowledge of classic literature. While they might be adapt at citing precedents from the [[Zhou dynasty]] of righteous and unrighteous behavior, they were rarely as knowledgeable when it came to contemporary economic, social, or military matters. Unlike previous dynasties, the Ming had no prime minister. So when a young ruler retreated to the inner court to enjoy the company of his concubines, power devolved to the eunuchs.<ref>Tong, James, ''Disorder Under Heaven: Collective Violence in the Ming Dynasty'' (1991), p. 112.</ref> Only the eunuchs had access to the inner court, but the eunuch cliques were distrusted by the officials who were expected to carry out the emperor's decrees. Officials educated at the [[Donglin Academy]] were known for accusing the eunuchs and others of a lack of righteousness.\n\nOn April 24, 1644, Li's soldiers breached the walls of the Ming capital [[Beijing]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide the next day to avoid humiliation at their hands. Remnants of the [[House of Zhu|Ming imperial family]] and some court ministers then sought refuge in the southern part of China and regrouped around [[Nanjing]], the Ming auxiliary capital, south of the [[Yangtze River]]. Four different power groups thus emerged:\n* The [[Shun dynasty|Great Shun]] (\u5927\u9806), led by Li Zicheng, ruled north of the [[Huai River|Huai river]].\n* [[Zhang Xianzhong]]'s Great Xi (\u5927\u897f) controlled [[Sichuan]] province.\n* The Manchu-led [[Qing dynasty|Great Qing]] (\u5927\u6e05) controlled the north-east area beyond [[Shanhai Pass]], as well as many of the [[Mongol]] tribes.\n* The remnants of the Ming dynasty could only survive south of the [[Huai River]], known retroactively as the Southern Ming.\n\n===Ming loyalist Muslims in the Northwest===\n\nIn 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin (\u7c73\u5587\u5370)<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond the Pass: Economy, Ethnicity, and Empire in Qing Central Asia, 1759\u20131864|first=James

officials quickly agreed that an imperial figure was necessary to rally loyalist support. In early June, a caretaker government led by the Prince of Fu was created.<ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=642}}. The prince was a grandson of the [[Wanli emperor]] (r. 1573\u20131620). Wanli's attempt to name Yousong's father as heir apparent had been thwarted by supporters of the [[Donglin movement]] because Yousong's father was not Wanli's eldest son.

This resulted in rampant corruptions and illegal dealings. Moreover, Ma engaged in intense political bickering with Shi, who was affiliated with the [[Donglin movement]].\n\nIn 1645, [[Zuo Liangyu]], a former warlord and governor of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] for the Hongguang regime, sent his troops towards [[Nanjing]] with the purpose of \"clearing corrupt officials from the emperor's court.\" Seeing that this threat targeted him, Ma declared: \"I and the emperor would rather die at the hand of the Great Qing, we will not die at the hand of Zuo Liangyu.\" By then, the Qing army had begun to move southwards: it had occupied [[Xuzhou]] and was preparing to cross the [[Huai River]]. Ma nonetheless ordered Shi to direct his riverine troops (which were positioned to counter the incoming Qing attack) against Zuo Liangyu.\n\nThis displacement of troops facilitated the Qing capture of Yangzhou. This resulted in the [[Yangzhou massacre]] and the death of Shi in May 1645. It also led directly to the demise of the Nanjing regime. After the Qing armies crossed the [[Yangtze River]] near [[Zhenjiang]] on June 1, the emperor fled Nanjing.

Ports under Zheng Zhilong's control were running out of raw silk due to the Yangzi river delta under attack by the Qing.

Sekisai Ugai said that Zheng Zhilong's brother had 1,000 musket armed Japanese mercenaries. The Tokugawa shogun received two requests for samurai mercenaries and weapons in Nagasaki in 1645-1646 from Zheng Zhilong. The Tokugawa Bakufu originally urged Japanese women who were married to Chinese men to leave Japan when they enacted the maritime ban (after which was passed, they would not be allowed to leave Japan), but many Japanese women who were married to Chinese men like Tagawa Matsu remained in Japan and did not leave when the ban was enacted. The Tokugawa allowed them to stay unlike how they violently ejected the Japanese wives and children of Europeans. After the ban was first passed five years elapsed until Zheng requested his Japanese wife Tagawa be allowed to come to China and they were unsure if they would let her come in violation of the maritime ban. The Tokugawa Shogunate decided to allow Tagawa Matsu, his Japanese wife to violate the ban, leave Japan and reunite with him in China. Zheng Zhilong and one of his underlings, Zhou Ghezhi, both had connections to daimyo and the bakufu after living in Japan. Zhou Hezhi sent a letter on the first request for help and the next one was sent to the Kyoto-based Japanese Emperor and the Edo-based Tokugawa Shogun along with gifts from Zheng Zhilong.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=68\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Portrait of Koxinga.jpg|thumb|Zheng Chenggong, Lord of the Imperial Surname]]\n\nZheng Zhilong informed the Tokugawa Bakufu on how his son Koxinga rose through the ranks of the Ming military and asked for ten slaves and ladies in waiting and Shichizaemon to be allowed to come to China from Japan to help take care of his wife Tagawa Matsu. Although the requests were rejected officially by the bakufu, many Japanese in the Tokugawa government privately supported going to war against the Manchus and support the Ming. Samurai and daimyo were to be subjected to full scale mobilization and attack routes along the coast of China were planned by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was the Qing takeover of Fuzhou in 1646 which caused the plans to be cancelled. Further requests came between 1645-1692. Food and financial shortage led to abandonment of the Jiangxi-Fujian and Zhejiang-Fujian mountain passes by Zheng Zhilong because he could not afford to pay salaries or feed his soldiers all over Fujian. His soldiers were sent to guard the coast. He started negotiations with the Qing and the Shunzhi Emperor officially appointed him as ruler over Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang as \"King of Three Provinces\". However he asked Zhilong to come to Beijing to meet Shunzhi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=69\u2013}}</ref>\n\nZheng Zhilong refused to go because he most likely thought it was a trap. Zheng Zhilong commanded his army not to fight against the Qing as they took over Fuzhou after coming into Fujian in 1646. The Longwu emperor was either killed or escaped and was never again found as he tried to escape to Jiangxi. The Qing invited Zheng Zhilong to a banquet for negotiations. His son Koxinga and brother Zheng Hongkui cried and beseeched Zheng Zhilong not to go. He had 500 war junks and an army which he could still use to rule.

Koxinga's uncles Zheng Zhiwan and Zheng Hongkui pledged allegiance to him and his revenue came from the commercial network of his father Zheng Zhilong. He rallied in Anhai on the coast. Koxinga did not recognize the Prince of Lu as the Emperor and instead continued to use the reign title of the Longwu emperor in contrast to other coastal southeastern warlords. There was hostility between the prince of Lu and Longwu during their reigns and he did not want to have a powerful authority figure with him.

This may have been similar to the Tokugawa bakufu which controlled Japan while the emperor reigned and he was referred to as a feudatory by his followers and himself with the title \"Generalissimo Who Summons and Quells\" which was similar to the \"barbarian-quelling generalissimo\" title of the shogun. The Chinese mufu (tent government) was the model for the bakufu in Japan. Koxinga was an idealist who fought for restoring the Ming before 1651 but the disaster at Xiamen changed his tactics.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA79#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=79\u2013}}</ref> Koxinga's uncles Zheng Hongkui and Zheng Zhiwan had allowed the Qing to attack and pillage Xiamen without a fight after the Qing threatened they would harm Zheng Zhilong and his family who were under house arrest in Beijing. This was directly disobeyed Koxinga's orders, while Koxinga was on his way to help the Yongli emperor. Because the uncles had their own command chain in their armies and they were of the older generation than Koxinga they decided they had the right to violate standing orders Koxinga's men forced him to turn back after they heard what happened to their homes and families in Xiamen so he returned. Zheng Zhiwan and his staff were executed by Koxinga and his own army absorbed Zhiwan's troops. Because Zheng Hongkui sided with Koxinga most of the time and was nice to him before he was not executed but he was scared and went into retirement, giving up control over his troops to Koxinga. He died in 1654 after living on an island for the rest of his life. Shi Lang had warned that Xiamen could be subjected to attack so Shi Lang's arrogance and habit of disobeying orders grew. Koxinga responded by jailing his brother, his father, and him on a ship in 1651 for violating orders. Shi Lang defected to the Qing after breaking out of the ship. Shi Lang's family was then executed by Koxinga. Koxinga then started the build up his organization and strengthening it and going through formal rituals to pay allegiance to the Yongli Emperor.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=81\u2013}}</ref> Koxinga's underlings were people who used to work for his father and his family.

Koxinga, from his [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy) and Xiamen island bases, went on the offensive, killing Zhejiang and Fujiang Qing governor-general Chen Jin, blockading Quanzhou, and taking over most of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou's counties in 1652. He controlled crucial coastal strips and islands on the Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang coast where maritime trade occurred. The Yongli court was earlier regarded as more threatening by the Qing but now their attention was turned to the southeast coast by Koxinga's victories. The Qing were in no way ready to build a navy because of a lack of money and time. The Shunzhi emperor was more open to negotiations after regent Dorgon died in 1652. A ceasefire was issued by Shunzhi in 1653 after negotiations were started.

Koxinga rejected offers by the Qing, saying to his father \"since my father has erred in front, how can I follow your footsteps?\"  The Qing offered him the status of Geng Jimao and Shang Kexi's Guangdong feudatories. He had to pay customs duties to the Qing while maintaining control of his maritime trading organization, the Qing would appoint civil officials in the four prefectures of Huizhou, Chaozhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou which he would take control of while he would still command his army. The Qing ordered him to adopt the queue if he wanted to receive this deal. Adopting the queue could trigger revolt in his army if he conceded. Koxinga rejected the queue order and said that he would accept the same status of Korea, maintaining their hair and clothing and to \"adopt the Qing calendar ... if not for the sake of the land and its mortals, then to bend on behalf of my father.\" if the Qing wanted him to agree to the 4 prefectures deal. Koxinga also said that if the Qing gave him what they offered to his father, total control of Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian, he would agree to adopt the queue.

Koxinga held horseback riding and archery practice for coastal troops and naval practice for inland troops during training when they were not fighting. Confucian education and a stipend were provided for family of officers who died by the \"Hall for Nourishing Descendants\" in Xiamen. Koxinga implemented severe punishments and discipline for disobeying orders and other wrongs, like beatings, poisoning, forced suicide, and decapitation. If one of his underlings won a battle after they were given a suspended death sentence it could be lifted. There were also rewards which led to good battlefield performance.

The violence of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) was dampened by the laws of Tokugawa Japan. A new system of diplomatic relations was implemented by Koxinga with modifications to the tributary system used by Ming China. Japan and other maritime states with relations with Zheng organization were not previously part of the Ming system.  He used \"mutual dispatch of embassies according to a calendar of diplomatic ritual, cordial encounters, and equivalent treatment of these foreign rulers through regulation and practice.\" sizing up relations by power and status. Since the Yongli Emperor was the Zheng's overlord the Zheng organization itself could have equal diplomatic relations unlike the Ming with its tributary system placing itself at the top. Enemy states were treated as vassals as an insult by Koxinga in preparation for war. The Tokugawa Shogun Ietsuna received a diplomatic message of congratulations from Koxinga in 1651. The Zheng organization allied with Shogun Ietsuna. They were familiar with Japanese rules and were a united bloc of Chinese merchants under one leader. They served to balance against the Dutch. The Tokugawa bakufu gave asylum to Ming refugees, and allowed into Nagasaki to trade \"only those Chinese merchants under anti-[Qing] auspices\" after the Manchu invasion since the majority of Japanese were pro-Ming and supported Koxinga. A fake uncle-nephew protocol was used by Ietsuna according to Chinese accounts with Koxinga.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=100\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tokugawa family crest.svg|thumb|right|Tokugawa family crest]]\nXiamen received the money from permits sold in Japan. To make it so he would take most of the trade he sold a maximum annually of 10 new permits. Payment of permits was enforced by Japanese Nagasaki magistrates. Zheng agents received custody of Wang Yunsheng after he tried using a 10 year old expired permit in Nagasaki in 1653. Wang was pardoned by Koxinga after Koxinga's brother Shichizaemon asked him to. The Japanese bakufu helped protect the Zheng network from Dutch violence through its law. Japanese Nagasaki magistrates received cases involving Dutch attacks on Koxinga ships, with Koxinga receiving help from his brother Shichizaemon in filing the cases. At the Malay peninsula around Johor, Chen Zhenguan, a Zheng agent whose junk was headed to Japan, was attacked by several Dutch ships in June 1657. The Dutch were heading for Taiwan with Chen's crew as prisoners but the Dutch ship Urk was blown to Kyushu in Japan by a storm. The Chinese sprang out and filed a case at the magistrates in Nagasaki on 23 August to the bakufu in Edo. They won the case and Japan threatened to kick out the Dutch if they attacked Japan bound junks and forced the Dutch to pay compensation to Chen. 20,000 silver tael payment was ordered by Japan to be paid to Chen by the Dutch in 1661.

In 1646 when Zheng Zhilong first asked for Japanese intervention, the Satsuma and Mito daimyo were the biggest supporters of going to war against the Qing. Zhu Shunshui was asked to get \"troops of any size from the daimyo of Japan.\" by Koxinga as he tried to enlist Japanese to fight in his army.

Koxinga chose [[Nanjing]], which was [[Hongwu]] emperor's choice of a state capital, which would naturally have a large anti-Qing population. [[Nanjing]] was also an important strategic location. On the fifth month and the twelve year of [[Yongli]], Koxinga led an army of 100,000 soldiers and 290 warships to attack [[Nanjing]], leaving a small military force for the defence of [[Xiamen]]\n\nDespite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father succsfully did against the Dutch at the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]], throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Ho |first=Dahpon David |date=2011 |title=Sealords live in vain : Fujian and the making of a maritime frontier in seventeenth-century China |type=A dissertation submitted in partial satisfaction of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy in History  |publisher=UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO  |pages=149-150 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3pk3t096 |access-date=}} </ref> The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yim |first=Lawrence C.H |date=2009 |title=The Poet-historian Qian Qianyi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fI99WIDOVrgC&pg=PA109#v=snippet&q=capital&f=false |publisher=Routledge |page=109 |isbn=1134006063 }}</ref> Koxinga's military force went through [[Zhejiang]], [[Linfen|Pingyang]], [[Ruian]], [[Wenzhou]], and [[Zhoushan]], joining forces with another military commander Zhang Huanyan. On the ninth day of the eight month, near [[Yangsan]] Island a hurricane caused massive damage to the fleet, resulting in the loss of 8,000 personnel, sinking of 40 warships, and various degree of damage to all the ships. Koxinga called a temporary halt to the military advance and ordered repairs and refurbishing of the fleet, waiting for the right moment to attack. The Qing governor called for the strengthening of its defence  surrounding Chongmin Island, Mount Fu, Quanzhou, and Zhengjiang by laying a long iron chain across the river, and building wooden rafts stationed with soldiers and cannons. Koxinga ordered soldiers to cut the iron chain by axes, and to set fire to the enemy's wooden rafts. When Koxinga joined forces with Zhang Huanyan at the [[Yangtze River]], the defending forces' resistance was minimal and soon [[Nanjing]] was encroached.\n\nHowever, he had fallen into the Qing trap and ambush, a number of his generals perished on the battlefield. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements -- though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.  Koxinga's forces were defeated and \"slipped back\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them.  <ref name=\"JR.1985\">{{cite book|author=FREDERIC WAKEMAN JR.|title=The Great Enterprise: The Manchu Reconstruction of Imperial Order in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nXLwSG2O8AC&pg=PA1047#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04804-1|pages=1047\u20131048}}</ref> After suffering a humiliating defeat at Nanjing, Koxinga eventually decided to retreat back to [[Xiamen]]. Chinese historians concluded that the battle of Nanjing was of the utmost importance in the life of Koxinga, since it seriously undermined his grand anti-Qing ambitions.\n\nKoxinga then decided to take Taiwan from the Dutch. He launched the [[Siege of Fort Zeelandia]], defeating the Dutch and driving them out of Taiwan. He then established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] on the site of the former Dutch colony. The Ming dynasty Princes who accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan were the Prince of Ningjing [[Zhu Shugui]] and Prince Zhu H\u00f3nghu\u00e1n [[w:zh:\u6731\u5f18\u6853|\u6731\u5f18\u6853]], son of [[Zhu Yihai]].

Both Japanese and Chinese were found in 1670 on Cheju after their junk got stranded, which was headed to Nagasaki and belonged to the Zheng. Since the Japanese Tokugawa bakufu strictly enforced the closed country policy through using searches and intense scrutiny on ships in Nagasaki, it seems that the Tokugawa Bakufu was allowing Japanese individuals to join the Zheng and fight for them against the Qing. The Tokugawa Bakufu let wandering Japanese fighters join the Zheng to let off steam and avoid them plaguing Japan, they were afraid that daimyo entering the war on the Zheng's side would give them power and at the same time they were worried about fighting face to face against Manchus and there was massive danger involved in engaging in a war on the continent and mobilizing Japan for total war. The anti-Dutch Vietnamese Nguyen lord agreed to trade with Zheng to gain money to fight against the Dutch and their rival Trinh Lords in Tonkin, who were allies of the Dutch. Zheng also traded with the Trinh Lords which helped squeeze the Dutch out.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA106&dq=donning+both+outfits+vessels+searches+goods+prohibitions#v=onepage&q=donning%20both%20outfits%20vessels%20searches%20goods%20prohibitions&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=106\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Qing demanded that Zheng Jing adopt the queue and abandon his island bases in exchange for negotiations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA149&dq=renewed+invitation+talks+authorities+conditions+harsh+ranks+only+evacuated+bases#v=onepage&q=renewed%20invitation%20talks%20authorities%20conditions%20harsh%20ranks%20only%20evacuated%20bases&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=149\u2013}}</ref> Zheng Jing indicated that he wanted to build a new China upon Taiwan and the seas and leave the mainland to the Qing, it was said \"the Great Ming has settled among the waves . . . and administers a separate land from the Qing.\"  by a Zheng merchant Chen De to Korean officials in 1667.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA179&dq=1667+Korean+officials+Chen+de+junk#v=onepage&q=1667%20Korean%20officials%20Chen%20de%20junk&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=179\u2013}}</ref> They were given a feast by the Koreans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA94&dq=1667+Korean+officials+Chen+de+junk#v=onepage&q=korean%20feast%20junk&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=94\u2013}}</ref>\n\nZheng Tai defected to the Qing and started a dispute against Zheng Jing and Shichizaemon over the Nagasaki Chinese Interpreter's Office silver deposit of 3000,000 taels.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA155#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=154\u2013155}}</ref> During the revolt of the three feudatories, Zheng Jing launched a new offensive against the Qing and retook land in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA204#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=203\u2013}}</ref> Zheng Tai's relatives in Beijing re-defected to Zheng Jing's side and after Zheng Jing restarted his anti-Qing activities, the Tokugawa renewed trade and solved the silver dispute between Zheng Tai and Zheng Jing, handing over the silver to Zheng Jing.

Ming loyalists fled to [[Nanjing]], where they enthroned [[Zhu Yousong]] as the Hongguang Emperor, marking the start of the Southern Ming. The Nanjing regime lasted until 1645, when Qing forces captured Nanjing. Later, a series of pretenders held court in various southern Chinese cities.<ref>See ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&pg= The Oxford History of Historical Writing: 1400\u20131800]'' (2011) by Jose Rabasa, p. 37.</ref>\n\nThe Nanjing regime lacked the resources to pay and supply its soldiers, who were left to live off the land and pillaged the countryside.<ref>It was projected that 7 million [[tael]]s would be required to fund military activity alone. Revenue of 6 million taels was anticipated based on normal receipts from the areas under Nanjing's control. Severe drought, rebellion, and unsettled conditions combined to ensure that actual revenue was only a fraction of this amount. (''The Cambridge History of China: The Ming Dynasty, 1368\u20131644'', pt. 1, p. 645).</ref> The soldiers' behavior was so notorious that they were refused entry by those cities in a position to do so.<ref>Wakeman, Volume 1, p. 354.</ref> Court official [[Shi Kefa]] obtained modern [[cannon]]s and organized resistance at [[Yangzhou]]. The cannons mowed down a large number of Qing soldiers, but this only enraged those who survived. After the Yangzhou city fell in May 1645, the Manchus started a general massacre pillage and enslaved all the women and children in the notorious [[Yangzhou massacre]]. Nanjing captured promptly by Qing on June 6 and the Prince of Fu was taken to Beijing and executed in 1646.\n\nThe literati in the provinces responded to the news from Yangzhou and Nanjing with an outpouring of emotion. Some recruited their own militia and became resistance leaders. Shi was lionized and there was a wave of hopeless sacrifice by loyalists who vowed to erase the shame of Nanjing. By late 1646, the heroics had petered out and the Qing advance had resumed. Notable Ming pretenders held court in [[Fuzhou]] (1645\u20131646), [[Guangzhou]] (1646\u20131647), and [[Anlong]] (1652\u20131659). The [[Zhu Shugui|Prince of Ningjing]] maintained a palace in the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] (based in modern-day [[Tainan]], [[Taiwan]]) until 1683.\n\nThe end of the Ming and the subsequent Nanjing regime are depicted in ''[[Peach Blossom Fan]]'', a classic of [[Chinese literature]]. The upheaval of this period, sometimes referred to as the [[Transition from Ming to Qing|Ming\u2013Qing cataclysm]], has been linked{{Citation needed|reason=Little ice age makes no mention of this incident and timeframe does not line up|date=March 2020}} to a decline in [[global temperature]] known as the [[Little Ice Age]]. With agriculture devastated by a severe drought, there was manpower available for numerous rebel armies.\n\n==Background==\nThe fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] conquest that followed was a period of catastrophic war and population decline in China, comparable to Europe's [[Thirty Years War]] (1618\u20131648). China experienced a period of extremely cold weather from the 1620s until the 1710s.<ref>\"[http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2010/06/30/china%E2%80%99s-2000-year-temperature-history/ China\u2019s 2,000 Year Temperature History]\"</ref> Some modern scholars link the worldwide drop in temperature at this time to the [[Maunder Minimum]], an extended period from 1645 to 1715 when sunspots were absent.<ref>Eddy, John A., \"The Maunder Minimum: Sunspots and Climate in the Age of Louis XIV\", ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KS6EAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]'' edited by Geoffrey Parker, Lesley M. Smith.</ref> Whatever the cause, the change in the climate reduced agricultural yields and cut state revenue. It also led to drought, which displaced many peasants. There were a series of peasant revolts in the late Ming, culminating in a revolt led by [[Li Zicheng]] which overthrew the dynasty in 1644.\n\nMing ideology emphasized authoritarian and centralized administration, referred to as \"imperial supremacy\" or ''hu\u00e1ngj\u00ed''. However, comprehensive central decision-making was beyond the technology of the time.<ref>\"Government finance under the Ming represented an attempt to impose and extremely ambitious centralized system on an enormous empire before its level of technology had made such a degree of centralization practical.\" Ray Huang, ''Taxation and Finance in Sixteenth-Century Ming China'', p. 313.</ref> The principle of uniformity meant that the lowest common denominator was often selected as the standard. The need to implement change on an empire-wide basis complicated any effort to reform the system, leaving administrators helpless to respond in an age of upheaval.\n\nCivil servants were selected by an arduous examination system which tested knowledge of classic literature. While they might be adapt at citing precedents from the [[Zhou dynasty]] of righteous and unrighteous behavior, they were rarely as knowledgeable when it came to contemporary economic, social, or military matters. Unlike previous dynasties, the Ming had no prime minister. So when a young ruler retreated to the inner court to enjoy the company of his concubines, power devolved to the eunuchs.<ref>Tong, James, ''Disorder Under Heaven: Collective Violence in the Ming Dynasty'' (1991), p. 112.</ref> Only the eunuchs had access to the inner court, but the eunuch cliques were distrusted by the officials who were expected to carry out the emperor's decrees. Officials educated at the [[Donglin Academy]] were known for accusing the eunuchs and others of a lack of righteousness.\n\nOn April 24, 1644, Li's soldiers breached the walls of the Ming capital [[Beijing]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide the next day to avoid humiliation at their hands. Remnants of the [[House of Zhu|Ming imperial family]] and some court ministers then sought refuge in the southern part of China and regrouped around [[Nanjing]], the Ming auxiliary capital, south of the [[Yangtze River]]. Four different power groups thus emerged:\n* The [[Shun dynasty|Great Shun]] (\u5927\u9806), led by Li Zicheng, ruled north of the [[Huai River|Huai river]].\n* [[Zhang Xianzhong]]'s Great Xi (\u5927\u897f) controlled [[Sichuan]] province.\n* The Manchu-led [[Qing dynasty|Great Qing]] (\u5927\u6e05) controlled the north-east area beyond [[Shanhai Pass]], as well as many of the [[Mongol]] tribes.\n* The remnants of the Ming dynasty could only survive south of the [[Huai River]], known retroactively as the Southern Ming.\n\n===Ming loyalist Muslims in the Northwest===\n\nIn 1644, Muslim

officials quickly agreed that an imperial figure was necessary to rally loyalist support. In early June, a caretaker government led by the Prince of Fu was created.<ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=642}}. The prince was a grandson of the [[Wanli emperor]] (r. 1573\u20131620). Wanli's attempt to name Yousong's father as heir apparent had been thwarted by supporters of the [[Donglin movement]] because Yousong's father was not Wanli's eldest son. Although this was three generations earlier, Donglin officials in Nanjing nonetheless feared that the prince might retaliate against them.</ref> By the time he arrived in the vicinity of Nanjing, the prince could already count on the support of both [[Ma Shiying]] and Shi Kefa.<ref name=\"Struve 642\">{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=642}}.</ref> He entered the city on June 5 and accepted the title \"protector of the state\" the next day.<ref>{{harvnb|Hucker|1985|p=149}} (item 840).</ref> Prodded by some court officials, the Prince of Fu immediately begin to consider ascending the throne.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 345 and 346, note 86.</ref> The prince had a problematic reputation in terms of Confucian morality, so some members of the Donglin faction suggested the Prince of Lu as an alternative. Other officials noted that the Prince of Fu, as next in line by blood, was clearly the safer choice. In any case, the so-called \"righteousness\" faction was not keen to risk a confrontation with Ma, who arrived in Nanjing with a large fleet on June 17.<ref name=\"Wakeman 346\">{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=346}}.</ref> The Prince of Fu was crowned as the Hongguang emperor on June 19.<ref name=\"Wakeman 346\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=644}}.</ref> It was decided that the next lunar year would be the first year of the Hongguang reign.\n\nThe Hongguang court proclaimed that its goal was \"to ally with the Tartars to pacify the bandits,\" that is, to seek cooperation with Qing military forces in order to annihilate rebel peasant militia led by [[Li Zicheng]] and [[Zhang Xianzhong]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pp=396 and 404}}.</ref>\n\nBecause Ma was the emperor's main supporter, he started to monopolize the royal court's administration by reviving the functions of the remaining eunuchs. This resulted in rampant corruptions and illegal dealings. Moreover, Ma engaged in intense political bickering with Shi, who was affiliated with the [[Donglin movement]].\n\nIn 1645, [[Zuo Liangyu]], a former warlord and governor of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] for the Hongguang regime, sent his troops towards [[Nanjing]] with the purpose of \"clearing corrupt officials from the emperor's court.\" Seeing that this threat targeted him, Ma declared: \"I and the emperor would rather die at the hand of the Great Qing, we will not die at the hand of Zuo Liangyu.\" By then, the Qing army had begun to move southwards: it had occupied [[Xuzhou]] and was preparing to cross the [[Huai River]]. Ma nonetheless ordered Shi to direct his riverine troops (which were positioned to counter the incoming Qing attack) against Zuo Liangyu.\n\nThis displacement of troops facilitated the Qing capture of Yangzhou. This resulted in the [[Yangzhou massacre]] and the death of Shi in May 1645. It also led directly to the demise of the Nanjing regime. After the Qing armies crossed the [[Yangtze River]] near [[Zhenjiang]] on June 1, the emperor fled Nanjing. Qing armies led by the Manchu prince [[Dodo (prince)|Dodo]] immediately moved toward Nanjing, which surrendered without a fight on June 8, 1645.<ref>{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=578}}.</ref> A detachment of Qing soldiers then captured the fleeing emperor on June 15, and he was brought back to Nanjing on June 18.<ref name=\"Wakeman 580\">{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=580}}.</ref> The fallen emperor was later transported to Beijing, where he died the following year.<ref name=\"Wakeman 580\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Kennedy|1943|p=196}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Mingshi|official history]], written under Qing sponsorship in the eighteenth century, blames Ma's lack of foresight, his hunger for power and money, and his thirst for private revenge for the fall of the Nanjing court.\n\n[[Zhu Changfang, Prince of Lu]], declared himself regent in 1645, but surrendered the next year.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Dillon |first1=Michael |title=Encyclopedia of Chinese History |date=2016 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=1317817168 |page=645}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Fuzhou}}\n\n==The Fuzhou court (1645\u20131646)==\n{{main article|Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang}}\n{{main article|Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu}}\n{{see also|Zhu Hengjia}}\n[[File:Long-wu.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of the Prince of Tang, who reigned as the  Longwu emperor from August 1645 to October 1646.]]\nIn 1644, [[Zhu Yujian]] was a ninth-generation descendant of [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] who had been put under house arrest in 1636 by the Chongzhen emperor.

Ports under Zheng Zhilong's control were running out of raw silk due to the Yangzi river delta under attack by the Qing. The Longwu emperor wanted the take over Huguang and Jiangxi provinces which were major producers of rice to help boost the southern Ming.

Sekisai Ugai said that Zheng Zhilong's brother had 1,000 musket armed Japanese mercenaries. The Tokugawa shogun received two requests for samurai mercenaries and weapons in Nagasaki in 1645-1646 from Zheng Zhilong. The Tokugawa Bakufu originally urged Japanese women who were married to Chinese men to leave Japan when they enacted the maritime ban (after which was passed, they would not be allowed to leave Japan), but many Japanese women who were married to Chinese men like Tagawa Matsu remained in Japan and did not leave when the ban was enacted. The Tokugawa allowed them to stay unlike how they violently ejected the Japanese wives and children of Europeans. After the ban was first passed five years elapsed until Zheng requested his Japanese wife Tagawa be allowed to come to China and they were unsure if they would let her come in violation of the maritime ban. The Tokugawa Shogunate decided to allow Tagawa Matsu, his Japanese wife to violate the ban, leave Japan and reunite with him in China. Zheng Zhilong and one of his underlings, Zhou Ghezhi, both had connections to daimyo and the bakufu after living in Japan. Zhou Hezhi sent a letter on the first request for help and the next one was sent to the Kyoto-based Japanese Emperor and the Edo-based Tokugawa Shogun along with gifts from Zheng Zhilong.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tQ10CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=68\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Portrait of Koxinga.jpg|thumb|Zheng Chenggong, Lord of the Imperial Surname]]\n\nZheng Zhilong informed the Tokugawa Bakufu on how his son Koxinga rose through the ranks of the Ming military and asked for ten slaves and ladies in waiting and Shichizaemon to be allowed to come to China from Japan to help take care of his wife Tagawa Matsu. Although the requests were rejected officially by the bakufu, many Japanese in the Tokugawa government privately supported going to war against the Manchus and support the Ming. Samurai and daimyo were to be subjected to full scale mobilization and attack routes along the coast of China were planned by the Tokugawa shogunate. It was the Qing takeover of Fuzhou in 1646 which caused the plans to be cancelled. Further requests came between 1645-1692. Food and financial shortage led to abandonment of the Jiangxi-Fujian and Zhejiang-Fujian mountain passes by Zheng Zhilong because he could not afford to pay salaries or feed his soldiers all over Fujian. His soldiers were sent to guard the coast. He started negotiations with the Qing and the Shunzhi Emperor officially appointed him as ruler over Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang as \"King of Three Provinces\". However he asked Zhilong to come to Beijing to meet Shunzhi.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=69\u2013}}</ref>\n\nZheng Zhilong refused to go because he most likely thought it was a trap. Zheng Zhilong commanded his army not to fight against the Qing as they took over Fuzhou after coming into Fujian in 1646. The Longwu emperor was either killed or escaped and was never again found as he tried to escape to Jiangxi. The Qing invited Zheng Zhilong to a banquet for negotiations. His son Koxinga and brother Zheng Hongkui cried and beseeched Zheng Zhilong not to go. He had 500 war junks and an army which he could still use to rule.

Koxinga referred to the queue order, saying \"no person, wise or stupid, is willing to become a slave with a head that looks like a fly\" and he wanted revenge against the Qing for the death of his mother. Koxinga was conflicted by filial piety and loyalty but never allowed himself to be used and used others. He gained control over thousands of men after originally having only 300. Koxinga's uncles Zheng Zhiwan and Zheng Hongkui pledged allegiance to him and his revenue came from the commercial network of his father Zheng Zhilong. He rallied in Anhai on the coast. Koxinga did not recognize the Prince of Lu as the Emperor and instead continued to use the reign title of the Longwu emperor in contrast to other coastal southeastern warlords. There was hostility between the prince of Lu and Longwu during their reigns and he did not want to have a powerful authority figure with him.

This may have been similar to the Tokugawa bakufu which controlled Japan while the emperor reigned and he was referred to as a feudatory by his followers and himself with the title \"Generalissimo Who Summons and Quells\" which was similar to the \"barbarian-quelling generalissimo\" title of the shogun. The Chinese mufu (tent government) was the model for the bakufu in Japan.

This was directly disobeyed Koxinga's orders, while Koxinga was on his way to help the Yongli emperor. Because the uncles had their own command chain in their armies and they were of the older generation than Koxinga they decided they had the right to violate standing orders Koxinga's men forced him to turn back after they heard what happened to their homes and families in Xiamen so he returned. Zheng Zhiwan and his staff were executed by Koxinga and his own army absorbed Zhiwan's troops. Because Zheng Hongkui sided with Koxinga most of the time and was nice to him before he was not executed but he was scared and went into retirement, giving up control over his troops to Koxinga. He died in 1654 after living on an island for the rest of his life. Shi Lang had warned that Xiamen could be subjected to attack so Shi Lang's arrogance and habit of disobeying orders grew. Koxinga responded by jailing his brother, his father, and him on a ship in 1651 for violating orders. Shi Lang defected to the Qing after breaking out of the ship. Shi Lang's family was then executed by Koxinga.

Wang Zhongxiao and Li Maochun, who were gentry of Minnan, and Xu Fuyuan, a bureaucrat in the Ming government were among the number of people in Koxinga's organization.

In 1652 the Prince of Lu gave up his titles under Koxinga's pressure. Koxinga sent him to Penghu and did not reinstate his titles in 1659 when the Yongli emperor ordered that they be. The Tingzhou Hakka Liu Guoxuan, former Zhangzhou vice-garrison commander for the Qing, and the former Taizhou military commander for the Qing, northern Chinese Ma Xin (\u99ac\u4fe1) defected to Koxinga's side.

Koxinga, from his [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy) and Xiamen island bases, went on the offensive, killing Zhejiang and Fujiang Qing governor-general Chen Jin, blockading Quanzhou, and taking over most of Quanzhou and Zhangzhou's counties in 1652. He controlled crucial coastal strips and islands on the Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang coast where maritime trade occurred. The Yongli court was earlier regarded as more threatening by the Qing but now their attention was turned to the southeast coast by Koxinga's victories. The Qing were in no way ready to build a navy because of a lack of money and time. The Shunzhi emperor was more open to negotiations after regent Dorgon died in 1652. A ceasefire was issued by Shunzhi in 1653 after negotiations were started.

Koxinga rejected offers by the Qing, saying to his father \"since my father has erred in front, how can I follow your footsteps?\"  The Qing offered him the status of Geng Jimao and Shang Kexi's Guangdong feudatories. He had to pay customs duties to the Qing while maintaining control of his maritime trading organization, the Qing would appoint civil officials in the four prefectures of Huizhou, Chaozhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou which he would take control of while he would still command his army. The Qing ordered him to adopt the queue if he wanted to receive this deal. Adopting the queue could trigger revolt in his army if he conceded. Koxinga rejected the queue order and said that he would accept the same status of Korea, maintaining their hair and clothing and to \"adopt the Qing calendar ... if not for the sake of the land and its mortals, then to bend on behalf of my father.\" if the Qing wanted him to agree to the 4 prefectures deal.

Koxinga held horseback riding and archery practice for coastal troops and naval practice for inland troops during training when they were not fighting. Confucian education and a stipend were provided for family of officers who died by the \"Hall for Nourishing Descendants\" in Xiamen. Koxinga implemented severe punishments and discipline for disobeying orders and other wrongs, like beatings, poisoning, forced suicide, and decapitation. If one of his underlings won a battle after they were given a suspended death sentence it could be lifted. There were also rewards which led to good battlefield performance. There was a dearth of food supply. Families of gentry, Ming princes, soldiers, and officers not engaged in work numbered 300,000 which he had to support with food. 1,500 soldiers in one southern Fujian town put a strain on food supply.

The violence of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) was dampened by the laws of Tokugawa Japan. A new system of diplomatic relations was implemented by Koxinga with modifications to the tributary system used by Ming China. Japan and other maritime states with relations with Zheng organization were not previously part of the Ming system.  He used \"mutual dispatch of embassies according to a calendar of diplomatic ritual, cordial encounters, and equivalent treatment of these foreign rulers through regulation and practice.\" sizing up relations by power and status. Since the Yongli Emperor was the Zheng's overlord the Zheng organization itself could have equal diplomatic relations unlike the Ming with its tributary system placing itself at the top. Enemy states were treated as vassals as an insult by Koxinga in preparation for war. The Tokugawa Shogun Ietsuna received a diplomatic message of congratulations from Koxinga in 1651. The Zheng organization allied with Shogun Ietsuna. They were familiar with Japanese rules and were a united bloc of Chinese merchants under one leader. They served to balance against the Dutch. The Tokugawa bakufu gave asylum to Ming refugees, and allowed into Nagasaki to trade \"only those Chinese merchants under anti-[Qing] auspices\" after the Manchu invasion since the majority of Japanese were pro-Ming and supported Koxinga. A fake uncle-nephew protocol was used by Ietsuna according to Chinese accounts with Koxinga.<ref>{{cite book|author=Xing Hang|title=Conflict and Commerce in Maritime East Asia: The Zheng Family and the Shaping of the Modern World, c.1620\u20131720|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcMwCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA100#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=5 January 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-12184-3|pages=100\u2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Tokugawa family crest.svg|thumb|right|Tokugawa family crest]]\nXiamen received the money from permits sold in Japan. To make it so he would take most of the trade he sold a maximum annually of 10 new permits. Payment of permits was enforced by Japanese Nagasaki magistrates. Zheng agents received custody of Wang Yunsheng after he tried using a 10 year old expired permit in Nagasaki in 1653. Wang was pardoned by Koxinga after Koxinga's brother Shichizaemon asked him to. The Japanese bakufu helped protect the Zheng network from Dutch violence through its law. Japanese Nagasaki magistrates received cases involving Dutch attacks on Koxinga ships, with Koxinga receiving help from his brother Shichizaemon in filing the cases. At the Malay peninsula around Johor, Chen Zhenguan, a Zheng agent whose junk was headed to Japan, was attacked by several Dutch ships in June 1657. The Dutch were heading for Taiwan with Chen's crew as prisoners but the Dutch ship Urk was blown to Kyushu in Japan by a storm. The Chinese sprang out and filed a case at the magistrates in Nagasaki on 23 August to the bakufu in Edo.

The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do.

On the ninth day of the eight month, near [[Yangsan]] Island a hurricane caused massive damage to the fleet, resulting in the loss of 8,000 personnel, sinking of 40 warships, and various degree of damage to all the ships. Koxinga called a temporary halt to the military advance and ordered repairs and refurbishing of the fleet, waiting for the right moment to attack. The Qing governor called for the strengthening of its defence  surrounding Chongmin Island, Mount Fu, Quanzhou, and Zhengjiang by laying a long iron chain across the river, and building wooden rafts stationed with soldiers and cannons. Koxinga ordered soldiers to cut the iron chain by axes, and to set fire to the enemy's wooden rafts. When Koxinga joined forces with Zhang Huanyan at the [[Yangtze River]], the defending forces' resistance was minimal and soon [[Nanjing]] was encroached.\n\nHowever, he had fallen into the Qing trap and ambush, a number of his generals perished on the battlefield. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing.  The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24.  Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements -- though cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived.

Both Japanese and Chinese were found in 1670 on Cheju after their junk got stranded, which was headed to Nagasaki and belonged to the Zheng. Since the Japanese Tokugawa bakufu strictly enforced the closed country policy through using searches and intense scrutiny on ships in Nagasaki, it seems that the Tokugawa Bakufu was allowing Japanese individuals to join the Zheng and fight for them against the Qing. The Tokugawa Bakufu let wandering Japanese fighters join the Zheng to let off steam and avoid them plaguing Japan, they were afraid that daimyo entering the war on the Zheng's side would give them power and at the same time they were worried about fighting face to face against Manchus and there was massive danger involved in engaging in a war on the continent and mobilizing Japan for total war.

Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

The particle prefix ''me(n)t-'' from the verb <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u03ef}}</big> ''moudi'' ('to speak') forms many abstract nouns in Coptic (not only those pertaining to \"language\"). The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}.

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |title=Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] |first= |date=September 2006 |publisher=KONDA |page=19 |format=PDF |chapter=Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue]}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sijpesteijn |first=Petra |title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt |last2=Lennart Sundelin |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13886-5 |location=Leiden, Boston}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward.

It's difficult to explain <\u03b7>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.\n\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic.

A possible shift from a tenuis-aspirate distinction to voiced-tenuis is only attested from the alveolars, the only place that Arabic has such a contrast.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|+ Late Coptic consonants\n|-\n!

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Proclitic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |As suffix\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n!

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb.

However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{Cite journal |last=Abel |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Abel |year=1855 |title=On the Coptic Language |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61 |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |issue=5 |ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".

Coptic flourished as a [[literary language]] from the 2nd to 13th centuries and its Bohairic dialect continues to be the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].

The term ''rem\u0259nk\u02b0\u0113mi/r\u0259m\u0259nk\u0113me'' meaning 'Egyptian', literally 'person of Egypt', is a compound of ''rem-'', which is the [[construct state]] of the Coptic noun <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big>, 'man, human being', + the genitive preposition <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''(\u0259)n-'' 'of' + the word for 'Egypt', <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big>/<big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi/k\u0113me'' (cf.

The language is spoken only in Egypt and historically has had little influence outside of the territory, except for monasteries located in [[Nubia]]. Coptic's most noticeable linguistic impact has been on the various dialects of [[Egyptian Arabic]], which is characterised by a Coptic [[stratum (linguistics)#Substratum|substratum]] in [[lexicon|lexical]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[syntax|syntactical]], and [[phonology|phonological]] features.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Influence on other languages ===\nIn addition to influencing the grammar, vocabulary and syntax of Egyptian Arabic, Coptic has lent to both [[Arabic]] and [[Modern Hebrew]] such words as:\n\n* ''tims\u0101\u1e25'', {{lang-ar|\u062a\u0645\u0633\u0627\u062d}}, {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05de\u05e1\u05d7}} \"crocodile\"; <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|emsah}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|timsah}}.

Hence it is unclear why the word should have entered Arabic with an initial ''t'', which would have required the word to be grammatically feminine (i.e. Sahidic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u2ca7\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>; Bohairic: <big>{{Coptic|*\u03ef\u2c89\u2c99\u2ca5\u2c81\u03e9}}</big>).\n* ''\u1e6d\u016bbah'' {{lang|ar|\u0637\u0648\u0628\u0629}} \"brick\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014d\u014dbe}}; Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2c83\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|t\u014dbi}}; this subsequently entered [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (via [[Andalusian Arabic]]) as {{lang|ca|tova}} and {{lang|es|[[adobe]]}} respectively, the latter of which was borrowed by [[American English]].\n* ''w\u0101\u1e25ah'' {{lang|ar|\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0629}} \"oasis\"; Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c81\u03e9\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouahe}}, Bohairic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c89\u03e9\u2c93}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|ouehi}}; this subsequently entered Turkish as {{lang|tr|vaha}}\n\nA few words of Coptic origin are found in the [[Greek language]]; some of the words were later lent to various European languages\u2009\u2014\u2009such as ''[[barge]]'', from Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89}}</big> {{lang|cop-Latn|baare}}, \"small boat\".\n\nHowever, most words of Egyptian origin that entered into Greek and subsequently into other European languages came directly from Ancient Egyptian, often [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]].

Coptic belongs to the Later Egyptian phase, which started to be written in the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]]. Later Egyptian represented colloquial speech of the later periods. It had analytic features like definite and [[indefinite article]]s and [[periphrasis|periphrastic]] verb conjugation. Coptic, therefore, is a reference to both the most recent stage of Egyptian after [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] and the new writing system that was adapted from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n=== Pre-Islamic period ===\nThe earliest attempts to write the Egyptian language using the Greek alphabet are Greek transcriptions of Egyptian proper names, most of which date to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]]. Scholars frequently refer to this phase as pre-Coptic. However, it is clear that by the [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]], demotic scribes regularly employed a more phonetic orthography, a testament to the increasing cultural contact between [[Egyptians]] and [[Greeks]] even before [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest of Egypt. Coptic itself, or Old Coptic, takes root in the first century. The transition from the older Egyptian scripts to the newly adapted Coptic alphabet was in part due to the decline of the traditional role played by the priestly class of [[ancient Egyptian religion]], who unlike most ordinary Egyptians, were literate in the temple scriptoria. Old Coptic is represented mostly by non-Christian texts such as Egyptian pagan prayers and magical and [[astrological papyri]]. Many of them served as [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to original [[hieratic]] and demotic equivalents. The glosses may have been aimed at non-Egyptian speakers.\n[[File:coptic luke.jpg|right|thumb|Eighth century Coptic manuscript of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 5.5\u20139]] Under late [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman rule]], [[Diocletian]] persecuted many Egyptian converts to the new [[Christianity|Christian faith]], which forced new converts to flee to the Egyptian deserts. In time, the growth of these communities generated the need to write Christian Greek instructions in the Egyptian language. The early Fathers of the [[Coptic Church]], such as [[Anthony the Great]], [[Pachomius the Great]], [[Macarius of Egypt]] and [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], who otherwise usually wrote in Greek, addressed some of their works to the Egyptian monks in Egyptian. The Egyptian language, now written in the Coptic alphabet, flourished in the second and third centuries. However, it was not until [[Shenoute]] that Coptic became a fully standardised literary language based on the Sahidic dialect. Shenouda's native Egyptian tongue and knowledge of Greek and rhetoric gave him the necessary tools to elevate Coptic, in content and style, to a literary height nearly equal to the position of the Egyptian language in ancient Egypt.\n\n=== Islamic period ===\n[[File:Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar.png|thumb|Page from 19th century Coptic Language Grammar]]\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] by [[Arabs]] came with the [[spread of Islam]] in the seventh century. At the turn of the eighth century, [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] decreed{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} that Arabic replace [[Koine Greek]] and Coptic as the sole [[administrative language]]. Literary Coptic gradually declined, and within a few hundred years, Egyptian bishop [[Severus Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf]] found it necessary to write his ''History of the Patriarchs'' in Arabic. However, ecclesiastically the language retained an important position, and many [[hagiography|hagiographic]] texts were also composed during this period. Until the 10th century, Coptic remained the spoken language of the native population outside the capital.\n\nCoptic is thought to have completely given way to [[Egyptian Arabic]] around the 13th century,<ref>https://journals.openedition.org/ema/1920</ref> though it may have survived in isolated pockets for a little longer. In the second half of the 19th century, [[Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria]] started a national Church-sponsored movement to revive Coptic. Several works of grammar were published, including a more comprehensive dictionary than had been formerly available. The scholarly findings of the field of [[Egyptology]] and the inauguration of the [[Institute of Coptic Studies]] further contributed to the renaissance. Efforts at language revitalisation continue to be undertaken, both inside and [[Liberal Egyptian Party|outside the Church]], and have attracted the interest of [[Copts]] and linguists in and outside of Egypt.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} In a 2016 research in Turkey by [[KONDA Research and Consultancy]], 0.01% of respondents claimed their native language to be Coptic (possibly confusing the words \"kipt\u0131ce\" (Coptic language) and \"kip\u00e7ak\" ([[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]]).<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://www.konda.com.tr/tr/raporlar/2006_09_KONDA_Toplumsal_Yapi.pdf |title=Toplumsal Yap\u0131 Ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 2006 [Social Structure Research 2006] |first=--> |date=September 2006 |publisher=KONDA |page=19 |format=PDF |chapter=Etnik Kimlikler: Anadil [Ethnic Identitites: Mother Tongue]}}</ref>\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{main|Coptic alphabet}}\n[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|Stone with Coptic inscription]]\n\nCoptic uses a writing system almost wholly derived from the [[Greek alphabet]], with the addition of a number of letters that have their origins in [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic Egyptian]]. This is comparable to the Latin-based [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic alphabet]], which includes the runic letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]].<ref>http://www.suscopts.org/deacons/coptic/coptic_alphabet.pdf</ref> There is some variation in the number and forms of these signs depending on the dialect. Some of the letters in the Coptic alphabet that are of Greek origin were normally reserved for words that are themselves Greek. Old Coptic texts employed several graphemes that were not retained in the literary Coptic orthography of later centuries.\n\nIn Sahidic, [[syllable]] boundary may have been marked by a supralinear stroke, or the stroke may have tied letters together in one word, since Coptic texts did not otherwise indicate word divisions. Some scribal traditions use a [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] over {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} at the beginning of a syllable or to mark a diphthong. Bohairic uses a superposed point or small stroke known as a ''djinkim''.\n\n== Literature ==\n{{Main|Coptic literature}}\nThe oldest Coptic writings date to the pre-Christian era (Old Coptic), though Coptic literature consists mostly of texts written by prominent saints of the Coptic Church such as Anthony the Great, Pachomius the Great and Shenoute. Shenoute helped fully standardise the Coptic language through his many sermons, treatises and homilies, which formed the basis of early Coptic literature.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe core [[lexicon]] of Coptic is [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], most closely related to the preceding [[Demotic (Egyptian)|Demotic]] phase of the language. Up to 40% of the vocabulary of literary Coptic is drawn from [[Greek language|Greek]], but borrowings are not always fully adapted to the Coptic phonological system and may have [[Semantics|semantic]] differences as well. There are instances of Coptic texts having passages that are almost entirely composed from Greek lexical roots. However, that is likely due to the fact that the majority of Coptic religious texts are direct translations of Greek works.\n\n{{quote|What invariably attracts the attention of the reader of a Coptic text, especially if it is written in the Sa'idic dialect, is the very liberal use which is made of Greek loan words, of which so few, indeed, are to be found in the Ancient Egyptian language. There Greek loan words occur everywhere in Coptic literature, be it Biblical, liturgical, theological, or non-literary, i.e. legal documents and personal letters. Though nouns and verbs predominate, the Greek loan words may come from any other part of speech except pronouns\u2019<ref>Girgis, WA (1963\u201364). Greek loan words in Coptic. ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019arch\u00e9ologie copte'' 17:63\u201373.</ref>}}\n\nWords or concepts for which no adequate Egyptian translation existed were taken directly from Greek to avoid altering the meaning of the religious message. In addition, other Egyptian words that would have adequately translated the Greek equivalents were not employed as they were perceived as having overt pagan associations. Old Coptic texts employ many such words, phrases and [[epithet]]s; for example, the word {{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c83\u2c81\u2c93\u2ca7\u2cb1\u2ca9}} '(Who is) in (His) Mountain', is an epithet of [[Anubis]].<ref>Gignac, Francis Thomas, p. 174</ref> There are also traces of some archaic grammatical features, such as residues of the Demotic [[relative clause]], lack of an indefinite article and possessive use of suffixes.\n\nThus, the transition from the 'old' traditions to the new Christian religion also contributed to the adoption of Greek words into the Coptic religious lexicon. It is safe to assume that the everyday speech of the native population retained, to a greater extent, its indigenous Egyptian character, which is sometimes reflected in Coptic nonreligious documents such as letters and contracts.\n\n== Phonology ==\nCoptic provides the clearest indication of Later Egyptian [[phonology]] from its writing system, which fully indicates vowel sounds and occasionally stress pattern. The phonological system of Later Egyptian is also better known than that of the Classical phase of the language because of a greater number of sources indicating Egyptian sounds, including [[Amarna letters|cuneiform letters]] containing transcriptions of Egyptian words and phrases, and Egyptian renderings of [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] names. Coptic sounds, in addition, are known from a variety of Coptic-Arabic papyri in which Arabic letters were used to transcribe Coptic and vice versa. They date to the medieval Islamic period, when Coptic was still spoken.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sijpesteijn |first=Petra |title=Papyrology and the History of Early Islamic Egypt |last2=Lennart Sundelin |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |year=2004 |isbn=978-90-04-13886-5 |location=Leiden, Boston}}</ref>\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThere are some differences of opinion among Coptic language scholars on the correct phonetic interpretation of the writing system of Coptic. Differences centre on how to interpret the pairs of letters \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9. In Greek spelling, the first member of each pair is a short closed vowel {{IPA|/e, o/}}, and the second member is a long open vowel {{IPA|/\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0/}}. In some interpretations of Coptic phonology,{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} it is assumed that the length difference is primary, with \u03b5/\u03b7 {{IPA|e/e\u02d0}} and \u03bf/\u03c9 is {{IPA|o/o\u02d0}}. Other scholars<ref>Greenberg 1962/1990</ref>{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|pp=xii-ix}} argue for a different analysis in which \u03b5/\u03b7 and \u03bf/\u03c9 are interpreted as {{IPA|e/\u025b}} and {{IPA|o/\u0254}}.\n\nThese two charts show the two theories of Coptic vowel phonology:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+'''[[Monophthong]] phonemes (length theory)'''\n!\n!

Evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate that these are distinct vowels, and if they are, the difference has a very low [[functional load]]. For dialects that use orthographic <\u03b5\u03b9> for a single vowel, there appears to be no phonetic difference from <\u03b9>.\n\nDouble orthographic vowels are presumed here to be long, as that makes the morphology more straightforward.

It's possible there was also a distinction between short {{IPA|/\u025b/}} and {{IPA|/a/}}, but if so the functional load was extremely low.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+Sahidic stressed vowels\n!\n!

It's difficult to explain <\u03b7>. However, it generally became /a/ in stressed monosyllables, /i/ in unstressed monosyllables, and in polysyllables, /a/ when followed by /i/, and /i/ when not.\n\nThere were no doubled orthographic vowels in Mesokemic. Some representative correspondences with Sahidic are,\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Sahidic stressed vowels\n|\u03b1||\u03b1\u03b1, \u03b5\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03bf||\u03c9||\u03c9\u03c9\n|-\n!Mesokemic equivalent\n|\u03b5||\u03b7||\u03b7||\u03b1||\u03bf||\u03c9\n|}\n\nIt's not clear if these correspondences reflect distinct pronunciations in Mesokemic, or if they're an imitation of the long Greek vowels <\u03b7, \u03c9>.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nAs with the vowels, there are differences of opinion over the correct interpretation of the Coptic consonant letters, particular the letters <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big>. <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> is transcribed as {{angle bracket|j}} in many older Coptic sources and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> as {{angle bracket|\u0261}}{{sfn|Plumley|1948}} or {{angle bracket|\u010d}}. {{harvtxt|Lambdin|1983}} notes that the current conventional pronunciations are different from the probable ancient pronunciations: Sahidic <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[t\u02b2]}} and <big>{{Coptic|\u03ed}}</big> was probably pronounced {{IPA|[k\u02b2]}}. {{harvtxt|Reintges|2004|p=22}} suggests that <big>{{Coptic|\u03eb}}</big> was pronounced {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}.\n\nThe following chart shows the consonants that are represented in Sahidic Coptic orthography.

Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic all interchangeably use their respective graphemes to indicate either sound; for example, Coptic for 'iron' appears alternately as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big>, <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c89\u2c9b\u2c93\u2ca1\u2c89}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c93\u2c83\u2c89}}</big>. That probably reflects dialect variation. Both letters were interchanged with <big>{{Coptic|\u2cab}}</big> and <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5}}</big> to indicate {{IPA|/f/}}, and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was also used in many texts to indicate the bilabial approximant {{IPA|/w/}}. [[Coptology|Coptologists]] believe that Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c83}}</big> was articulated as a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[\u03b2]}}. In the present-day Coptic Church services, this letter is realised as {{IPA|/v/}}, but it is almost certainly a result of the [[Coptic pronunciation reform|pronunciation reforms]] instituted in the 19th century.\n\nWhereas Old Egyptian contrasts {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}}, the two sounds appear to be in [[free variation]] in Coptic, as they were since the Middle Egyptian period. However, they are contrasted only in Greek loans; for example, native Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2c8d\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''anz\u012bb\u0259'') and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c9b\u2ca5\u2c8f\u2c83\u2c89}}</big> (''ans\u012bb\u0259'') 'school' are homophonous. Other consonants that sometimes appear to be either in free variation or to have different distributions across dialects are {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[d]}}, {{IPA|[r]}} and {{IPA|[l]}} (especially in the Fayyumic dialect, a feature of earlier Egyptian) and {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}, with the voiceless [[stop consonant]]s being more common in Coptic words and the voiced ones in Greek borrowings. Apart from the [[liquid consonant]]s, this pattern may indicate a [[sound change]] in Later Egyptian, leading to a neutralisation of voiced alveolar and velar plosives. When the voiced plosives are realised, it is usually the result of [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|consonant voicing]] in proximity to {{IPA|/n/}}.\n\nThough there is no clear evidence that Coptic had a [[glottal stop]], different orthographic means have been posited for indicating one by those who believe that it did: with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c81}}</big> word-initially, with <big>{{Coptic|\u2c93}}</big> word-finally in monosyllabic words in northern dialects and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c89}}</big> in monosyllabic words in Akhmimic and Assiutic, by reduplication of a vowel's grapheme but mostly unwritten.\n\nA few early manuscripts have a letter <big>{{coptic|\u2ccb}}</big> or <big>{{coptic|\u2cc3}}</big> ''\u00e7'' where Sahidic and Bohairic have <big>{{coptic|\u03e3}}</big> ''\u0161''. and Akhmimic has <big>{{coptic|\u2cc9}}</big> ''x''. This sound seems to have been lost early on.\n\n== Grammar ==\nCoptic is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] with [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order but can be [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] with the correct preposition in front of the subject. Number, gender, tense, and mood are indicated by prefixes that come from Late Egyptian. The earlier phases of Egyptian did this through suffixation. Some vestiges of the suffix inflection survive in Coptic, mainly to indicate [[inalienable possession]] and in some verbs. Compare the Middle Egyptian form ''*sat\u0101pafa'' 'he chooses' (written ''stp.f'' in hieroglyphs) to Coptic (Sahidic) ''f.sotp'' <big>{{Coptic|\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2ca7\u2ca1\u0305}}</big> 'he chooses'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAll Coptic nouns carry [[grammatical gender]], either masculine or feminine, usually marked through a prefixed definite article as in the [[Romance languages]]. Masculine nouns are marked with the article {{IPA|/p\u0259, pe\u02d0/}} and feminine nouns with the article {{IPA|/t\u0259, te\u02d0/}}{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=2}} in the Sahidic dialect and {{IPA|/pi, \u0259p/}} and {{IPA|/ti, \u0259t/}} in the Bohairic dialect.\n\nBohairic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c93\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u03ef\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283\u02bci\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nSahidic: <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c89\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c89}}</big> {{IPA|/p\u0259\u02c8\u027eo\u02d0m\u0259/}} - 'the man' / <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03eb\u2c93\u03eb}}</big> {{IPA|/t\u0259\u02c8t\u0361\u0283i\u02d0t\u0361\u0283/}} - 'the hand'\n\nThe definite and indefinite articles also indicate [[Grammatical number|number]]; however, only definite articles mark gender. Coptic has a number of [[broken plural]]s, a vestige of Older Egyptian, but in the majority of cases, the article marks number. Generally, nouns [[inflection|inflected]] for plurality end in {{IPA|/w\u0259/}}, but there are some irregularities. The dual was another feature of earlier Egyptian that survives in Coptic in only few words, such as <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca5\u2c9b\u2c81\u2ca9}}</big> (''snau'') 'two'.\n\nWords of Greek origin keep their original grammatical gender, except for neuter nouns, which become masculine in Coptic.\n\n==== Pronouns ====\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\nCoptic pronouns are of two kinds, dependent and independent. Independent pronouns are used when the pronoun is acting as the subject of a sentence, as the object of a verb, or with a preposition. Dependent pronouns are a series of prefixes and suffixes that can attach to verbs and other nouns. Coptic verbs can therefore be said to inflect for the person, number and gender of the subject and the object: a pronominal prefix marks the subject, and a pronominal suffix marks the object, e.g. \"I I'have'it the ball.\" When (as in this case) the subject is a pronoun, it normally isn't also expressed independently, unless for emphasis.\n\nAs in other Afroasiatic languages, gender of pronouns differ only in the second and third person singular. The following table shows the pronouns of the Sahidian dialect:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" |&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\" |Independent\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Proclitic\n! rowspan=\"2\" |As suffix\n|- style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n!

In all stages of Egyptian, this morpheme is also used to express the [[Genitive case|genitive]]; for example, the Bohairic word for 'Egyptian', <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99\u0300\u2c9b\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> {{IPA|/rem\u0259nk\u02b0e\u02d0m\u0259/}}, is a combination of the nominal prefix <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2c89\u2c99-}}</big> ''rem-'' (the reduced form of <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca3\u2cb1\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''r\u014dmi'' 'man'), followed by the genitive morpheme <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300}}</big> ''\u0259n'' ('of') and finally the word for Egypt, <big>{{Coptic|\u2cad\u2c8f\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> ''k\u02b0\u0113mi''.\n\n=== Verbs ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n====Verbal grade system ====\nCoptic, like Ancient Egyptian and Semitic languages, has root-and-pattern or templatic morphology, and the basic meaning of a verb is contained in a root and various derived forms of root are obtained by varying the vowel pattern. For example, the root for 'build' is ''kt''.  It has four derived forms: <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u0254t}} (the absolute state grade); <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7-}}</big> ket- (the nominal state grade), <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c9f\u2ca7\u2e17}}</big> kot= (the pronominal state grade), and <big>{{Coptic|\u2c95\u2c89\u2ca7}}</big> {{IPA|k\u025bt}} (the stative grade).\n(The nominal state grade is also called the construct state in some grammars of Coptic.)\n\nThe absolute, nominal, and pronominal state grades are used in different syntactic contexts. The absolute state grade of a transitive verb is used before a direct object with the accusative preposition {{IPA|/\u0259n, \u0259m/}}, and the nominal state grade is used before a direct object with no case-marking.  The pronominal state grade is used before a pronominal direct object enclitic. In addition, many verbs also have a neutral state grade, used to express a state resulting from the action of the verb. Compare the following forms:{{sfn|Lambdin|1983|p=39}}\n\n'''Absolute state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93 \u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijimi \u0259mpai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c93\u2c99\u2c93}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c99\u0300\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jimi \u0259m-p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.ABS PREP-DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Nominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99 \u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big> - ''Aijem pai\u014dt''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=NOM:nominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03eb\u2c89\u2c99}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca1\u2c81\u2c93\u2cb1\u2ca7}}</big>\n|a-i-jem p-a-i\u014dt\n|PFV-1SG-find.NOM DEF:MASC:SG-1SG-father\n|'I found my father.'}}\n\n'''Pronominal state grade'''\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big> - ''Aij\u0259ntf''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=PRONOM:pronominal state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c81\u2c93\u03ed\u2c89\u2c9b\u2ca7\u03e5}}</big>\n|a-i-j\u0259nt{{=}}f\n|PFV-1SG-find.PRONOM{{=}}3MSG\n|'I found him.'}}\n\nFor most transitive verbs, both absolute and nominal state grade verbs are available for non-pronominal objects. However, there is one important restriction, known as ''Jernstedt's rule'' (or the ''Stern-Jernstedt rule'') (Jernstedt 1927): present-tense sentences cannot be used in the nominal state grade. Thus sentences in the present tense always show a pattern like the first example above (absolute state), never the second pattern (nominal state).\n\nIn general, the four grades of Coptic verb are not predictable from the root, and are listed in the lexicon for each verb. The following chart shows some typical patterns of correspondence:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Absolute and neutral state forms are usually bisyllabic or contain a long vowel; the corresponding nominal state forms are monosyllabic or have short vowels.\n\n==== Tense/aspect/mood inflection ====\nCoptic has a very large number of distinct [[tense-aspect-mood]] categories, expressed by particles which are either before the verb or before the subject. The future I {{IPA|/na/}} is a preverbal particle and follows the subject:{{sfn|Reintges|2010|p=210}}\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5 \u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''Pecoeis nakrine \u0259nnelaos''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2ca0\u2c89\u03eb\u2c9f\u2c89\u2c93\u2ca5}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u2c81\u2c95\u2ca3\u2c93\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c97\u2c81\u2c9f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|Pe-coeis '''na'''-krine \u0259n-ne-laos\n|DEF:MASC:SG-lord FUT-judge PREP-DEF:PL-people\n|'The lord will judge the nations.'}}\n\nIn contrast, the perfective {{IPA|/a/}} is a pre-subject particle:\n\n<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80 \u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89 \u2c87\u2c89 \u2c9f\u2c97 \u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big> - ''A tefs\u014dne de ol \u0259nnefk\u0113s''\n\n:{{fs interlinear|ipa2=yes|ablist=ABS:absolute state grade\n|<big>{{Coptic|\u2c80}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2ca7\u2c89\u03e5\u2ca5\u2cb1\u2c9b\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c87\u2c89}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9f\u2c97}}</big> <big>{{Coptic|\u2c9b\u0300\u2c9b\u2c89\u03e5\u2c95\u2c8f\u2ca5}}</big>\n|'''A''' te-f-s\u014dne de ol \u0259n-ne-f-k\u0113s\n|PFV DEF:F:SG-3MSG-sister {{gcl|PART|particle}} carry.ABS PREP-DEF:PL-3MSG-bone\n|'His sister carried his bones.'}}\n\nThere is some variation in the labels for the tense/aspect/mood categories.

The British Museum, London]]\n[[File:Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Coptic and Arabic inscriptions in an Old Cairo church]]\n\nThere is little written evidence of [[dialect]]al differences in the pre-Coptic phases of the Egyptian language due to the centralised nature of the political and cultural institutions of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society. However, literary Old and Middle (Classical) Egyptian represent the spoken dialect of Lower Egypt around the city of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], the capital of Egypt in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. Later Egyptian is more representative of the dialects spoken in Upper Egypt, especially around the area of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] as it became the cultural and religious center of the New Kingdom.\n\nCoptic more obviously displays a number of regional dialects that were in use from the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in northern Egypt, south into [[Nubia]], and in the western oases. However, while many of these dialects reflect actual regional linguistic (namely [[phonology|phonological]] and some lexical) variation, they mostly reflect localised [[Orthography|orthographic]] traditions with very little [[syntax|grammatical]] differences.\n\n=== Upper Egypt ===\n\n==== Sahidic ====\n[[File:Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century CE. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London.jpg|thumb|Shred of a pottery vessel inscribed with 5 lines, Coptic Sahidic language. Byzantine period, 6th century AD. From Thebes, Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\n\n'''Sahidic''' (also known as '''Thebaic''') is the dialect in which most known Coptic texts are written, and was the leading dialect in the pre-[[Islam]]ic period. It is thought to have originally been a regional dialect from the area around [[Hermopolis]] (Coptic <big>{{Coptic|\u03e2\u2c99\u2c9f\u2ca9\u2c9b\u2c89\u2c93\u2c9b}}</big> ''Shmounein''). Around 300 it began to be written in literary form, including translations of major portions of the [[Bible]] (see [[Coptic versions of the Bible]]). By the 6th century, a standardised spelling had been attained throughout Egypt. Almost all native authors wrote in this dialect of Coptic. Sahidic was, beginning in the 9th century, challenged by Bohairic, but is attested as late as the 14th.\n\nWhile texts in other Coptic dialects are primarily translations of Greek literary and religious texts, Sahidic is the only dialect with a considerable body of original literature and non-literary texts. Because Sahidic shares most of its features with other dialects of Coptic with few peculiarities specific to itself, and has an extensive corpus of known texts, it is generally the dialect studied by learners of Coptic, particularly by scholars outside of the Coptic Church.\n\n==== Akhmimic ====\n'''Akhmimic''' was the dialect of the area around the town of [[Akhmim]] (Greek ''Panopolis''). It flourished during the fourth and fifth centuries, after which no writings are attested. Akhmimic is phonologically the most archaic of the Coptic dialects. One characteristic feature is the retention of the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/x/}}, which is realised as {{IPA|/\u0283/}} in most other dialects. Similarly, it uses an exceptionally conservative writing system strikingly similar to Old Coptic.\n\n==== Lycopolitan ====\n'''Lycopolitan''' (also known as '''Subakhmimic''' and '''Assiutic''') is a dialect closely related to Akhmimic in terms of when and where it was attested, but manuscripts written in Lycopolitan tend to be from the area of [[Asyut]]. The main differences between the two dialects seem to be graphic in nature. The Lycopolitan variety was used extensively for translations of [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] and [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] works, including the texts of the [[Nag Hammadi library]].\n\n=== Lower Egypt ===\n\n==== Bohairic ====\nThe '''Bohairic''' (also known as '''Memphitic''') dialect originated in the western [[Nile Delta]]. The earliest Bohairic manuscripts date to the 4th century, but most texts come from the 9th century and later; this may be due to poor preservation conditions for texts in the humid regions of northern Egypt. It shows several conservative features in [[lexicon]] and [[phonology]] not found in other dialects. Bohairic is the dialect used today as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church, replacing Sahidic some time in the eleventh century. In contemporary liturgical use, there are two traditions of pronunciation, arising from successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries (see [[Coptic pronunciation reform]]). Modern revitalisation efforts are based on this dialect.\n\n==== Fayyumic ====\n'''Fayyumic''' (also written as '''Faiyumic'''; in older works it is often called '''Bashmuric''') was spoken primarily in the [[Faiyum]] west of the Nile Valley. It is attested from the 3rd to the 10th centuries. It is most notable for writing {{coptic|\u2c97}} (which corresponds to {{IPA|/l/}}), where other dialects generally use <big>{{coptic|\u2ca3}}</big> {{IPA|/r/}} (probably corresponding to a [[Flap consonant|flap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}}). In earlier stages of Egyptian, the [[Liquid consonant|liquids]] were not distinguished in writing until the New Kingdom, when Late Egyptian became the administrative language. Late Egyptian orthography utilised a [[grapheme]] that combined the graphemes for {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} in order to express {{IPA|/l/}}. Demotic for its part indicated {{IPA|/l/}} using a diacritic variety of {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==== Oxyrhynchite ====\n'''Oxyrhynchite''' (also known as '''Mesokemic''' or [confusingly] '''Middle Egyptian''') is the dialect of [[Oxyrhynchus]] and surrounding areas. It shows similarities with Fayyumic and is attested in manuscripts from the fourth and fifth centuries.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Egypt|Languages}}\n* [[British Library Coptic Language Collection]]\n* [[Coptic alphabet]]\n* [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]\n* [[Egyptian language]]\n* [[Egyptian Arabic]]\n* [[Nag Hammadi library]]\n* [[List of Coptic place names]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n=== General studies ===\n* {{Cite journal |last=Abel |first=Carl |author-link=Carl Abel |year=1855 |title=On the Coptic Language |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=61 |journal=Transactions of the Philological Society |issue=5 |ref=Abel}}\n* Emmel, Stephen. 1992. \"Languages (Coptic)\".

He previously played for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and [[Chicago Cubs]]. \n\nArrieta played college baseball at [[Weatherford College|Weatherford Junior College]] and at [[Texas Christian University]] (TCU). He was an All-American and was named Mountain West Conference Pitcher of the Year at TCU. The Orioles selected Arrieta in the fifth round of the [[2007 Major League Baseball draft|2007 MLB draft]], and he signed a then record contract for a fifth round draft pick. He pitched for the [[United States national baseball team]] at the [[Baseball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympics]], winning the [[bronze medal]]. \n\nHe made his big league debut for the Orioles in 2010, and after four seasons Arrieta was traded to the Cubs in 2013. In 2015, Arrieta led MLB in wins with 22, pitched a [[no-hitter]], and won the 2015 National League [[Cy Young Award]]. In 2016, he was an NL [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All Star]], threw his second no-hitter, was awarded a [[Silver Slugger Award]], and won a [[2016 World Series|World Series]] with the Cubs. \n\nPrior to the start of the 2018 season, Arrieta signed a three-year, $75 million contract as a free agent with the Phillies.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel.
