[[Rail transport in India|Railway lines]] were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans murdered. By 13 April, the British government had decided to put most of Punjab under [[martial law]].

Reginald Dyer, the acting military commander for Amritsar and its environs, proceeded through the city with several city officials, announcing the implementation of a pass system to enter or leave Amritsar, a curfew beginning at 20:00 that night and a ban on all processions and public meetings of four or more persons. The proclamation was read and explained in English, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi, but few paid it any heed or appear to have learned of it later.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 252-253</ref> Meanwhile, local police had received intelligence of the planned meeting in the Jallianwala Bagh through word of mouth and plainclothes detectives in the crowds. At 12:40, Dyer was informed of the meeting and returned to his base at around 13:30 to decide how to handle it.<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 253</ref>\n\nBy mid-afternoon, thousands of Indians had gathered in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] (garden) near the [[Harmandir Sahib]] in Amritsar. Many who were present had earlier worshipped at the Golden Temple, and were passing through the Bagh on their way home. The Bagh was (and remains today) an open area of six to seven acres, roughly 200 yards by 200 yards in size, and surrounded on all sides by walls roughly 10 feet in height. Balconies of houses three to four stories tall overlooked the Bagh, and five narrow entrances opened onto it, several with lockable gates. During the rainy season, it was planted with crops, but served as a local meeting and recreation area for much of the year.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 254-255</ref> In the center of the Bagh was a ''samadhi'' (cremation site) and a large well partly filled with water which measured about 20 feet in diameter.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/>\n\nApart from pilgrims, Amritsar had filled up over the preceding days with farmers, traders, and merchants attending the annual Baisakhi horse and cattle fair. The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\n\n[[Reginald Dyer]] was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India.

The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L.

In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India, the [[Defence of India Act 1915]] was passed limiting civil and political liberties.

The pre-war [[Indian nationalist]] sentiment was revived as moderate and extremist groups of the [[Indian National Congress]] ended their differences to unify. In 1916, the Congress was successful in establishing the [[Lucknow Pact]], a temporary alliance with the [[All-India Muslim League]].

It was tasked to evaluate German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal.

The city police closed the fair at 14:00 that afternoon, resulting in a large number of people drifting into the Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nDyer arranged for an aeroplane to overfly the Bagh and estimate the size of the crowd, that he reported was about 6,000, while the [[Hunter Commission]] estimates a crowd of 10,000 to 20,000 had assembled by the time of Dyer's arrival.<ref name=\"Collett, p. 254-255\"/><ref name=\"Hunter\" /> Colonel Dyer and Deputy Commissioner Irving, the senior civil authority for Amritsar, took no actions to prevent the crowd assembling, or to peacefully disperse the crowds. This would later be a serious criticism levelled at both Dyer and Irving.\n \nAn hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 18:30, Colonel Dyer arrived at the Bagh with a group of ninety soldiers from the [[Gurkha| Gurkha Rifles]], the [[54th Sikhs (Frontier Force)|54th Sikhs]] and the [[59th Scinde Rifles (Frontier Force)|59th Sind Rifles]] .<ref name=\"archive.org\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/punjabdisturbanc01lahouoft|title=Punjab disturbances, April 1919; compiled from the Civil and military gazette|date=9 April 2018|publisher=Lahore Civil and Military Gazette Press|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Fifty of them were armed with [[.303 British|.303]] [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] bolt-action rifles. It is not clear whether Dyer had specifically chosen troops from that ethnic group due to their proven loyalty to the British or that they were simply the Sikh and non-Sikh units most readily available. He had also brought two armoured cars armed with machine guns; however, the vehicles were left outside, as they were unable to enter the Bagh through the narrow entrances. The Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had only five narrow entrances, most kept permanently locked. The main entrance was relatively wide, but was guarded heavily by the troops backed by the armoured vehicles.\n\nDyer, without warning the crowd to disperse, blocked the main exits. He stated later that this act \"was not to disperse the meeting but to punish the Indians for disobedience.\"<ref name=\"Collett, p 255-58\">Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer'' p 255-58</ref> Dyer ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd in front of the available narrow exits, where panicked crowds were trying to leave the Bagh. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. Cease-fire was ordered only when ammunition supplies were almost exhausted, after approximately 1,650 rounds were spent.<ref name=\"Colletp262\"/>\n\nApart from the many deaths directly from the shooting, a number of people died of crushing in the stampedes at the narrow gates or by jumping into the solitary well on the compound to escape the shooting. A plaque, placed at the site after independence, states that 120 bodies were removed from the well. The wounded could not be moved from where they had fallen, as a curfew was declared, and more who had been injured then died during the night.<ref>Collett, Nigel (2006).

The Government of Punjab, criticised by the [[Hunter Commission]] for not gathering accurate figures, only offered an approximate figure of 200. When interviewed by the members of the committee a senior civil servant in Punjab admitted that the actual figure could be higher.<ref name=\"Hunter\" /> The Sewa Samiti society independently carried out an investigation and reported 379 deaths, and 192 seriously wounded.

Referred to as the Disorders Inquiry Committee, it was later more widely known as the Hunter Commission. It was named after the chairman, [[William Hunter, Lord Hunter|William, Lord Hunter]], former Solicitor-General for Scotland and Senator of the College of Justice in Scotland. The stated purpose of the commission was to \"investigate the recent disturbances in [[Bombay]], [[Delhi]] and Punjab, about their causes, and the measures taken to cope with them\".<ref name=\"col333-334\">{{cite book|pages=333\u2013334|title=The Butcher of Amritsar: General Reginald Dyer|first=Nigel |last=Collett|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn= 9781852855758|location=Amritsar (India)}}</ref> The members of the commission were:\n\n*Lord Hunter, Chairman of the Commission\n*Mr Justice George C. Rankin of Calcutta\n*Sir [[Chimanlal Harilal Setalvad]], Vice-Chancellor of Bombay University and advocate of the Bombay High Court\n*W.F.

Stokes, Secretary of the Commission and member of the Home Department<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter meeting in New Delhi on 29 October, the Commission took statements from witnesses over the following weeks. Witnesses were called in Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bombay, and Lahore. Although the Commission as such was not a formally constituted court of law, meaning witnesses were not subject to questioning under oath, its members managed to elicit detailed accounts and statements from witnesses by rigorous cross-questioning. In general, it was felt the Commission had been very thorough in its enquiries.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> After reaching Lahore in November, the Commission wound up its initial inquiries by examining the principal witnesses to the events in Amritsar.\n\nOn 19 November, Dyer was ordered to appear before the Commission. Although his military superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, \"I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing, but they would have come back again and laughed, and I would have made, what I consider, a fool of myself.\"<ref>Steven Patterson, ''The cult of imperial honor in British India'' (2009) P. 67</ref> Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of \"rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well\".<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAfter Mr. Justice Rankin had questioned Dyer, Sir Chimanlal Setalvad enquired:\n\n{{quote|Sir Chimanlal: Supposing the passage was sufficient to allow the armoured cars to go in, would you have opened fire with the machine guns?\n\nDyer: I think probably, yes.\n\nSir Chimanlal: In that case, the casualties would have been much higher?\n\nDyer: Yes.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>}}\n\nDyer further stated that his intentions had been to strike terror throughout Punjab and in doing so, reduce the moral stature of the \"rebels\". He said he did not stop the shooting when the crowd began to disperse because he thought it was his duty to keep shooting until the crowd dispersed, and that minimal shooting would not prove effective. In fact, he continued the shooting until the ammunition was almost exhausted.<ref>Nick Lloyd, ''The Amritsar Massacre: The Untold Story of One Fateful Day'' (2011) p. 157</ref> He stated that he did not make any effort to tend to the wounded after the shooting: \"Certainly not. It was not my job. Hospitals were open and they could have gone there.\"<ref>Collett, ''The Butcher of Amritsar'' p. 337</ref>\n\nExhausted from the rigorous cross-examination questioning and unwell, Dyer was then released. Over the next several months, while the Commission wrote its final report, the British press, as well as many MPs, turned increasingly hostile towards Dyer as the full extent of the massacre and his statements at the inquiry became widely known.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> Lord Chelmsford refused to comment until the Commission had been wound up. In the meanwhile, Dyer became seriously ill with [[jaundice]] and [[arteriosclerosis]], and was hospitalised.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/>\n\nAlthough the members of the Commission had been divided by racial tensions following Dyer's statement, and though the Indian members had written a separate, minority report, the final report, comprising six volumes of evidence and released on 8 March 1920, unanimously condemned Dyer's actions.<ref name=\"col333-334\"/> In \"continuing firing as long as he did, it appears to us that General Dyer committed a grave error.\"<ref>Cyril Henry Philips, \"The evolution of India and Pakistan, 1858 to 1947: select documents\" p.214. Oxford University Press, 1962</ref> Dissenting members argued that the martial law regime's use of force was wholly unjustified. \"General Dyer thought he had crushed the rebellion and Sir [[Michael O'Dwyer]] was of the same view\", they wrote, \"(but) there was no rebellion which required to be crushed.\" The report concluded that:\n\n* Lack of notice to disperse from the Bagh, in the beginning, was an error.\n* The length of firing showed a grave error.\n* Dyer's motive of producing a sufficient moral effect was to be condemned.\n* Dyer had overstepped the bounds of his authority.\n* There had been no conspiracy to overthrow British rule in the Punjab.\n\nThe minority report of the Indian members further added that:\n\n* Proclamations banning public meetings were insufficiently distributed.\n* Innocent people were in the crowd, and there had been no violence in the Bagh beforehand.\n* Dyer should have either ordered his troops to help the wounded or instructed the civil authorities to do so.\n* Dyer's actions had been \"inhuman and un-British\" and had greatly injured the image of British rule in India.\n\nThe Hunter Commission did not impose any penal or disciplinary action because Dyer's actions were condoned by various superiors (later upheld by the Army Council).<ref name=\"churchillspeech\">{{cite web |date=8 July 1920 | title = Winston Churchill's speech in the House of Commons  | author1=Winston Churchill | url=http://lachlan.bluehaze.com.au/churchill/amritsar.htm |accessdate=14 September 2010}}</ref> The Legal and Home Members on the Viceroy's Council ultimately decided that, though Dyer had acted in a callous and brutal way, military or legal prosecution would not be possible due to political reasons. However, he was finally found guilty of a mistaken notion of duty and relieved of his command on 23 March. He had been recommended for a CBE as a result of his service in the Third Afghan War; this recommendation was cancelled on 29 March 1920.\n\n[[Reginald Dyer]] was disciplined by being removed from his appointment, was passed over for promotion and was prohibited from further employment in India.

Police and aircraft were used against the demonstrators, resulting in 12 deaths and 27 injuries. The Officer Commanding the [[Royal Air Force]] in India, [[Norman MacEwen|Brigadier General N D K MacEwen]] stated later that:\n\n<blockquote>I think we can fairly claim to have been of great use in the late riots, particularly at Gujranwala, where the crowd when looking at its nastiest was absolutely dispersed by a machine using bombs and Lewis guns.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |title=Royal Air Force Power Review |date=Spring 2008 |volume= |series=1 |accessdate=24 October 2010 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606163004/http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcms/mediafiles/BC18F893_1143_EC82_2E16AC19F19FE2D2.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Assassination of Michael O'Dwyer===\n{{See also|Udham Singh}}\n[[File:Sir-Michael-ODwyer.jpg|thumb|right| [[Michael O'Dwyer]] c. 1912]]\n\nOn 13 March 1940, at Caxton Hall in London, [[Udham Singh]], an Indian independence activist from Sunam who had witnessed the events in Amritsar and had himself been wounded, shot and killed [[Michael O'Dwyer]], the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab at the time of the massacre, who had approved Dyer's action and was believed to have been the main planner.\n\nSome, such as the nationalist newspaper ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', made statements supporting the killing. The common people and revolutionaries glorified the action of Udham Singh. Much of the press worldwide recalled the story of Jallianwala Bagh, and alleged O'Dwyer to have been responsible for the massacre. Singh was termed a \"fighter for freedom\" and his action was referred to in ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper as \"an expression of the pent-up fury of the down-trodden Indian People\".<ref>''The Times'', London, 16 March 1940</ref> Reporter and historian [[William L. Shirer]] wrote the next day, \"Most of the other Indians I know [other than Gandhi] will feel this is divine retribution.

Similar comment may be made on British rule in India. Will the historians of the future have to record that it was not the [[Nazism|Nazis]] but the British ruling class which destroyed the British Empire?\" Singh had told the court at his trial:\n[[File:Massacre memorial in Amritsar.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Wide view of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial]]\n<blockquote>I did it because I had a grudge against him.

I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of death. I am dying for my country. I have seen my people starving in India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the sake of my motherland?<ref>CRIM 1/1177, Public Record Office, London, p 64</ref></blockquote>\n\nSingh was hanged for the murder on 31 July 1940. At that time, many, including [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]], condemned the murder as senseless even if it was courageous. In 1952, Nehru (by then Prime Minister) honoured Udham Singh with the following statement, which appeared in the daily Partap:\n\n<blockquote>I salute Shaheed-i-Azam Udham Singh with reverence who had kissed the noose so that we may be free.</blockquote>\n\nSoon after this recognition by the Prime Minister, Udham Singh received the title of ''[[Martyrdom in Islam|Shaheed]]'', a name given to someone who has attained martyrdom or done something heroic on behalf of their country or religion.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Monument and legacy==\n[[File:Jallianwala Bagh Entrance.JPG|left|thumb|Entrance to the present-day [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675316515).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque at [[Jallianwala Bagh]].]]\n[[File:Plaque in Passageway Memorializing 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675337405).jpg|left|thumb|Memorial plaque in passageway of [[Jallianwala Bagh]] site.]]\n[[File:Bullet Holes in Wall from 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675568575).jpg|left|thumb|Bullet holes in wall at [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n[[File:Martyrs Well - Where Victims Leapt to Escape 1919 Amritsar Massacre - Jallianwala Bagh - Amritsar - Punjab - India (12675387185).jpg|left|thumb|Martyrs Well at the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] memorial.]]\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     =\n| image1    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marked Wall.JPG\n| caption1  = Bullet marks, visible on preserved walls, at present-day Jallianwala Bagh\n| image2    = Jallianwala Bagh Bullet Marks.JPG\n| caption2  =\n}}\n\nA trust was founded in 1920 to build a memorial at the site after a resolution was passed by the Indian National Congress.

It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl.

The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule. Even more remarkably, it has remained under Muslim rule ever since.

Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]].

It ended the long period of [[Roman Egypt|Roman and Byzantine rule]] in Egypt. Byzantine rule in the country had been shaken, as Egypt had been [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|conquered and occupied for a decade]] by the [[Sassanid Empire]] in 618\u2013629, before being recovered by the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]]. The Caliphate took advantage of the Byzantines' exhaustion and captured Egypt ten years after its reconquest by Heraclius.\n\nDuring the mid-630s, Byzantium had already lost the [[Levant]] and its [[Ghassanid]] allies in Arabia to the Caliphate. The loss of the prosperous province of Egypt and the defeat of the Byzantine armies severely weakened the empire, resulting in further territorial losses in the centuries to come.<ref name=\"Haykalch18\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 18}}</ref>\n\n==Rashidun invasion of Egypt==\n===Crossing Egyptian border===\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Pyramids of Giza]]\nIn December 639, [['Amr ibn al-'As]] left for Egypt with a force of 4,000 troops. Most of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of 'Ak, but [[Al-Kindi]] mentioned that one third of the soldiers belonged to the Arab tribe of Ghafik. The Arab soldiers were also joined by some Roman and [[Persian Empire|Persian]] converts to Islam. However, 'Umar, the Muslim caliph, reconsidered his orders to Amr and considered it foolhardy to expect to conquer such a large country as Egypt with a mere 4,000 soldiers. Accordingly, he wrote a letter to 'Amr ordering him to come back.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 19}}</ref>\n\nThe messenger, 'Uqbah ibn 'Amr, caught up with Amr at [[Rafah]], a little short of the Egyptian frontier. Guessing what might be in the letter, 'Amr ordered the army to quicken its pace. Turning to 'Uqbah, 'Amr said that he would receive the caliph's letter from him when the army had halted after the day's journey. 'Uqbah, unaware of the contents of the letter, agreed and marched along with the army. The army halted for the night at Shajratein, a little valley near the city of [[El Arish]], which 'Amr knew to be beyond the Egyptian border.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\">Al-Maqrizi, Mawaiz wa al-'i'tibar bi dhikr al-khitat wa al-'athar.</ref> 'Amr then received and read 'Umar's letter and went on to consult his companions as to the course of action to be adopted. The unanimous view was that as they had received the letter on Egyptian soil, they had permission to proceed.\n\nWhen 'Umar received the reply, he decided to watch further developments and to start concentrating fresh forces at Madinah that could be dispatched to Egypt as reinforcements. On [[Eid al-Adha]], the Muslim army marched from Shajratein to [[El Arish]],<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> a small town lacking a garrison. The town put up no resistance, and the citizens offered allegiance on the usual terms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Muslim soldiers celebrated the Eid festival there.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Conquest of Pelusium and Belbeis===\nIn of December 639 or early January 640, the Muslim army reached [[Pelusium]], a garrison city considered to be the eastern gateway to Egypt at the time. The siege of the town dragged on for two months. In February 640, an assault group, led by the prominent Huzaifah ibn Wala, successfully captured the fort and city.<ref>Al-Kamil, pp. 451\u2013452</ref><ref>Al-Gawzi, Al-Montazim, pp. 532\u2013534</ref><ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], History of the Kings, p. 862</ref><ref>[[Abu Salih the Armenian]], ''The churches and monasteries of Egypt and some neighbouring countries'', tr.

[[Belbeis]] was the first place in Egypt that the Byzantines showed some measure of resistance towards the Arabs. Two Christian monks, accompanied by Cyrus of Alexandria and the famous Roman general Aretion, came out to negotiate with [['Amr ibn al-'As]]. Aretion had been the Byzantine governor of [[Jerusalem]] and had fled to Egypt when the city fell to the Muslims. 'Amr gave them three options: convert to Islam, pay the [[jizya]], or fight. They requested three days to reflect and then, according to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], requested two extra days.\n\nAt the end of the five days, the two monks and the general decided to reject Islam and the jizya and fight the Muslims, thus disobeying Cyrus, who wanted to surrender and pay jizya. Cyrus left for the [[Babylon Fortress]]. The battle resulted in a Muslim victory during which Aretion was killed. 'Amr ibn al-'As subsequently attempted to convince the native Egyptians to aid the Arabs and surrender the city, based on the kinship between Egyptians and Arabs via [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]].<ref name=\"Butler216\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=216}}</ref> When the Egyptians refused, the siege resumed until the city fell around the end of March 640.<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> Now, the Arabs were only one day away from the head of the [[Nile Delta|Delta]].\n\n===Siege of Babylon===\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Muslim conquest of Egypt.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Map detailing the route of the Muslims' invasion of Egypt]]\nAmr had assumed that Egypt would be a pushover but was quickly proven wrong. Even at the outposts of Pelusium and Belbeis, the Muslims had met stiff resistance, with sieges of two and one months, respectively. As Babylon, near what is now Cairo, was a larger and more important city, resistance on a larger scale was expected.<ref name=\"Haykalch19\"/> The Muslims arrived at Babylon some time in May 640.<ref name=\"Butler\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902}}</ref>\n\nBabylon was a fortified city, and the Romans had indeed prepared it for a siege. Outside the city, a [[ditch (fortification)|ditch]] had been dug, and a large force was positioned in the area between the ditch and the city walls. The Muslims besieged the fort, a massive structure {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=on}} high with walls more than {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=off}} thick and studded with numerous [[tower]]s and [[bastion]]s and a force of some 4,000 men. Early Muslim sources place the strength of the Byzantine force in Babylon at about six times the strength of the Muslim force. For the next two months, fighting remained inconclusive, with the Byzantines repulsing every Muslim assault.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nLater the same month, 'Amr sent a detachment to raid the city of [[Fayoum]]. The Byzantines had anticipated that and so had strongly guarded the roads that led to the city and had fortified their garrison in the nearby town of [[Lahun]]. When the Muslims realised that Fayoum was too strong for them to take, they headed towards the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western Desert]], where they looted all the cattle and animals that they could. They subsequently headed to [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Per-Medjed), which was defeated. The Arabs then returned to [[Lower Egypt]] down the [[River Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler254-255\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|pp=254\u2013255}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements from Madinah====\nIn July, 'Amr wrote to 'Umar requesting reinforcements, but before the letter reached him, the caliph had already dispatched 4,000 men, mostly veterans of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Syrian campaigns]], to bolster Amr's strength. Even with the reinforcements, 'Amr was unsuccessful and so, by August, 'Umar had assembled another 4,000-strong force, consisting of four columns, each of 1,000 elite men. [[Zubair ibn al-Awam]], a renowned warrior and commander, veteran of the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] and once a part of [[Khalid ibn Walid]]'s elite [[mobile guard]], was appointed the supreme commander of the army.\n\n'Umar had also offered Zubair the chief command and governorship of Egypt, but Zubair had declined. The column commanders included [[Miqdad bin Al-Aswad|Miqdad ibn al-Aswad]], [[Ubaida bin As-Samit|Ubaidah ibn as-Samit]] and [[Kharija bin Huzafa|Kharijah ibn Huzaifah]]. The reinforcements arrived at Babylon sometime in September 640, bringing the total strength of the Muslim force to 12,000, still quite modest.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>\n\n====Battle of Heliopolis====\n{{main|Battle of Heliopolis}}\nThe Muslim army reached [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]], 15 km (10 mi) from Babylon,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> in July 640.<ref>Raymond, Andre, ''Cairo'', transl. Willard Wood, (Harvard University Press, 2000), p. 10.</ref> The city boasted the Sun Temple of the [[Pharaohs]] and grandiose monuments and learning institutions.<ref name=\"Butler258\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=258}}</ref> There was the danger that forces from Heliopolis could attack the Muslims from the flank while they were engaged with the Roman army at Babylon.\n\nThere was a cavalry clash near the current neighbourhood of [[Abbaseya]]. The engagement was not decisive, but it resulted in the occupation of the fortress located between the current neighborhoods of Abdyn and Azbakeya. The defeated Byzantine soldiers retreated to either the Babylon Fortress or the fortress of Niki\u00fb.<ref name=\"Butler263\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=263}}</ref> Zubair and some of his handpicked soldiers scaled the Heliopolis city wall at an unguarded point and, after overpowering the guards, opened the gates for the army to enter the city. After the capture of Heliopolis, 'Amr and Zubair returned to Babylon.\n\n====Conquering of Fayoum and Babylon====\n{{main article|Siege of Babylon Fortress}}\nWhen news of the Muslims' victory at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] reached Fayoum, its Byzantine garrison, under the command of Domentianus, evacuated the city during the night and fled to Abuit and then down the [[Nile]] to Nikiu without informing the people of Fayoum and Abuit that they were abandoning their cities to the enemy. When news reached 'Amr, he sent troops across the [[Nile]] to invade Fayoum and Abuit, capturing the entire province of Fayoum without any resistance.<ref name=\"Butler264\">{{harvnb|Butler|1902|p=264}}</ref>\n\nThe Byzantine garrison at [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]] had grown bolder than ever before and had begun to sally forth across the ditch but with little success. The stalemate was broken when the Muslim commanders devised an ingenious strategy, inflicting heavy casualties on the Byzantine forces by encircling them from three sides during one of their sallies. The Byzantines were able to retreat back to the fort, but were left too weak for any further offensive action, forcing them to negotiate. The Byzantine general, Theodorus, shifted his headquarters to the Isle of Rauda, and Cyrus of Alexandria, popularly known as ''Muqawqis'' in Muslim history, entered into fruitless negotiations with the Muslims.\n\nEmissaries were also exchanged between Theodorus and 'Amr, leading to 'Amr meeting Theodorus in person. Then, with negotiations stalled, during the night of 20 December, a company of handpicked warriors, led by Zubair, managed to scale the wall, kill the guards, and open the gates for the Muslim army to enter. The city was captured by the Muslims the following morning with tactics similar to those that had been used by Khalid ibn Walid at Damascus. However, Theodorus and his army managed to slip away to the island of Rauda during the night.<ref name=\"Haykalch21\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 21}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Thebaid (Southeastern Egypt)===\nOn 22 December, Cyrus of Alexandria entered a treaty with the Muslims,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 22}}</ref> recognizing Muslim sovereignty over the whole of Egypt and effectively over [[Thebaid]], and agreeing to pay Jizya at the rate of 2 diners per male adult.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The treaty was subject to the approval of the emperor Heraclius, but Cyrus stipulated that even if the emperor repudiated the treaty, he and the [[Copts]], of whom he was the High Priest, would honour its terms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Omar (634-644)\", The Islamic World to 1600 Multimedia History Tutorials by the Applied History Group, University of Calgary. Last accessed 20 Oct 2006</ref> Cyrus asked Heraclius to ratify the treaty and offered an argument in support. 'Amr submitted a detailed report to Umar recommending ratification.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He desired that as soon as the reactions of Heraclius were known, he should be informed so that further necessary instructions could be issued promptly.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nHeraclius rejected the treaty, stripping Cyrus of the viceroyship although he remained head of the Coptic Church. Heraclius sent strict orders to the commander-in-chief of the Byzantine forces in Egypt that the Muslims should be driven out of Egypt. Cyrus, in reporting Heraclius' response to 'Amr, reassured him that the Copts would honor the treaty regardless. It is recorded that Cyrus requested three favours from the Muslims:\n#Do not break your treaty with the Copts.\n#If the Byzantines after the repudiation ask for peace, do not make peace with them, but treat them as captives and slaves; and\n#When I am dead, allow me to be buried in the [[Church (building)|Church]] of [[John the Merciful|St. John]] at Alexandria.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/>{{full citation needed|date=July 2017}}<ref name=\"Haykalch23\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 23}}</ref> \n\nAs the Copts were native Egyptians, the treaty provided a strategic advantage to the Muslims. 'Umar, upon learning of these developments, made preparations for a pre-emptive strike against the Byzantines in Alexandria.{{cn|date=August 2019}}\n\n===March to Alexandria===\n[[File:Alexandrie 112004 02.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Ancient Roman theaters in Alexandria]]\nThe Byzantine commanders, knowing full well that the Muslims' next target was Alexandria, set out to repel the Muslims through continued sallies from the fort or, at least, to exhaust them and erode their morale in a campaign of attrition.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> In February 641, 'Amr set off for Alexandria from Babylon with his army, encountering defending regiments all along the route. On the third day of their marchn the Muslims' advance guard encountered a Byzantine detachment at Tarnut on the west bank of the [[Nile]].<ref name=\"Butler\"/> The Byzantines failed to inflict heavy losses but were able to delay the advance by a full day. The Muslim commanders decided to halt the main army at Tarnut and send an advance guard of cavalry forward to clear the path.\n\nNow {{convert|30|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Tarnut, the Byzantine detachment that had withdrawn from Tarnut the day before joined another that was already at Shareek, and both attacked and routed the Muslim cavalry. The next day, before the Byzantines could annihilate the Muslim advance guard completely, the main Muslim army arrived, prompting the Byzantines to withdraw. The following day, the whole army marched forward without an advance guard. The Muslims reached Sulteis, where they encountered another Byzantine detachment. Hard fighting followed, but the Byzantine resistance soon broke down and they withdrew to Alexandria.\n\nThe Muslims halted at Sulteis for a day, still two days' march from Alexandria. After another day's march, the Muslim forces arrived at Kirayun, {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} from Alexandria. There, the Muslim advance to Alexandria was blocked by a Byzantine force about 20,000 strong. The resulting action remained indecisive for ten days.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> However, on the tenth day, the Muslims launched a vigorous assault, forcing the defeated Byzantines to retreat to Alexandria. With the way to Alexandria clear, the Muslims reached the capital's outskirts in March.\n\n===Conquest of Alexandria and fall of Egypt===\n{{Main|Siege of Alexandria (641)}}\nThe Muslims laid siege to Alexandria in March 641.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The city was heavily fortified and provisioned: there were walls within walls and forts within forts. The city also had direct access to the sea by which men and supplies from [[Constantinople]] could come at any time.\n\nAs 'Amr surveyed the military situation, he felt that the conquest of Alexandria would be difficult.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The Byzantines had high stakes in Alexandria and were determined to offer stiff resistance to the Muslims. They mounted catapults on the walls of the city, and the engines effectively pounded the Muslims with boulders, prompting 'Amr to withdraw out of range. The ensuing battle see-sawed:<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> when the Muslims approached the city, they were pelted with missiles, and, when the Byzantines sallied from the fort, they were invariably beaten back by the Muslims.\n\nIt is said{{by whom|date=May 2019}} that Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor, collected a large army at Constantinople, intending to lead it personally to Alexandria. However, before he could finalize the arrangements, he died. The troops mustered at Constantinople dispersed, and no help came to Alexandria, which further demoralied the defenders. The siege dragged on for six months, and in [[Madinah]], 'Umar, got impatient. In a letter addressed to 'Amr, the caliph, concerned at the inordinate delay, appointed 'Ubaidah as field commander to assault the fort. 'Ubaidah's assault was successful, and [[Siege of Alexandria (641)|Alexandria was captured]] by the Muslims in September. Thousands of Byzantine soldiers were killed or taken captive, and others managed to flee to Constantinople on ships that had been anchored in the port. Some wealthy traders also left.<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nOn behalf of the Egyptians, Cyrus of Alexandria sued for peace, and his request was granted. After the conquest of Egypt, 'Amr is reported{{by whom|date=May 2019}} to have written to 'Umar, \"We have conquered Alexandria. In this city there are 4,000 palaces, 400 places of entertainment, and untold wealth.\"\n\nOn the twentieth of Maskaram (approximately September 18 according to the Julian calendar), the Byzantine general, Theodorus, and all of his troops proceeded to the island of [[Cyprus]], abandoning [[Alexandria]] to 'Amr. The conquest represented a huge loss of food and money to Byzantium and, coupled with the conquest of [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and the later [[Umayyad invasion of North Africa|invasion of the Exarchate of Africa]], meant that the Mediterranean, long referred to as the \"Roman lake\", was now contested between the [[Muslim Caliphate]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The latter, although sorely tested, would be able to hold on to [[Anatolia]], while the [[walls of Constantinople]] would withstand two great Muslim sieges, saving the Byzantines from the fate of the Persian Empire.<ref>Kaegli, Walter. Heraclius: Emperor of Byzantium.</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Nubia==\nIn the summer of 642, 'Amr ibn al-'As sent an expedition to the Christian kingdom of [[Nubia]], which bordered Egypt to the south, under the command of his cousin 'Uqbah ibn Nafi as a pre-emptive raid to announce the arrival of new rulers in Egypt.<ref>Akram, A.I., ''Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa'', {{ISBN|978-0-19-597712-7}}</ref> 'Uqbah ibn Nafi, who later made a great name for himself as the conqueror of Africa and led his horse to the Atlantic, had an unhappy experience in Nubia. No pitched battle was fought, but there were only [[skirmishes]] and haphazard engagements, the type of warfare in which the Nubians excelled. They were skilful archers and subjected the Muslims to a merciless barrage of arrows, resulting in 250 Muslims losing their eyes in the engagement.\n\nThe Nubian cavalry displayed remarkable speed,<ref name=\"newadvent.org\"/> even more so than the Muslim cavalry. The Nubians would strike hard and then vanish before the Muslims could recover and counterattack. The hit-and-run raids took their toll on the Muslim expedition. 'Uqbah reported that to 'Amr,<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> who ordered 'Uqbah to withdraw from Nubia, terminating the expedition.\n\n==Conquest of North Africa==\nAfter the expedition to Nubia, 'Amr opted to secure the western borders of Egypt and clear the regions of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]] of Byzantine influence. In September 642, 'Amr led his troops west. After one month of marching the Muslim forces reached the cities of the [[Pentapolis (North Africa)|Pentapolis]]. From Burqa, he sent 'Uqbah bin Nafi at the head of a column to undertake a campaign against Fezzan, in present-day northwestern [[Libya]]. 'Uqbah marched to Zaweela, the capital; the entire district then submitted to the Muslims without resistance. 'Uqbah then returned to [[Brak, Libya|Burqa]]. Soon after the Muslim army marched westward from there, arriving at [[Tripoli]] in the spring of 643. The city fell after a siege of one month. From there, 'Amr sent a detachment to [[Sabratha]], 65 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) away. The city put up feeble resistance, and soon surrendered and agreed to pay Jizya. From Tripoli, 'Amr is reported{{whom|date=May 2019}} to have reported to the caliph, \"We have conquered Burqa, Tripoli and Sabratha. The way to the west is clear, and if the Commander of the Faithful wishes to conquer more lands, we could do so with the grace of God.\"\n\n'Umar, whose armies were already engaged in conquering the [[Sassanid Empire]], did not want to commit his forces further in North Africa while Muslim rule in Egypt was still insecure. The caliph accordingly ordered 'Amr to consolidate the Muslims' position in Egypt and that there should be no further campaigning. 'Amr obeyed, abandoning Tripoli and Burqa and returning to [[Fustat]] towards the close of 643.<ref name=\"Haykalch24\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 24}}</ref>\n\n==Taxation under Muslim rule==\nThose who refused to convert to Islam were taxed in the form of money and food for the occupying troops, and in exchange, the taxpayers were excused from military service and left free in the observance of their religion and the administration of their affairs. The system was a new institution, a religious mandate, but carried over from previous [[poll tax]] systems in the ancient Middle East.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Indeed, the Egyptians had been subject to it, as non-Romans, during Roman rule before the [[Christianization|adoption of Christianity]] by the Roman state.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Then, all non-Christian subjects of the [[Roman Empire]] had to pay it, including non-Christian Egyptians.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The Persians also had a similar poll tax system.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Egypt under Muslim rule==\n[[File:Mohammad adil-Rashidun-empire-at-its-peak-close.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Rashidun Empire at its peak under third Rashidun Caliph, Uthman- 654 {{legend|#009900|Strongholds of Rashidun Caliphate}}]]\nMuslims gained control over Egypt by  a variety of factors, including internal Byzantine politics, religious zeal and the difficulty of maintaining a large empire. The Byzantines attempted to regain Alexandria, but it was retaken by 'Amr in 646. In 654 an invasion fleet sent by [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] was repelled. No serious effort was then made by the Byzantines to regain possession of Egypt.\n\nIn ''The Great Arab Conquests'', Hugh Kennedy writes that Cyrus, the Roman governor, had exiled the Coptic patriarch, [[Pope Benjamin I of Alexandria|Benjamin]]. When 'Amr occupied Alexandria, a Coptic nobleman (''duqs'') called Sanutius persuaded him to send out a proclamation of safe conduct for Benjamin and an invitation to return to Alexandria. When Benjamin arrived, after 13 years in hiding, Amr treated him with respect. Benjamin was then instructed by the governor to resume control over the [[Coptic Church]]. He arranged for the restoration of the monasteries in the [[Wadi Natrun]], which had been ruined by the [[Chalcedonean Christians]]; four of them still survive as functioning monasteries.<ref name=\"Kennedy164\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=164}}</ref>\n\nOn Amr's return, the Egyptian population also worked with him.<ref name=\"Kennedy167\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=167}}</ref> Kennedy wrote, \"The pious biographer of Coptic patriarch Benjamin presents us with the striking image of the patriarch prayed for the success of the Muslim commander Amr against the Christians of the Cyrenaica. Benjamin survived for almost twenty years after the fall of Egypt to the Muslims, dying of full years and honour in 661. His body was laid to rest in the [[monastery of St Macarius]], where he is still venerated as a saint. There can be no doubt that he played a major role in the survival of the Coptic Church\".<ref name=\"Kennedy164\"/> Benjamin also prayed for 'Amr when he attempted to take Libya.<ref name=\"Kennedy163\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=163}}</ref>\n\nKennedy also wrote, \"Even more striking is the verdict of John of Nikiu. John was no admirer of Muslim government and was fierce in his denunciation, but he says of Amr: 'He extracted the taxes which had been determined upon but he took none of the property of the churches, and he committed no act of spoliation or plunder, and he preserved them throughout all his days.... Of all the early Muslim conquests, that of Egypt was the swiftest and most complete. Within a space of two years the country had come entirely under Arab rule. Even more remarkably, it has remained under Muslim rule ever since. Seldom in history can so massive a political change have happened so swiftly and been so long lasting.\"<ref name=\"Kennedy165\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=165}}</ref>\n\n[[Uqba ibn Nafi]] then used Egypt as a launch pad to move across North Africa, all the way to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref name=\"Kennedy212\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=212}}</ref> Kennedy wrote that when Uqba reached the Atlantic, he is said to have ridden his horse into the sea until the water was below his chest, and then shouted, 'O Lord, if the sea did not stop me, I would go through lands like Alexander the Great, defending your faith'. Kennedy writes further that the image of a warrior whose conquest in the name of God was stopped only by the ocean remains important in the history of the conquests.<ref name=\"Kennedy214\">{{harvnb|Kennedy|2007|p=214}}</ref>\n\n===Fustat, the new capital===\nDuring the Egyptian campaign, Alexandria was the capital of Egypt. When Alexandria was captured by the Muslims, the houses vacated by the Byzantines were occupied by the Muslims, who were impressed and attracted by Alexandria, \"the queen of cities\". 'Amr wanted Alexandria to remain the capital of Muslim Egypt.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> He wrote to 'Umar to propose that but 'Umar refused on the basis that Alexandria was a [[coast|maritime]] city, and there would always be a danger that the [[Byzantine Navy]] would attack.<ref name=\"Butler\"/> He suggested instead for the capital would be established at a central location further inland, where no mass of water separated it from Arabia.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/> The treaty with Cyrus of Alexandria was followed, and the wealth of the Egyptians in Alexandria was spared and that of Romans and [[Greeks]] was taken as booty. Greek citizens were given a choice: return to Greek territories safely without their wealth or stay in Alexandria and pay [[Jizya]]. Some chose to stay, and others went to Byzantine lands.\n\n'Amr next proceeded to choose a suitable site for the capital of Egypt, eventually settling on the site where he had pitched his tent at the time of the battle of Babylon, about 400 m (500 yd) northeast of the fort. It is reported that after the battle was over and the army was about to march to Alexandria, the men began to pull down the tent and pack it for the journey, and it was found that a [[dove]] had nested on top of the tent and laid eggs. 'Amr ordered that the tent be left standing where it was, where it remained after the army departed. 'Amr took the unusual episode as a sign from Heaven and decided \"where the dove laid its nest, let the people build their city\".\n\nAs 'Amr's tent was to be the focal point of the city, the city was called [[Fustat]], meaning in Arabic \"the tent\". The first structure to be built was the [[mosque]] that later became famous as [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of 'Amr ibn al-'As]].<ref name=\"tertullian.org\">http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm</ref> In the course of time, Fustat extended to include the old town of Babylon to the west, becoming the bustling commercial centre of Egypt.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\n==='Umar's reforms===\nTo consolidate his rule in Egypt, 'Umar imposed the jizya on Egyptians. During later [[Umayyad]] rule, higher taxes would be levied. With 'Umar's permission, 'Amr decided to build a [[canal]] to join the [[Nile]] with the [[Red Sea]] to open new markets for Egyptian merchants and an easy route to Arabia and [[Iraq]]. The project was presented to 'Umar, who approved it. A canal was dug and, within a few months, was opened for merchants. It was named \"Nahar Amir ul-Mu'mineen\" (''the canal of the Commander of the Faithful''), after 'Umar's title.<ref name=\"Haykalch22\"/>\n\nAmr proposed to dig another canal joining the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> but Umar rejected the plan on the basis that it would open a way for the Byzantine Navy to enter the Red Sea and pose a threat to [[Medina]] itself.<ref name=\"Al-Maqrizi\"/> The plan would not come to fruition until the [[Suez Canal]] was completed 1300 years later. Each year, the caliph earmarked a large amount of jizya, to be used on the building and repairing of canals and bridges.<ref name=\"Haykalch25\">{{harvnb|Haykal|1944|loc=chpt. 25}}</ref> The Arabs remained in control of the country from this point until 1250, when it fell under the control of the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aegyptus (Roman province)]]\n*[[Muslim conquests]]\n*[[Byzantine-Arab Wars]]\n*[[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]]\n*[[Spread of Islam]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Betts|first=Robert B.|title=Christians in the Arab East: A Political Study|year=1978|edition=2nd rev.|location=Athens|publisher=Lycabettus Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gHstAQAAIAAJ}}\n* {{cite book |last=Butler |first=Alfred |title=The Arab Conquest of Egypt and the Last Thirty Years of the Roman Dominion |url=https://archive.org/details/arabconquestofeg00butl |year=1902 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Charles|first=Robert H.|authorlink=Robert Charles (scholar)|title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu: Translated from Zotenberg's Ethiopic Text|year=2007|origyear=1916|location=Merchantville, NJ|publisher=Evolution Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgZ-DOr77OQC}}\n* {{cite book |last=Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |author-link=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=Al Farooq, Umar |year=1944 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kennedy |first=Hugh |title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live in |url=https://archive.org/details/greatarabconques00kenn_0 |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-81740-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Meyendorff|first=John|author-link=John Meyendorff|year=1989|title=Imperial unity and Christian divisions: The Church 450-680 A.D.|series=The Church in history|volume=2|location=Crestwood, NY|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6J_YAAAAMAAJ}}\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|last=Ostrogorsky|first=George|authorlink=George Ostrogorsky|year=1956|title=History of the Byzantine State|location=Oxford|publisher=Basil Blackwell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bt0_AAAAYAAJ}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite book |last=Gibbon |first=Edward |author-link=Edward Gibbon |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519211753/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/g/gibbon/edward/g43d/chapter51.html |title=History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |chapter=51}}\n* {{citation |last=Nikiou |first=Bishop John |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/nikiu2_chronicle.htm |title=The Chronicle of John, Bishop of Nikiu |chapter=CXVI\u2013CXXI}}\n\n{{Egypt topics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Muslim Conquest Of Egypt}}\n[[Category:640s conflicts]]\n[[Category:7th century in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Muslim conquest of Egypt| ]]\n[[Category:Islam in Egypt]]\n[[Category:Roman Egypt]]\n[[Category:Byzantine Empire]]\n[[Category:Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]\n", "name_user": "JimmyMJA", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed confusing (possible) grammatical mistake.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Egypt"}

According to the 2000 census, 65% of Sparta Township workers commute to jobs outside of the county. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Mining industry===\n\n====Iron====\nRobert Ogden settled in 1778 near the present town of [[Ogdensburg, New Jersey|Ogdensburg]] and built an iron forge, utilizing local ore from his Ogden Mine on Sparta Mountain.  The Horseshoe mine was opened in 1772 by the Englishmen Spargo and Harvey who shipped ore by horse and mule to the forges at Sparta and Hopewell.  It wasn't until 1868 that the [[Ogden Mine Railroad]] began operations and made it economical to ship zinc and iron ore to Nolan's Point on [[Lake Hopatcong]] where the [[Morris Canal]] had a marine terminal that could ship ore to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. In 1872, the [[New Jersey Midland Railroad]] (later known as the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway|New York, Susquehanna & Western]]) extended to Ogdensburg and captured the zinc ore traffic.\n\nIn 1836, Henry Decker, along with Nelson Hunt and Lewis Sherman, began the manufacture of anchors at their forges in Sparta.  Their success led to a small industry of forging anchors in Sparta, but by the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the forge industry in Sparta had come to an end.\n\nIn 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] invested $3.5 million in his [[Edison Ore-Milling Company]] to build iron operations on {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} of Sparta Mountain.  Edison hoped to concentrate the mountain's vast quantities of low-grade ore and supply East Coast mills with raw material.  At its peak Edison's operation employed 500 people, but after a 10 year effort he abandoned his attempt to compete with more economical ores from [[Minnesota]]'s [[Mesabi Range|Mesabi Iron Range]].  The availability of the cheap Minnesota ores put an end to iron mining in Sparta.<ref>Staff.

In 1880 the Franklin Iron Company acquired the New Jersey Zinc Company's operations at Sterling Hill mine, ending the dispute.  Large scale operations began in 1897 when the claims were consolidated under the New Jersey Zinc Company and by 1900 its mill was processing 1,500 tons of ore daily.\n\nZinc operations continued until 1986 when the Sterling Hill mine ceased operation.  The Sterling Hill mine site is currently occupied by the [[Sterling Hill Mining Museum]] and is open to the public for tours.<ref name=NYT1992/>\n\n====Limestone====\nAfter closing his iron operations, Thomas Edison recouped his losses by opening a quarry called Limecrest near Sparta in 1919.  The lime quarry fed Edison's [[Portland cement]] operations, and was in continuous operation under various owners for more than 80 years until closed in 2003.  During the years of its operation the limestone quarry was an important source of employment and tax revenue for Sparta.

According to the 2000 census, 65% of Sparta Township workers commute to jobs outside of the county. {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Mining industry===\n\n====Iron====\nRobert Ogden settled in 1778 near the present town of [[Ogdensburg, New Jersey|Ogdensburg]] and built an iron forge, utilizing local ore from his Ogden Mine on Sparta Mountain.  The Horseshoe mine was opened in 1772 by the Englishmen Spargo and Harvey who shipped ore by horse and mule to the forges at Sparta and Hopewell.  It wasn't until 1868 that the [[Ogden Mine Railroad]] began operations and made it economical to ship zinc and iron ore to Nolan's Point on [[Lake Hopatcong]] where the [[Morris Canal]] had a marine terminal that could ship ore to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]]. In 1872, the [[New Jersey Midland Railroad]] (later known as the [[New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway|New York, Susquehanna & Western]]) extended to Ogdensburg and captured the zinc ore traffic.\n\nIn 1836, Henry Decker, along with Nelson Hunt and Lewis Sherman, began the manufacture of anchors at their forges in Sparta.  Their success led to a small industry of forging anchors in Sparta, but by the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] the forge industry in Sparta had come to an end.\n\nIn 1889, [[Thomas Edison]] invested $3.5 million in his [[Edison Ore-Milling Company]] to build iron operations on {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} of Sparta Mountain.  Edison hoped to concentrate the mountain's vast quantities of low-grade ore and supply East Coast mills with raw material.  At its peak Edison's operation employed 500 people, but after a 10 year effort he abandoned his attempt to compete with more economical ores from [[Minnesota]]'s [[Mesabi Range|Mesabi Iron Range]].  The availability of the cheap Minnesota ores put an end to iron mining in Sparta.<ref>Staff.

In 1880 the Franklin Iron Company acquired the New Jersey Zinc Company's operations at Sterling Hill mine, ending the dispute.  Large scale operations began in 1897 when the claims were consolidated under the New Jersey Zinc Company and by 1900 its mill was processing 1,500 tons of ore daily.\n\nZinc operations continued until 1986 when the Sterling Hill mine ceased operation.  The Sterling Hill mine site is currently occupied by the [[Sterling Hill Mining Museum]] and is open to the public for tours.<ref name=NYT1992/>\n\n====Limestone====\nAfter closing his iron operations, Thomas Edison recouped his losses by opening a quarry called Limecrest near Sparta in 1919.  The lime quarry fed Edison's [[Portland cement]] operations, and was in continuous operation under various owners for more than 80 years until closed in 2003.  During the years of its operation the limestone quarry was an important source of employment and tax revenue for Sparta.  Limestone is no longer mined, but a limited amount of granite continues to be quarried by a handful of employees.<ref>Staff.

series, specials (including [[List of original stand-up comedy specials distributed by Netflix|stand-up comedy specials]]), miniseries and [[List of original films distributed by Netflix|documentaries and films]]. Netflix's original productions also include continuations of canceled series from other networks, as well as licensing or co-producing content from international broadcasters for exclusive broadcast in other territories, which is also branded in those regions as Netflix original content. Netflix previously produced content through [[Red Envelope Entertainment]]. Netflix's first original content series was ''[[House of Cards (American TV series)|House of Cards]]'', released in 2013. The company has since increased its original content. All programming is in English unless stated otherwise, is organized by its primary genre or format and is sorted by premiere date.\n\n==Original programming==\nThese shows had their original production commissioned by Netflix, or had additional seasons commissioned by Netflix.\n\n===Drama===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" id=\"dramashows\"\n|-\n!

This was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess-like games, and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation.  Pell then developed the system ''Metagamer''.<ref name=\":2\">[http://www.barneypell.com/games_research.html Barney Pell's research on computer game playing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812030341/http://www.barneypell.com/games_research.html |date=2007-08-12 }}.</ref> This system was able to play a number of chess-like games, given game rules definition in a special language called Game Description Language, without any human interaction once the games were generated.<ref name=\"satirist\">{{cite web|url=http://satirist.org/learn-game/projects/metagame.html|website=Metagame and General Game Playing|title=Metagame and General Game Playing|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the commercial system [[Zillions of Games]] was developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler. The system used a LISP-like language to define the game rules. Zillions of Games derived the [[evaluation function]] automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility, board structure and game goals. It also employed usual algorithms as found in [[computer chess]] systems: [[alpha-beta pruning]] with move ordering, [[transposition table]]s, etc.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.ai.games/browse_thread/thread/c3f734729a107d22/a25c735d6a0693db?&hl=en#a25c735d6a0693db  Available: Universal Game Engine] email to comp.ai.games by Jeff Mallett, 10-Dec-1998.</ref>  The package was extended in 2007 by the addition of the Axiom plug-in, an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete Forth-based programming language.\n\nIn 1998, z-Tree was developed by [[Urs Fischbacher]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UZH - z-Tree - Zurich Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments |url=https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html |website=www.ztree.uzh.ch |accessdate=17 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> z-Tree is the first and the most cited [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|software tool for experimental economics]]. z-Tree allows the definition of game rules in z-Tree-language for [[Behavioral_game_theory|game-theoretic experiments with human subjects]].

It is the most well-known effort at standardizing GGP AI, and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems. The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the [[Game Description Language]]. In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ggpserver/ GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems.</ref><ref>[http://130.208.241.192/ggpserver/ Dresden GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems with automatic scheduling of matches.</ref> that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.\n\nSince 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the [[AAAI]] Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize.<ref name=\":2\"/> So far, the following programs were victorious:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.general-game-playing.de/|title=General Game Playing|website=www.general-game-playing.de}}</ref>\n\n* 2005: Cluneplayer, by Jim Clune ([[UCLA]])\n* 2006: Fluxplayer,<ref>[http://www.general-game-playing.de/research.html Information about Fluxplayer], the winner of the 2nd International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Stephan Schiffel and Michael Thielscher ([[Dresden University of Technology]])\n* 2007: Cadiaplayer,<ref>[http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/public:cadiaplayer:main  Information about CADIAPlayer], more information about the winner of the 3rd, 4th, and 8th International General Game Playing competitions.</ref> by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson and Hilmar Finnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2008: Cadiaplayer, by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson, Hilmar Finnsson and Gylfi \u00de\u00f3r Gu\u00f0mundsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2009: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2010: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2011: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2012: Cadiaplayer, by Hilmar Finnsson and Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2013: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2014: Sancho,<ref>[http://sanchoggp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/sancho-is-ggp-champion-2014.html Sancho is GGP Champion 2014!], winner of the 2014 International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Steve Draper and Andrew Rose\n* 2015: Galvanise, by Richard Emslie\n* 2016: WoodStock, by Eric Piette ([[Artois University]])\n\n=== Other approaches ===\nThere are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules.

B.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Togelius|first3=Julian|last4=Nelson|first4=Mark J.}}</ref>\n\n===Video Game Description Language===\n\nThe '''General Video Game AI Competition''' ([http://gvgai.net/ GVGAI]) has been running since 2014. In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition. It has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the '''Video Game Description Language (VGDL)''', which should not be confused with [[Game Description Language|GDL]] and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed. One example for VGDL is PyVGDL developed in 2013.<ref name=paperschaul/><ref name=gitschaul/> The games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2-dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify.<ref name=dagstuhl/> To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in VGDL manually. VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/PLG_ASP_GVG.pdf|title=Procedural Level Generation with Answer Set Programming for General Video Game Playing|last=Neufeld|first=Xenija|last2=Mostaghim|first2=Sanaz|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Perez-Liebana|first3=Diego}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nSince GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] techniques are often most effective.\n\nA popular method for developing GGP AI is the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) algorithm.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228393769|title=Monte-Carlo Tree Search for General Game Playing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref> Often used together with the UCT method (''Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees''), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finnsson|first=Hilmar|date=2012|title=Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4935/5300|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Frydenberg2015Investigating.pdf|title=Investigating MCTS Modifications in General Video Game Playing|last=Frydenberg|first=Frederik|last2=Anderson|first2=Kasper R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Risi|first3=Sebastian|last4=Togelius|first4=Julian}}</ref><ref>M.

In the book ''Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds'', Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences.<ref>Jesper Juul. Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. MIT Press, 2005.</ref>  Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.<ref name=dagstuhl>{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial General Intelligence]]\n* [[AlphaZero]]\n* [[Game Description Language]]\n* [[Multi-task learning]]\n* [[Transfer learning]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Domain-specific entertainment language]]\n* [[Artificial intelligence (video games)]]\n* [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|Software tools for experimental economics]], since experimental economics conducts game experiments\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://logic.stanford.edu/ggp/homepage/index.php General Game Playing Home Page at Stanford University]\n:See also the [http://cs227b.stanford.edu/ CS227B - General Game Playing course page], [http://www.ggp.org/ GGP.org], [https://github.com/ggp-org GGP.org GitHub page], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235146/http://games.stanford.edu/ games.stanford.edu]. \n\n* [http://www.general-game-playing.de/ General Game Playing Resources] provided by Dresden University of Technology.\n* [http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/ AiAi by Stephen Tavener]\n* [http://www.polyomino.com/ PolyGamo Player Project by David M.

This was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess-like games, and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation.  Pell then developed the system ''Metagamer''.<ref name=\":2\">[http://www.barneypell.com/games_research.html Barney Pell's research on computer game playing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812030341/http://www.barneypell.com/games_research.html |date=2007-08-12 }}.</ref> This system was able to play a number of chess-like games, given game rules definition in a special language called Game Description Language, without any human interaction once the games were generated.<ref name=\"satirist\">{{cite web|url=http://satirist.org/learn-game/projects/metagame.html|website=Metagame and General Game Playing|title=Metagame and General Game Playing|accessdate=27 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the commercial system [[Zillions of Games]] was developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler. The system used a LISP-like language to define the game rules. Zillions of Games derived the [[evaluation function]] automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility, board structure and game goals. It also employed usual algorithms as found in [[computer chess]] systems: [[alpha-beta pruning]] with move ordering, [[transposition table]]s, etc.<ref>[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.ai.games/browse_thread/thread/c3f734729a107d22/a25c735d6a0693db?&hl=en#a25c735d6a0693db  Available: Universal Game Engine] email to comp.ai.games by Jeff Mallett, 10-Dec-1998.</ref>  The package was extended in 2007 by the addition of the Axiom plug-in, an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete Forth-based programming language.\n\nIn 1998, z-Tree was developed by [[Urs Fischbacher]].<ref>{{cite web |title=UZH - z-Tree - Zurich Toolbox for Readymade Economic Experiments |url=https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html |website=www.ztree.uzh.ch |accessdate=17 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> z-Tree is the first and the most cited [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|software tool for experimental economics]]. z-Tree allows the definition of game rules in z-Tree-language for [[Behavioral_game_theory|game-theoretic experiments with human subjects]].

It is the most well-known effort at standardizing GGP AI, and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems. The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the [[Game Description Language]]. In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server<ref>[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ggpserver/ GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems.</ref><ref>[http://130.208.241.192/ggpserver/ Dresden GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems with automatic scheduling of matches.</ref> that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.\n\nSince 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the [[AAAI]] Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize.<ref name=\":2\"/> So far, the following programs were victorious:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.general-game-playing.de/|title=General Game Playing|website=www.general-game-playing.de}}</ref>\n\n* 2005: Cluneplayer, by Jim Clune ([[UCLA]])\n* 2006: Fluxplayer,<ref>[http://www.general-game-playing.de/research.html Information about Fluxplayer], the winner of the 2nd International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Stephan Schiffel and Michael Thielscher ([[Dresden University of Technology]])\n* 2007: Cadiaplayer,<ref>[http://cadia.ru.is/wiki/public:cadiaplayer:main  Information about CADIAPlayer], more information about the winner of the 3rd, 4th, and 8th International General Game Playing competitions.</ref> by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson and Hilmar Finnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2008: Cadiaplayer, by Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson, Hilmar Finnsson and Gylfi \u00de\u00f3r Gu\u00f0mundsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2009: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2010: Ary, by Jean M\u00e9hat ([[Paris 8 University]])\n* 2011: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2012: Cadiaplayer, by Hilmar Finnsson and Yngvi Bj\u00f6rnsson ([[Reykjavik University]])\n* 2013: TurboTurtle, by Sam Schreiber\n* 2014: Sancho,<ref>[http://sanchoggp.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/sancho-is-ggp-champion-2014.html Sancho is GGP Champion 2014!], winner of the 2014 International General Game Playing competition.</ref> by Steve Draper and Andrew Rose\n* 2015: Galvanise, by Richard Emslie\n* 2016: WoodStock, by Eric Piette ([[Artois University]])\n\n=== Other approaches ===\nThere are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules.

B.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Togelius|first3=Julian|last4=Nelson|first4=Mark J.}}</ref>\n\n===Video Game Description Language===\n\nThe '''General Video Game AI Competition''' ([http://gvgai.net/ GVGAI]) has been running since 2014. In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition. It has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the '''Video Game Description Language (VGDL)''', which should not be confused with [[Game Description Language|GDL]] and is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed. One example for VGDL is PyVGDL developed in 2013.<ref name=paperschaul/><ref name=gitschaul/> The games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2-dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify.<ref name=dagstuhl/> To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in VGDL manually. VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/PLG_ASP_GVG.pdf|title=Procedural Level Generation with Answer Set Programming for General Video Game Playing|last=Neufeld|first=Xenija|last2=Mostaghim|first2=Sanaz|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Perez-Liebana|first3=Diego}}</ref>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n\nSince GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] techniques are often most effective.\n\nA popular method for developing GGP AI is the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) algorithm.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228393769|title=Monte-Carlo Tree Search for General Game Playing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-01}}</ref> Often used together with the UCT method (''Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees''), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finnsson|first=Hilmar|date=2012|title=Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4935/5300|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Frydenberg2015Investigating.pdf|title=Investigating MCTS Modifications in General Video Game Playing|last=Frydenberg|first=Frederik|last2=Anderson|first2=Kasper R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Risi|first3=Sebastian|last4=Togelius|first4=Julian}}</ref><ref>M.

In the book ''Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds'', Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences.<ref>Jesper Juul. Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. MIT Press, 2005.</ref>  Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.<ref name=dagstuhl>{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Artificial General Intelligence]]\n* [[AlphaZero]]\n* [[Game Description Language]]\n* [[Multi-task learning]]\n* [[Transfer learning]]\n* [[Outline of artificial intelligence]]\n* [[Domain-specific entertainment language]]\n* [[Artificial intelligence (video games)]]\n* [[Experimental_economics#Software_tools|Software tools for experimental economics]], since experimental economics conducts game experiments\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://logic.stanford.edu/ggp/homepage/index.php General Game Playing Home Page at Stanford University]\n:See also the [http://cs227b.stanford.edu/ CS227B - General Game Playing course page], [http://www.ggp.org/ GGP.org], [https://github.com/ggp-org GGP.org GitHub page], and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235146/http://games.stanford.edu/ games.stanford.edu]. \n\n* [http://www.general-game-playing.de/ General Game Playing Resources] provided by Dresden University of Technology.\n* [http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/ AiAi by Stephen Tavener]\n* [http://www.polyomino.com/ PolyGamo Player Project by David M.

The first entry in the series, ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'', was released in 2001; since then, five further main series games, as well as various spin-offs and high-definition remasters for newer game consoles, have been released. Additionally, the series has seen adaptations in the form of [[Ace Attorney (film)|a live action film]] and [[Ace Attorney (TV series)|an anime]], and has been the base for [[manga]] series, [[drama CD]]s, [[Musical theatre|musicals]] and [[stage play]]s.\n\nThe player takes the roles of various defense attorneys, including [[Phoenix Wright (character)|Phoenix Wright]], his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, and investigates cases and defends their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor. In the spin-off series ''Ace Attorney Investigations'', the player takes the role of prosecutor [[Miles Edgeworth]], and in the spin-off ''[[Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhod\u014d Ry\u016bnosuke no B\u014dken|Dai Gyakuten Saiban]]'', they play as Phoenix's ancestor Ry\u016bnosuke Naruhod\u014d.\n\nThe series was created by the writer and director [[Shu Takumi]]. He wanted the series to end after the third game, but it continued, with Takeshi Yamazaki taking over as writer and director starting with ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth]]'' (2009); Takumi has since returned to write and direct some spin-off titles. While the original Japanese versions of the games are set in Japan, the series' [[Video game localization|localizations]] are set in the United States, though retaining Japanese cultural influence. The series has been well received, with reviewers liking the characters and story, and the finding of contradictions; it has also performed well commercially, with Capcom regarding it as one of their strongest intellectual properties. The series has been credited with helping to popularise visual novels in the Western world.

This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed, such as changing Maya's favorite food from ramen to burgers.

{{nihongo|'''''Gyakuten Saiban'''''|\u9006\u8ee2\u88c1\u5224||lead=yes|lit. ''Turnabout Trial''}}}} is a series of [[adventure video game]]s developed by [[Capcom]]. The first entry in the series, ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'', was released in 2001; since then, five further main series games, as well as various spin-offs and high-definition remasters for newer game consoles, have been released. Additionally, the series has seen adaptations in the form of [[Ace Attorney (film)|a live action film]] and [[Ace Attorney (TV series)|an anime]], and has been the base for [[manga]] series, [[drama CD]]s, [[Musical theatre|musicals]] and [[stage play]]s.\n\nThe player takes the roles of various defense attorneys, including [[Phoenix Wright (character)|Phoenix Wright]], his mentor Mia Fey, and his understudies Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes, and investigates cases and defends their clients in court; they find the truth by cross-examining witnesses and finding inconsistencies between the testimonies and the evidence they have collected. The cases all last a maximum of three days, with the judge determining the outcome based on evidence presented by the defense attorney and the prosecutor. In the spin-off series ''Ace Attorney Investigations'', the player takes the role of prosecutor [[Miles Edgeworth]], and in the spin-off ''[[Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhod\u014d Ry\u016bnosuke no B\u014dken|Dai Gyakuten Saiban]]'', they play as Phoenix's ancestor Ry\u016bnosuke Naruhod\u014d.\n\nThe series was created by the writer and director [[Shu Takumi]]. He wanted the series to end after the third game, but it continued, with Takeshi Yamazaki taking over as writer and director starting with ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth]]'' (2009); Takumi has since returned to write and direct some spin-off titles. While the original Japanese versions of the games are set in Japan, the series' [[Video game localization|localizations]] are set in the United States, though retaining Japanese cultural influence. The series has been well received, with reviewers liking the characters and story, and the finding of contradictions; it has also performed well commercially, with Capcom regarding it as one of their strongest intellectual properties. The series has been credited with helping to popularise visual novels in the Western world. As of December 2019, the game series has sold 7.3 million units worldwide.\n\n==Titles==\n{{VG timeline\n| 2001 = ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]''\n| 2002 = ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2212 Justice for All]]''\n| 2004 = ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2212 Trials and Tribulations]]''\n| 2007 = ''[[Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney]]''\n| 2009 = ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations 2]]''\n| 2012 = ''[[Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2212 Dual Destinies]]''\n| 2015 = ''[[Dai Gyakuten Saiban: Naruhod\u014d Ry\u016bnosuke no B\u014dken]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney \u2212 Spirit of Justice]]''\n| 2017  = ''[[Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhod\u014d Ry\u016bnosuke no Kakugo]]''\n}}\n\nThe ''Ace Attorney'' series launched in Japan with the [[Game Boy Advance]] game ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'' in 2001, and has been published in the West since the release of a [[Nintendo DS]] port in 2005.<ref name=\"ann anime staff\"/> The series currently consists of six main series games and five spin-offs.<ref name=\"sil aa6 3ds ja\"/><ref name=\"fam dgs1 3ds\"/><ref name=\"fam aai1 nds\"/><ref name=\"fam aai2 nds\"/><ref name=\"fam plvsaa 3ds\"/><ref name=\"sil aa6 3ds naeu\"/><ref name=\"dgs2 rel\"/> Additionally, two titles that collect the first three main series games have been released: ''Ace Attorney: Phoenix Wright Trilogy HD'', which was released for iOS and Android in 2012 in Japan and for iOS in 2013 in the West,<ref name=\"fam tri ios\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/android/gt/ |title=Android\u7248\u300e\u9006\u8ee2\u88c1\u5224 123HD\u300f\u914d\u4fe1\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |language=Japanese |publisher=[[Capcom]] |access-date=October 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001161834/http://www.capcom.co.jp/android/gt/ |archive-date=October 1, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"kot tri ios\"/> and ''Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy'', which was released for the [[Nintendo 3DS]] in 2014,<ref name=\"fam tri 3ds\"/><ref name=\"pol tri 3ds\"/> and [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/22/17889708/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-pc-ps4-nintendo-switch-xbox-one-release-date |title=Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy coming to PC, PS4, Switch, Xbox One |author=McWhertor, Michael |date=September 22, 2019 |website=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |access-date=September 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922092644/https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/22/17889708/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-pc-ps4-nintendo-switch-xbox-one-release-date |archive-date=September 22, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Main series===\n# ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'' is the first entry in the series.

he avoided making a lot of changes between games: art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in

She came up with the idea that the localized versions of the ''Ace Attorney'' games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the [[California Alien Land Law of 1913]] were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed, such as changing Maya's favorite food from ramen to burgers. That particular change was mocked by players as the dish later became more well known in the West, and was lampshaded in the English release of ''Spirit of Justice'', where Maya is described as liking both ramen and burgers.<ref name=\"capcom-unity tidbits\"/><ref name=\"capcom-unity localization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom-unity.com/zeroobjections/blog/2014/11/21/localization-and-ace-attorney |title=Localization and Ace Attorney |author=Hsu, Janet |date=November 20, 2014 |publisher=[[Capcom]] |access-date=October 2, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915232234/http://www.capcom-unity.com/zeroobjections/blog/2014/11/21/localization-and-ace-attorney |archivedate=September 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nCharacter names were also localized to use double meanings similarly to the Japanese names;<ref name=\"nintendo wright track\"/> the name puns were based on the characters' personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags.<ref name=\"sil lawyers localization\">{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/01/18/on-lawyers-and-localization-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-justice-for-all-interview/ |title=On Lawyers and Localization, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney: Justice for All interview |author=Spencer |date=January 18, 2007 |publisher=Siliconera |access-date=October 2, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123507/http://www.siliconera.com/2007/01/18/on-lawyers-and-localization-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-justice-for-all-interview/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Several English names were based on their Japanese counterparts, but for some characters the names had to be altered heavily compared to the Japanese versions.<ref name=\"nintendo wright track\"/> Smith and Anderson had a lot of freedom when localizing the names of minor characters in the first game, but discussed the names of the main cast with Capcom.

Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of [[molecular vibration]]s, including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring.\n\nBarry Allen's classic stories introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] to DC Comics, and this concept played a large part in DC's various [[reboot (fiction)|continuity reboots]] over the years. The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC's major company-wide reboot stories, and in the crossover ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #8 (Nov. 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse, removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative (and a single image of a blur) in [[Grant Morrison]]'s crossover story ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #3 (Nov. 2008), fully actualized in [[Geoff Johns]]' accompanying ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' #1 (June 2009), kicking off a six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009), [[Flashpoint (comics)|''Flashpoint'']] (2011), [[Convergence (comics)|''Convergence'']] (2015), and ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' (2016).\n\nAllen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash, being present in numerous media adaptations, one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes.\n\nBarry Allen has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' and then in the related ''[[Super Friends]]'' program. Since then he has appeared in several [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]. Actor [[John Wesley Shipp]] portrayed the character in the live-action 1990s television show ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and the [[Arrowverse]]. Allen is currently portrayed by [[Grant Gustin]] in the [[Arrowverse]] shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', while [[Ezra Miller]] portrays the character in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|''Crisis on Infinite Earths'']] and the [[DC Extended Universe]] films ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']], and will return in the 2022 film ''The Flash''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Showcase''#4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash. Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]Barry Allen is a police [[scientist]] (his job was later changed to a forensic investigator) with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc\u00e9e, [[Iris West]]. When Barry was a child, his mother was murdered, and Barry's father was unjustly blamed. It was actually the [[Reverse-Flash]]. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original [[Fawcett Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), and becomes [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]'s resident costumed crime fighter and protector.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCentral City University professor Ira West (Iris's adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Bates, Cary|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 267|Date = November 1978|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise [[time travel]] and was used in many stories. Allen was warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much to the extent that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. [[Batman]] once said \"Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.\"<ref>''Justice'' #8 (Dec. 2006)</ref>\n\n===Justice League===\nAs presented in ''Justice League of America'' #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, the heroes decide to establish the [[Justice League]].\n\nDuring the years, he is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to [[Black Canary]] and [[Zatanna]], but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], which would later be the subject of the limited series ''Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold''.\n\nIn ''The Flash'' # 123\u2014\"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\"\u2014Allen is transported to [[Earth-Two]] where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on [[Earth-One]]. This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of ''Flash'' and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the [[Justice Society of America]] of Earth-Two. In the classic story from ''Flash'' #179\u2014\"The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Fact or Fiction?\"\u2014Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called [[Earth Prime]], a representation of \"our\" universe, where he seeks the aid of the ''Flash'' comic book's editor [[Julius Schwartz]] to build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Iris' nephew, [[Wally West]], who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers.\n\n===Tragedy===\nIn time, he married his girlfriend Iris West, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept this secret, and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno's persuasion.<ref>''The Flash'' #174</ref> Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.\n\nIn the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse.  [[Professor Zoom]] (a [[supervillain]] from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fianc\u00e9e eventually descends into madness and  stomps \nout of the room walking in somber.\n\nPlaced on trial for murder in connection with Zoom's death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash's good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris' spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of ''The Flash'' ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption \"And they lived happily ever after... for a while\". There are a few references in the final issue (''The Flash'' #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash's impending death.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the controversial storyline ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (sets within the post-''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' continuity), it is revealed that Barry voted to allow [[Zatanna]] to edit [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]]'s mind with four of the members of the Justice League six months after Iris's death, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, they have his memories edited as well despite the opposition from [[Green Arrow]]. Both Doctor Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe, leading Doctor Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman's distrust towards his allies.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A Flash's death (Crisis on Infinite Earths).png|thumb|right|250px|Barry heroically sacrificing himself to stop the Anti-Monitor; however, it is later retconned that he actually still alive but trapped in the Speed Force following the battle. Art by [[George Perez]] from ''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' #8 (November 1985).]] -->\nFollowing the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. After only a few weeks of happiness, the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' intervenes, and Allen is captured by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the [[Speed Force]], the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, Kid Flash [[Wally West]], his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|Title = [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 12|Date = March 1986|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====After death====\n[[Marv Wolfman]], scribe for the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original ''Crisis'' collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced, without a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], into DC Universe continuity.<ref>[http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q&A.html ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128175053/http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q%26A.html |date=January 28, 2006 }}</ref> This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others.\n\nIt should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have \"died\" in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon. After this act, according to ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/wheres-barry.html |title=Where's Barry?

His spirit seems to still be alive within the Speed Force, along with [[Max Mercury]] and other speedsters.\n\nIn [[Quasar (comics)|''Quasar'']] by [[Marvel Comics]], released between December 1990 and May 1994, an amnesiac Barry Allen, misremembering his name as \"Buried Alien\" and the [[Speed Force]] as the \"Hyperforce\", and surprised to have \"form\" again, enters the [[Marvel Universe]] in the middle of the great race to be the \"Fastest Man Alive\" after the players had passed the first warp junction, where he is discovered by the Runner co-ordinating it and invited to participate in his great race. Beating several other speedsters ([[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro \"Quicksilver\" Maximoff]], [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)| Wendell \"Quasar\" Vaughn]], [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Robert \"The Whizzer\" Frank]], [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|James \"Speed Demon\" Sanders]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Ariana \"Black Racer\"]], [[Super Sabre (comics)|Martin \"Super Sabre\" Fletcher]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]]) he is declared to be the \"fastest man alive\", a title he believes feels \"right\", though he never recovers his memory during his time in the universe. He later adopted the alias \"FastForward\", before he is returned to his original universe with Makkari's assistance.\n\n===Legacy===\nIris is pregnant, and she has two children who have super-speed powers, the [[Tornado Twins]], who later meet the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire [[XS (comics)|XS]], while the other, [[Bart Allen]], is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of [[Max Mercury]], and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the [[Teen Titans]]. [[One Year Later|One year]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marc Guggenheim|Guggenheim, Marc]]|Title = The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive|Volume = 1|Issue = 13|Date = August 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Wally then retook the identity of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 2 (1987-2006, 2007-2008)|All_Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = September 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Bart would later be resurrected as Kid Flash by the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 31st century to combat [[Superboy-Prime]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nBarry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing, along with Hal Jordan. When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] shows the heroes how reality should be, but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and [[Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)|Kyle Rayner]], in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], he is ordered by [[Captain America]] to find ways through Krona's defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from being killed when the [[Absorbing Man]] breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by [[Dreamslayer]]. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America's suggestion they laid low and because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona's machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him, then Barry takes the 12 items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis'' appearances===\nWally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time\u2014stating that he is from a period shortly before his death\u2014counseling his nephew, and talking the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry's identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his \"own\" Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved [[Eobard Thawne]] from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and breaking his enemy's neck in his timeline.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nIn the fourth issue of ''Infinite Crisis'', Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]], to help his grandson Bart deal with [[Superboy-Prime]], taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more.\n\nIn ''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before ''Infinite Crisis'' #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate [[Keystone City]] along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.\n\n===Return===\n[[Image:Barry Return.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen returns to the DC Universe, fleeing from the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]].

As the story progresses, he begins to recall his past and association with [[Justice League]] members, particularly [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Superman]]. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking \"I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism\". Yet he is still the only one able to see \"the shadow falling over everything\", in the form of [[Darkseid]]. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks \"and now I remember\". The title of the story is revealed to be \"Let There Be Lightning\".<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] and [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = DC Universe Zero|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co-writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating, \"When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |title=Entertainment/Arts 2008-04-30 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204145213/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\n{{Main|Final Crisis}}\nBarry makes his [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] return in ''Final Crisis'' #2.

Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion's death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Giganta]], who have all been transformed into the new [[Female Furies]] following the release of the [[Anti-Life Equation]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = July 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry's expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth.\n\nBarry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation.

When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, \"All of them.\"\n\nThe series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, \"Central City's Flash\", [[Wonder Woman]] having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the [[Flash Museum]] and from his friend [[Hal Jordan]] is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. \"I can't be late,\" he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, \"For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.\"\n\nIt is then revealed that Flash's mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as \"the only one open case I left behind.\" Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar's shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, \"...You were the beginning, Allen...and you're the end.\" At that moment, [[Wally West]], West's children Iris and Jai, [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning.<ref name=\"TFR1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry's conflict with the speed cult{{clarify|date=September 2011}} culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar's death.

Max attempts to tell Allen that his becoming the Black Flash is not his fault. When Max and Barry are pulled into another pocket of the Speed Force, the real culprit reveals himself: [[Professor Zoom]].<ref name=\"TFR3\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = June 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nZoom reveals his plan: after Barry briefly aided Kid Flash against Superboy-Prime during the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Thawne was able to send a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to draw back what was left of Barry's self-awareness. This led to the hero's reappearance during the ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into \"a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom.<ref name=\"TFR4\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nThe seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away. He reveals that everything horrible that happened to Barry, including the murder of Barry's mother, was caused by Zoom.

They reach Thawne, becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.<ref name=\"TFR6\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 6|Date = February 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\n[[Image:Blue Lantern Flash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen as a member of the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event.

Allen appears alongside Jordan in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue ''Blackest Night'' #0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover.\n\nAt the grave of [[Bruce Wayne]] in [[Gotham City]], Hal and Barry reflect on Batman's death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman.\n\nThis reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's death engendered in others while Hal's death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \"'''I''' died a '''sinner'''. '''''You''''' died a '''saint'''.\" (though he admits he's not and reflecting of his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming \"more dangerous\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths of [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] cost the [[Justice League]] its \"heart and soul\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them. He specifically cites Batman noting, \"If there's an escape, you can bet Batman's already planning it.\"<ref name=\"BlackestNight0\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 0|Date = May 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry also appears alongside Hal in the July issues of ''Green Lantern'' tying into the event. Recently, in a fight with [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] [[J'onn J'onzz]], he found a mysterious black residue at Bruce Wayne's grave\u2014a black form coagulating much like blood that started corrupting him by partly decaying his skin and muscle during the fight against his former friend, who is intent on killing both Hal and Barry, seeing how they both died, and in the eyes of the Black Lanterns, must return to that state to keep the universe in balance.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = July 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref><ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]|Volume = 4|Issue = 44|Date = July 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nAfter fighting off the undead Martian and the subsequent Black Lanterns with Hal and the arriving [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Atom]], [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and two of the [[Indigo Tribe]] members, Barry, along with Wally and Bart, races across the globe to warn every superhero community across the planet.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Blackest Night]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> His message also inadvertently warns the Rogues.

Barry decides to go to [[Gorilla City]] to seek aid from its ruler [[Solovar]], unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before.

Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and an ability of flight (possibly because of the understanding with Hal's ring), as he is able to create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him in order to make him feel again. Barry's plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past and the constructs begin to attempt to take the black ring from him, but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar.

After the events of ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. Under the cover of having been in [[witness protection]], Allen returns to the Central City Police Department's crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash. While readjusting to life as the Flash, a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the [[Mirror Master]], and promptly dies on the street.\n\nWhen Barry arrives on the scene to investigate, he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder, or the current Rogue, Evan McCulloch. Hearing of another portal appearing, Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate. When he arrives, a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues, called ''[[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]]'' appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century, and that he is under arrest for murdering the \"Mirror Monarch\". Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone, to which their leader, \"Commander Cold\", tells him, \"Not yet. But you will.\"<ref name=\"vol3no1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 3|Issue = 1|Date = April 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief struggle, where Weather Warlock's time disc was damaged, the Renegades were forced back to the 25th century, which also caused the destruction of an apartment building due to their uncontrolled jump back. Barry saves everyone in the building, even rebuilding the building in minutes, and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch. He is attacked again by the Renegades, but only before Captain Boomerang shows up, now wielding explosive energy boomerangs. Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up.\n\nThe Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says \"In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass\". An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris's death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to \"Throw the Boomerang\", Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees.\n\nIn the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, \"Where are the Mirror Lords?\" He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris.\n\nThe story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit)<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #8 (November 2010)</ref> moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance.\n\nIn a ''Green Lantern'' storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], after he joins Hal Jordan's quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity's attacks due to his fear for Jordan's safety.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #59 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear.\n\nDC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that ''Flash'' #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn.\n\n====''Flashpoint''====\n{{Main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAs the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]] leading their respective nations in a war, his wife [[Iris West]] is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of [[Batman]], driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is [[Thomas Wayne]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects [[Professor Zoom]]'s costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nBarry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas' advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry's super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry's injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of \"Project: Superman\" that is 'raising' Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman's frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman's underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman's powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #3 (July 2011)</ref>\n\nWhile they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry's memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the [[Marvel Family]] and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref> Professor Zoom reveals to him that the \"Flashpoint\" timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he's done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears [[Pandora (DC Comics)|a voice]] explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the \"Flashpoint\" before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.<ref name=\"fp5\">''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nDC Comics relaunched ''The Flash'' with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, [[The New 52]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |title=DC Comics Solicitations for September, 2011 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 13, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928144827/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |title=Flash Reboot Creative Team: Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato |publisher=SpeedForceOrg |date=June 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817004046/http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 }}</ref> As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine broke through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him.\n\nIn the second issue of the new ''[[Justice League]]'' title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and \"opening shot\" of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]] in wrangling an out-of-control [[Superman]], and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of [[Darkseid]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]| inker= Williams, Scott| story= Justice League Part Two| title= Justice League| volume= 2| issue= 2| date= December 2011}}</ref> In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker [[Patty Spivot]].

The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority.\n\nBarry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched ''Justice League'' series, making his debut in the series' second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nDuring [[DC Rebirth]], Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that [[Wally West]] has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crisis, the [[Doctor Manhattan|unknown entity]] used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \"lightning rod\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref> Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and [[Wallace West (DC comics)|Wallace]], Iris had glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well.  Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> To make matters worse for Barry, while he's entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative-Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control.\n\nAfter gotten rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates with the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed's help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, he discusses about him telling Iris that he's alive and existed. While he's rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole.\n\nAfter defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry place him under watch at the Sanctuary while he's moving with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier's broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBarry Allen has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] described as faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]].  ''Flash'' #150, \"straining every muscle\", he ran at ten times the speed of light.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fox, Gardner|Title = Flash|Volume = 1|Issue = 150|Date = February 1965|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> However, when he pushed himself further (during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fleming, Robert Loren|Title = Secret Origins Annual|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = December 1988|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> This was later [[retcon]]ned in ''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1, where Barry stated that he \"ran into the [[Speed Force]]\", and that, \"When he stopped the [[Anti-Monitor]], when [he] ran into the \"Speed Force\" and joined it, it was like shedding [his] identity.\"<ref name=\"TFR1\" /> Allen possesses abilities that original Flash [[Jay Garrick]] has not always been able to duplicate, and most notably the ability to \"vibrate\" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in [[time travel]] by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed also allows him, in certain circumstances, to \"vibrate\" between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'', using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of [[Darkseid]]'s mind control.<ref name=\"FinalCrisis4\" />\n\nBarry's speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through \"speed-reading\", he can absorb large amounts of information into his [[short-term memory]], which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)</ref> The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 4) #2 (December 2011)</ref> Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a [[metahuman]]: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.<ref>''Superman'' #7 (2012)</ref><ref>''Voodoo'' #7 (2012)</ref>\n\n==Rogues gallery==\n{{Main|Rogues (comics)}}\nThe Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains. Their number includes (but is not limited to) several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], disdaining the use of the term \"[[supervillain]]\" or \"super-criminal\". These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods.\n\n==Other versions==\n* Barry Allen is a supporting character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He has been kept by [[Lex Luthor]] as a power source for most of the East Coast, constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or else Iris will be executed. After being rescued, Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman's young assistants deemed as \"old\"\u2014\"Kids, these days, can't tell the difference between just plain old and classic\", he mutters. He then aids [[Batman]] and other heroes in restoring order, though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long-term strategy.\n* Barry Allen appears in ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' as a scientist working with [[Superman]] and a consortium of early twentieth-century scientists such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. His uniform incorporates the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] look with the [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]-style helmet worn by Jay Garrick.\n* In ''League of Justice'', a ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''-type story, Barry is recast as \"Phaeton\", who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash's lightning-bolt chest emblem, and has bathed in dragon's blood in order to protect himself from speed friction.\n* In ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', Barry is one of a number of [[metahuman]]s imprisoned by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] state, discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government. He then shows Batman some of the attempts to recreate his powers in others, ranging from a man who cannot control his ability to vibrate to a woman whose brain operates at lightspeed while her body is still at normal speed or a man rapidly aging to death. While Barry and Batman are able to defeat the brainwashed [[Zatanna]], Barry is then killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running.\n* A version of Barry Allen aka '''Hot Pursuit''' appeared in the lead into [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]].<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #6 (January 2011)</ref> Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit, or how he came to be. The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint. Hot Pursuit's history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.<ref name=autogenerated2>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011)</ref>\n[[Image:Quasar1.png|thumb|upright|\"'''Buried Alien'''\"]]\n* A story in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'', written four years after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has the [[Marvel Universe]] speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]]. The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon. During the race, a surge of energy hits the track, leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots. This being has no memory, but an enormous desire to run. He goes on to win the race, passing Marvel speedsters such as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] in the process. When asked what his name is, the man replies, \"I'm not sure. \"Buried Alien\"... Something like that.\" When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive, he replied, \"It feels... right.\"<ref>Quasar #17, December 199</ref> The racer goes on to take the name Fast-Forward, disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], who is stuck at hyper speed.<ref>Quasar #58, May 1994</ref>\n* In the Elseworlds tale ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Barry's life is still the same, but heroes age in real time. This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening, so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008.\n* The Elseworlds story ''Flashpoint'' shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956, the year he first appeared in comics. He is more involved in government affairs. By 1963, he has ended the [[Cold War]] and pushed the [[communism|communists]] out of [[Vietnam]]. However, his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at [[John F. Kennedy]]. He is paralyzed from the neck down, but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries. By 1988, he and [[Vandal Savage|Vandal Savage's]] Immortality, Inc. have begun an exploration of [[Mars]]. In 1998, Wally West leads an expedition to Mars, during which he finds the flashpoint, an object which killed all life on Mars. Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen. Barry makes contact with [[Wally West|Wally]], who is going on a super speed rampage. Barry is cured and defeats Savage. He then enters the flashpoint, going into the [[Speed Force]].\n* In ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]] Annual'' #7, an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash, he became a superstar celebrity. However, Barry was tragically killed while battling [[Captain Cold]]. Ten years later, Wally is now a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] and Captain Cold has written a supposedly \"true\" story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent. Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen. The resulting film is a success.\n* The Barry Allen of [[Earth-51]], where [[secret identity|secret identities]] are no longer needed by superheroes, is seen alive. He is subsequently killed by the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] of New Earth.\n* In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later. In lieu of Superboy's adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Flash visited the 30th Century instead. Barry Allen of ''The Nail'' is almost identical to the pre-Crisis Earth-1 version, except that his costume resembles Wally's. His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with [[Amazo]] where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack.\n* In the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' Barry joins Superman's Regime in a more forceful approach to saving the world from crime. However, Barry remains one of the few (alongside Shazam) to maintain some sense of morality, as he is more prone to questioning some of Superman's more drastic actions in the Year One series. Though Batman tries to convince Barry of the Regime's negative influence, he chooses to stay with them, though still tries to convince Superman his more drastic actions will not go down well. In the game, Barry finally defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam for questioning his ethics. He joins the Insurgency and plays a critical role in stopping Superman's dictatorship. While he and the other Regime members are arrested, he is pardoned thanks to Batman vouching for him and given a job at Luthor/Wayne climate research. His superior, Doctor Randall, convinces Barry to become the Flash again to aid the heroes in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s invasion.\n* A version of Barry Allen is present through ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''. This version hails from Earth-Minus-52 of the Dark Multiverse, where Batman became mad due to the deaths of his crimefighting sidekicks. Batman manages to absorb Barry's body, taking the Speed Force for himself and calling himself \"'''Red Death'''\"; however Barry's mind remains present in Bruce's body, pleading Bruce to stop his dark crusade. When Red Death is hit by the positive energy, Bruce dies, leaving Barry alive and in control of his body, with the costume changing its color from red to gold. Barry tries his best to help his counterpart from Earth-0. However, because Barry from Earth-Minus-52 is a \"creature of darkness\", the exposure to the positive energy starts to rip him apart, killing him almost instantly.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Film===\n====DC Extended Universe====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:EzraFlash.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ezra Miller]] as Barry Allen/The Flash in 2017 film, ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.]]\n[[Ezra Miller]] portrays Barry Allen/The Flash in the DCEU.

When Bruce contacts Barry and offers him membership of the team, Barry accepts, a conversation with his father forcing Barry to face the idea that he needs friends, but finding it hard to interact with other people because of his speed.

In the alternate reality, Flash is one of the heroes serving in [[Superman]]'s Regime, although he has doubts about Superman's true intentions. After Superman kills [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] when the latter questions his plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham City to show humanity that he is 'needed', the Flash realizes that the heroes have officially gone too far and defects to [[Batman]]'s Insurgency. After the original Superman deposes the Regime, Barry surrenders himself due to his previous alliance with the Regime, but is assured by [[Green Arrow]] that his help in their defeat will be mentioned at the Regime's trial. In Flash's ending, he defeats Superman but is still overcome with guilt for his actions with the Regime and goes into exile. To make amends, he retakes his superhero mantle and begins fighting crime relentlessly in Central City where he is referred to as \"The Ghost\".\n* He returns as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', now with [[Taliesin Jaffe]] reprising his role from ''MK vs DC''. In the story, Flash has been pardoned from prison in recognition of his aid in deposing Superman's regime, and now seeks to make amends for his time as a regime member. In his playable chapter, Flash single-handedly defends Metropolis from Brainiac's initial attack and briefly comes to blows with Hal Jordan, who is trying to atone for his misdeeds as a Regime partisan, much like Flash himself. The two put their differences aside and join Batman's Insurgency. After Brainiac is defeated, he sides with Batman on allowing Brainiac to live so the captured and lost cities could be restored. Flash attempts to stop an enraged Superman but is easily defeated. In his arcade mode ending, Flash throws Brainiac into the end of time and enters the Speed Force, where he is reunited with other speedsters.

Various other effects are also attributed to his ability to control the speed of [[molecular vibration]]s, including his ability to vibrate at speed to pass through objects. The Flash wears a distinct red and gold costume treated to resist friction and wind resistance, traditionally storing the costume compressed inside a ring.\n\nBarry Allen's classic stories introduced the concept of the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] to DC Comics, and this concept played a large part in DC's various [[reboot (fiction)|continuity reboots]] over the years. The Flash has traditionally always had a significant role in DC's major company-wide reboot stories, and in the crossover ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' #8 (Nov. 1985), Barry Allen died saving the Multiverse, removing the character from the regular DC lineup for 23 years. His return to regular comics is foreshadowed during the narrative (and a single image of a blur) in [[Grant Morrison]]'s crossover story ''[[Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge]]'' #3 (Nov. 2008), fully actualized in [[Geoff Johns]]' accompanying ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'' #1 (June 2009), kicking off a six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]. He has since played a pivotal role in the crossover stories ''[[Blackest Night]]'' (2009), [[Flashpoint (comics)|''Flashpoint'']] (2011), [[Convergence (comics)|''Convergence'']] (2015), and ''[[DC Rebirth]]'' (2016).\n\nAllen is the most well-known and commonly featured individual to take the mantle of the Flash, being present in numerous media adaptations, one-shots and comic-book story-arcs taking place in alternate universes.\n\nBarry Allen has been featured in several media, first appearing in animated form in the 1967 ''[[The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure]]'' and then in the related ''[[Super Friends]]'' program. Since then he has appeared in several [[DC Universe Animated Original Movies]]. Actor [[John Wesley Shipp]] portrayed the character in the live-action 1990s television show ''[[The Flash (1990 TV series)|The Flash]]'' and the [[Arrowverse]]. Allen is currently portrayed by [[Grant Gustin]] in the [[Arrowverse]] shows in a main capacity, especially the 2014 television series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', while [[Ezra Miller]] portrays the character in [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|''Crisis on Infinite Earths'']] and the [[DC Extended Universe]] films ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', [[Justice League (film)|''Justice League'']], and will return in the 2022 film ''The Flash''.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n[[File:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|right|upright|''Showcase''#4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash. Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]Barry Allen is a police [[scientist]] (his job was later changed to a forensic investigator) with a reputation for being very slow, and frequently late, which frustrates his fianc\u00e9e, [[Iris West]]. When Barry was a child, his mother was murdered, and Barry's father was unjustly blamed. It was actually the [[Reverse-Flash]]. One night, as he is working late on a new case, a lightning bolt strikes and shatters a case full of unspecified chemicals and drenches all over Barry, temporarily knocking him out. As a result, Allen later finds that he can run at super-human speeds and possesses equally enhanced reflexes, senses, and healing. He later dons a red bodysuit, sporting a lightning bolt in the chest (reminiscent of the original [[Fawcett Comics]] [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]), dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood comic book hero, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), and becomes [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]'s resident costumed crime fighter and protector.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nCentral City University professor Ira West (Iris's adoptive father) designed Allen's costume and the ring which stores it while Allen is in his civilian identity.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Bates, Cary|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 267|Date = November 1978|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> The ring can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit. In addition, Allen invented the cosmic treadmill, a device that allowed for precise [[time travel]] and was used in many stories. Allen was warmly received by his superhero colleagues, so much to the extent that nearly all speedsters that come after him are often compared to him. [[Batman]] once said \"Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents had not been murdered.\"<ref>''Justice'' #8 (Dec. 2006)</ref>\n\n===Justice League===\nAs presented in ''Justice League of America'' #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces, Allen among them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards, the heroes decide to establish the [[Justice League]].\n\nDuring the years, he is depicted as feeling slightly attracted to [[Black Canary]] and [[Zatanna]], but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West, whom he ultimately marries. Allen also becomes a good friend with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], which would later be the subject of the limited series ''Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold''.\n\nIn ''The Flash'' # 123\u2014\"[[Flash of Two Worlds]]\"\u2014Allen is transported to [[Earth-Two]] where he meets Jay Garrick, the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on [[Earth-One]]. This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of ''Flash'' and in team-ups between the Justice League of America of Earth-One and the [[Justice Society of America]] of Earth-Two. In the classic story from ''Flash'' #179\u2014\"The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Fact or Fiction?\"\u2014Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called [[Earth Prime]], a representation of \"our\" universe, where he seeks the aid of the ''Flash'' comic book's editor [[Julius Schwartz]] to build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home. He also gains a sidekick and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in Iris' nephew, [[Wally West]], who gains super-speed in an accident similar to that which gave Allen his powers.\n\n===Tragedy===\nIn time, he married his girlfriend Iris West, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept this secret, and he eventually revealed his identity to her of his own free will with Moreno's persuasion.<ref>''The Flash'' #174</ref> Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.\n\nIn the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse.  [[Professor Zoom]] (a [[supervillain]] from the 25th century who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, when Barry is unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fianc\u00e9e eventually descends into madness and  stomps \nout of the room walking in somber.\n\nPlaced on trial for murder in connection with Zoom's death, Allen is found guilty by the jury. When he is told by a juror Nathan Newbury, who is being possessed by a mind from the future, that Reverse-Flash (whom Allen knows to be dead) brainwashed the jury into this verdict, Flash flees his trial. The Flash is then attacked by Reverse-Flash, and realizes that the answers to this mystery, and restoring his good name, lie in the future, so Newbury uses a time device to send them forward. They discover that [[Abra Kadabra (comics)|Abra Kadabra]] was disguised as Reverse-Flash to ruin the Flash's good name. Defeating Kadabra, he retreats to the future to be reunited with Iris, having learned that Iris' spirit was in fact drawn to the 30th century, and given a new body (and was in fact the mind inhabiting Newbury). The final issue of ''The Flash'' ends with Flash and Iris kissing passionately and the caption \"And they lived happily ever after... for a while\". There are a few references in the final issue (''The Flash'' #350) to the upcoming events, and Flash's impending death.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/>\n\nIn the controversial storyline ''[[Identity Crisis (DC Comics)|Identity Crisis]]'' (sets within the post-''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time|Zero Hour]]'' continuity), it is revealed that Barry voted to allow [[Zatanna]] to edit [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Doctor Light]]'s mind with four of the members of the Justice League six months after Iris's death, essentially lobotomizing him. When Batman discovers what the League was doing, they have his memories edited as well despite the opposition from [[Green Arrow]]. Both Doctor Light and Batman would eventually recover from their respective mindwipe, leading Doctor Light to swear vengeance to all heroes and Batman's distrust towards his allies.\n\n===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A Flash's death (Crisis on Infinite Earths).png|thumb|right|250px|Barry heroically sacrificing himself to stop the Anti-Monitor; however, it is later retconned that he actually still alive but trapped in the Speed Force following the battle. Art by [[George Perez]] from ''Crisis on Infinite Earth'' #8 (November 1985).]] -->\nFollowing the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. After only a few weeks of happiness, the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' intervenes, and Allen is captured by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and brought to 1985; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of traveling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor could not allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth with an anti-matter cannon, creating a speed vortex to draw the power in, but dies in the process as the power becomes too much for his body.<ref name=\"dc-ency\"/> It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the [[Speed Force]], the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, Kid Flash [[Wally West]], his nephew and sidekick, takes up the mantle of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marv Wolfman|Wolfman, Marv]]|Title = [[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 12|Date = March 1986|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====After death====\n[[Marv Wolfman]], scribe for the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original ''Crisis'' collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be reintroduced, without a [[Retroactive continuity|retcon]], into DC Universe continuity.<ref>[http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q&A.html ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060128175053/http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q%26A.html |date=January 28, 2006 }}</ref> This loophole would allow a writer to pull Barry out of his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon. However, Barry would know he must someday finish his death run, and would become more determined to use his speed to help others.\n\nIt should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have \"died\" in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor's anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon. After this act, according to ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/wheres-barry.html |title=Where's Barry?

His spirit seems to still be alive within the Speed Force, along with [[Max Mercury]] and other speedsters.\n\nIn [[Quasar (comics)|''Quasar'']] by [[Marvel Comics]], released between December 1990 and May 1994, an amnesiac Barry Allen, misremembering his name as \"Buried Alien\" and the [[Speed Force]] as the \"Hyperforce\", and surprised to have \"form\" again, enters the [[Marvel Universe]] in the middle of the great race to be the \"Fastest Man Alive\" after the players had passed the first warp junction, where he is discovered by the Runner co-ordinating it and invited to participate in his great race. Beating several other speedsters ([[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro \"Quicksilver\" Maximoff]], [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)| Wendell \"Quasar\" Vaughn]], [[Whizzer (Robert Frank)|Robert \"The Whizzer\" Frank]], [[Mar-Vell|Captain Marvel]], [[Speed Demon (comics)|James \"Speed Demon\" Sanders]], [[Black Racer (Marvel Comics)|Ariana \"Black Racer\"]], [[Super Sabre (comics)|Martin \"Super Sabre\" Fletcher]] and [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]]) he is declared to be the \"fastest man alive\", a title he believes feels \"right\", though he never recovers his memory during his time in the universe. He later adopted the alias \"FastForward\", before he is returned to his original universe with Makkari's assistance.\n\n===Legacy===\nIris is pregnant, and she has two children who have super-speed powers, the [[Tornado Twins]], who later meet the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. In the multiversal variant known as Earth-247, each of her children themselves have children with speed-based abilities. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire [[XS (comics)|XS]], while the other, [[Bart Allen]], is born with an accelerated metabolism that rapidly ages him, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse under the tutelage of [[Max Mercury]], and later becomes the second Kid Flash as a member of the [[Teen Titans]]. [[One Year Later|One year]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by his clone [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Marc Guggenheim|Guggenheim, Marc]]|Title = The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive|Volume = 1|Issue = 13|Date = August 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Wally then retook the identity of the Flash.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Mark Waid|Waid, Mark]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)#Volume 2 (1987-2006, 2007-2008)|All_Flash]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = September 2007|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> Bart would later be resurrected as Kid Flash by the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] in the 31st century to combat [[Superboy-Prime]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nBarry Allen appears in issue 3 as the Flash in the JLA when the two realities start changing, along with Hal Jordan. When the two teams see their real futures, Barry witnesses his death during Crisis on Infinite Earths as the [[Grandmaster (comics)|Grandmaster]] shows the heroes how reality should be, but nevertheless resolves to help restore the timeline as it is not his place to play God. He talks with Hal Jordan over the similarity of their situation, stating that dying could not be so bad so long as they have left a legacy for others (Wally West and [[Green Lantern (Kyle Rayner)|Kyle Rayner]], in their cases) to fight for what they believe. He helps the team get into [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s base by using his running on a treadmill to pass the ship through the dimensional barrier. With the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]], he is ordered by [[Captain America]] to find ways through Krona's defences, and alerts the group to a probably lethal force field. During the final battle, Barry saves [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]] from being killed when the [[Absorbing Man]] breaks the ground beneath him, but both of them are blasted and apparently killed by [[Dreamslayer]]. At the end, it is revealed that Barry got the two of them out alive and at Captain America's suggestion they laid low and because of this, Hawkeye is able to destroy Krona's machine with a TNT arrow while Barry distracts him, then Barry takes the 12 items of power. As a result, reality is restored, Barry disappears and Wally returns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis'' appearances===\nWally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], regrets the public knowledge of his identity. Barry appears from somewhere in time\u2014stating that he is from a period shortly before his death\u2014counseling his nephew, and talking the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] into granting his wish, erasing all public knowledge of Wally and Barry's identities as the Flash (Although Wally himself also loses his memory of his identity for a time). Barry then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, on the three most difficult days of his life of which this is the first. In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of the original Professor Zoom to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his \"own\" Reverse-Flash; Zoom apparently retrieved [[Eobard Thawne]] from the day that he attempted to kill Fiona Webb, with Barry following his nemesis. For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper time, dragging his Zoom with him and breaking his enemy's neck in his timeline.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nIn the fourth issue of ''Infinite Crisis'', Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]], to help his grandson Bart deal with [[Superboy-Prime]], taking the villainous teen with him in the Speed Force. Bart Allen appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy-Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy-Prime once more.\n\nIn ''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (2006) (with a portion taking place shortly before ''Infinite Crisis'' #5) it is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate [[Keystone City]] along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick, and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West did not go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.\n\n===Return===\n[[Image:Barry Return.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen returns to the DC Universe, fleeing from the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]. Art from ''[[Final Crisis]]'' #2 by [[J. G. Jones]].]]\nTwenty three years after his death in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Barry Allen's essence made a return to the present DC Universe proper in ''DC Universe'' #0, preceding his full-time return in the pages of writer [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]''.\n\n''DC Universe'' #0 features an unnamed narrator who initially associates himself with \"everything\". As the story progresses, he begins to recall his past and association with [[Justice League]] members, particularly [[Hal Jordan]] and [[Superman]]. The lettering in which he speaks to the reader is yellow on backgrounds that are initially black. As the story moves forward, the background slowly begins turning red. In the final pages, the narration boxes feature a yellow lightning bolt. Over time, as he recalls friendships and connections with other people, his mind begins to narrow, remarking \"I...know him. I am no longer everything. I am a shaft of light split through a prism\". Yet he is still the only one able to see \"the shadow falling over everything\", in the form of [[Darkseid]]. On the final page, the moon appears in front of a red sky, as a yellow lightning bolt strikes diagonally in front of it creating the logo of the Flash, as he remarks \"and now I remember\". The title of the story is revealed to be \"Let There Be Lightning\".<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]] and [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = DC Universe Zero|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nA ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' story released on the same day proclaimed that Barry Allen has returned to life, with issue co-writer [[Geoff Johns]] stating, \"When the greatest evil comes back to the DC Universe, the greatest hero needed to return.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |title=Entertainment/Arts 2008-04-30 |publisher=NY Daily News |date=2008-04-29 |accessdate=2011-04-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204145213/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/arts/2008/04/30/2008-04-30_the_flash_outruns_the_reaper_23_years_af-1.html |archivedate=2009-02-04 }}</ref>\n\n====''Final Crisis''====\n{{Main|Final Crisis}}\nBarry makes his [[wikt:corporeal|corporeal]] return in ''Final Crisis'' #2.

Meanwhile, Wally and Barry run a few weeks into the future. When they come to rest, Wally asks Barry if it is really him. Lamenting on Orion's death, which he was unable to stop, Barry wonders why he is now alive after being dead for so long. It is then that Barry and Wally are confronted by [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batwoman]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Giganta]], who have all been transformed into the new [[Female Furies]] following the release of the [[Anti-Life Equation]].<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 3|Date = July 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nDespite the fact that this new version of the Female Furies is equipped with the ability to track down speedsters, perceived by [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] and Darkseid as the only obstacle left between them and world domination, Barry's expertise allows him to overcome their foes and run through the ruined Earth.\n\nBarry stops to see his wife Iris and save her from the slavery of the [[Anti-Life Equation]]. Seeing his wife again for the first time in years, Barry is overcome with emotion and gives his brainwashed wife a deep kiss. While kissing her, the Speed Force sparkles out of his body, enveloping Iris and freeing her from the Equation. The Allens and Wally West are left to fend in a conquered world.<ref name=\"FinalCrisis4\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = August 2008|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> In the seventh and final issue of ''Final Crisis'', Barry and Wally lead the Black Racer to [[Darkseid]], dealing the cosmic tyrant a blow that, coupled with [[Batman]] shooting him in the shoulder with the god-bullet, would facilitate his ultimate defeat.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Grant Morrison|Morrison, Grant]]|Title = [[Final Crisis]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 7|Date = January 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====''The Flash: Rebirth''====\n{{Main|The Flash: Rebirth}}\nIn 2009, writer [[Geoff Johns]] and artist [[Ethan Van Sciver]] created ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', a 6-issue miniseries bringing Barry Allen back to a leading role in the DC Universe as the Flash, much in the same vein as ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]''. When asked what Flashes would appear in the series, Johns and Van Sciver said, \"All of them.\"\n\nThe series begins with the cities of Central and Keystone celebrating the return of, \"Central City's Flash\", [[Wonder Woman]] having used her government contacts to create the story that Barry was in witness protection to account for his resurrection. Avoiding the parades, parties, and other celebrations of his return, Barry instead contemplates why he is alive again. A visit to the [[Flash Museum]] and from his friend [[Hal Jordan]] is not enough to put his mind at ease as he runs off as the Flash. \"I can't be late,\" he says. When asked by Hal late for what, Flash replies, \"For whatever the rest of the world needs me for.\"\n\nIt is then revealed that Flash's mother was murdered when he was a child, and his father was arrested for the crime (this is pointedly contrary to previous Flash stories, in which both his parents appear alive). Flash describes this as \"the only one open case I left behind.\" Before he can contemplate this any further, the speedster villain [[Savitar (comics)|Savitar]] escapes the Speed Force through Flash. When Flash manages to put his hand on Savitar's shoulder, the villain screams in agony and crumbles into dust, not before telling Flash, \"...You were the beginning, Allen...and you're the end.\" At that moment, [[Wally West]], West's children Iris and Jai, [[Jesse Chambers|Liberty Belle]], [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and [[Bart Allen|Kid Flash]] all experience painful convulsions and are engulfed in lightning.<ref name=\"TFR1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 1|Date = April 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nBarry's conflict with the speed cult{{clarify|date=September 2011}} culminates in the death of their new leader who was attempting to avenge Savitar's death.

This led to the hero's reappearance during the ''[[Final Crisis]]''. Afterward, Zoom transformed himself into \"a new kind of speedster and created his negative Speed Force to contaminate Barry and the other heroic speedsters. Before Barry can fight any further, Zoom fades away. Wally enters the Speed Force to retrieve his uncle, and after venturing deeper into the Speed Force, Max reveals to Barry that it was Allen himself who created the Speed Force. Meanwhile, Wally manages to reach Barry and Max, and the three begin their escape. As the heroic speedsters are recharged with energy, Barry, Wally, Jay, Max, and Bart charge towards Zoom.<ref name=\"TFR4\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 4|Date = August 2009|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nThe seven speedsters (the 5 men plus Jesse Chambers and Iris West-Park) battle against Zoom, and despite being outnumbered, Zoom pulls Barry away.

They reach Thawne, becoming the lightning bolt that turns Barry into the Flash as they are able to stop Zoom from killing Iris. As the two Flashes push Zoom back through time to the present, they see that the Justice League, the Justice Society, and the Outsiders have built a device specifically for Thawne. Barry tosses him in and activates the device, severing his connection to the negative Speed Force. The Flashes tie Zoom up to stop him from running. With the threat ended, everyone celebrates by welcoming Barry back and the speedsters in general. Later, Barry closes the case on his mother's death and opts to take all the other cold cases they had after his death. Barry spends some time with Iris before racing to Washington to celebrate his return with the Justice League, apologizing for being late.<ref name=\"TFR6\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash: Rebirth]]|Volume = 1|Issue = 6|Date = February 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\n====''Blackest Night''====\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\n[[Image:Blue Lantern Flash.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barry Allen as a member of the [[Blue Lantern Corps]] during the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' event.

Allen appears alongside Jordan in the [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue ''Blackest Night'' #0 that acts as a prologue to the July company crossover.\n\nAt the grave of [[Bruce Wayne]] in [[Gotham City]], Hal and Barry reflect on Batman's death and how the hero community is avoiding linking Wayne and Batman.\n\nThis reflection turns to the pair looking at their own deaths, comparing the sadness that Barry's death engendered in others while Hal's death produced anger. Hal sums it up by telling Barry, \"'''I''' died a '''sinner'''. '''''You''''' died a '''saint'''.\" (though he admits he's not and reflecting of his past sins.) The conversation moves on to the world becoming \"more dangerous\" after Barry's death and observing that the deaths of [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] and [[Martian Manhunter]] cost the [[Justice League]] its \"heart and soul\". As they leave the cemetery, Barry expresses hope that their dead comrades will be returned to them.

Barry decides to go to [[Gorilla City]] to seek aid from its ruler [[Solovar]], unaware the gorilla leader had been killed years before. Finding the city attacked, Barry assumed [[Gorilla Grodd|Grodd]] had struck only to be horrified to learn Solovar was now a Black Lantern.

Nekron reveals that all the resurrected heroes are tied to him, because he allowed them to rise again. As such they belong to him.

Barry is shown to be skilled with his ring in creating energy constructs based on his imagination and an ability of flight (possibly because of the understanding with Hal's ring), as he is able to create images of Bart as Impulse and Kid Flash against him in order to make him feel again. Barry's plan almost works as Bart reacts to the images of his past and the constructs begin to attempt to take the black ring from him, but later is interrupted by the Black Lantern Professor Zoom and Solovar.

After the events of ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]'', Barry Allen is reintegrating himself into life in [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. Under the cover of having been in [[witness protection]], Allen returns to the Central City Police Department's crime lab and returns to the streets as the Flash. While readjusting to life as the Flash, a man appears out of thin air in the costume of Flash rogue the [[Mirror Master]], and promptly dies on the street.\n\nWhen Barry arrives on the scene to investigate, he sees the man is neither original Mirror Master Sam Scudder, or the current Rogue, Evan McCulloch. Hearing of another portal appearing, Barry transforms into the Flash and runs to investigate. When he arrives, a group of people in costumes similar to the Rogues, called ''[[Rogues (comics)#The Renegades|The Renegades]]'' appear and tell Barry that they are from the 25th century, and that he is under arrest for murdering the \"Mirror Monarch\". Barry tells the crew that he has not killed anyone, to which their leader, \"Commander Cold\", tells him, \"Not yet. But you will.\"<ref name=\"vol3no1\">{{Cite comic|Writer = [[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|Title = [[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]|Volume = 3|Issue = 1|Date = April 2010|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref>\n\nAfter a brief struggle, where Weather Warlock's time disc was damaged, the Renegades were forced back to the 25th century, which also caused the destruction of an apartment building due to their uncontrolled jump back. Barry saves everyone in the building, even rebuilding the building in minutes, and goes on to search for the true killer of Mirror Monarch. He is attacked again by the Renegades, but only before Captain Boomerang shows up, now wielding explosive energy boomerangs. Boomerang fights both the Flash and the Renegades, and a confused Top (one of the Renegades from the 25th century) questions his teammates on whether or not Barry Allen is the man they are looking for, pointing out that in their timeline, Boomerang never showed up.\n\nThe Renegades finally corner Captain Boomerang when the Rogues arrive with a giant mirror left by the previous Mirror Master that says \"In Case The Flash Returns Break Glass\". An all out brawl ensues as the Rogues battle the Renegades. Meanwhile, Flash is confronted by Top who warns him that the reason he will eventually kill Mirror Monarch is because of Iris's death, which he claims will be caused when the giant mirror breaks, releasing the Mirror Lords. Top tells Barry that one of the Mirror Lords will possess Iris and take her away from him. Barry races to stop the mirror from breaking, with Top at his side. However, when the White Lantern entity reaches out to Captain Boomerang, telling him to \"Throw the Boomerang\", Boomerang responds by throwing dozens of boomerangs in every direction. One of them hits the glass and it begins to break. Top tells Flash to stop the Mirror Lords, while he goes and protects Iris. Flash questions does not make sense, but Top throws him into the mirror and flees.\n\nIn the mirror, Flash is exposed to strange visions of his mother. Outside, the Rogue Mirror Master tells the others that the mirror is actually a slow acting poison and they flee. Barry escapes the mirror confused and asks, \"Where are the Mirror Lords?\" He is then arrested by the Renegades, who realize that this was all a setup by Top to frame the Flash for his own personal gains. Barry is transported to a 25th-century court, while Top confronts Iris.\n\nThe story concludes with Barry escaping the 25th century court and going after Top. Top reveals that the reason for all of his crimes is because Barry reopened a previously closed case. Barry felt that the person convicted was actually innocent. The person who is actually guilty of the crime is one of Top's ancestors. Top reveals that they do not allow anyone in the Renegades who has any ancestors with a criminal record. The Flash is able to beat Top, and convict the right man for murder, letting go the innocent man who was sent to prison. Afterward, the 25th century court and the Renegades go over the facts, realizing that the Flash was right and that their entire record of history is wrong. This alludes to the upcoming Flash event, ''[[Flash: Flashpoint|Flashpoint]]''. Meanwhile, a man on a Speed Force-powered motorcycle (later revealed to be a Speed Force police officer under the name of Hot Pursuit)<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #8 (November 2010)</ref> moves through the desert and says that if Barry does not find the flashpoint, it will destroy the world. As he continues through the desert, Speed Force lightning strikes in the distance.\n\nIn a ''Green Lantern'' storyline, Barry becomes the latest host for the embodiment of fear, [[Parallax (comics)|Parallax]], after he joins Hal Jordan's quest of locating all of the entities who each represent aspects of the power of the emotional spectrum. Barry was susceptible to the entity's attacks due to his fear for Jordan's safety.<ref>''Green Lantern'' vol. 4 #59 (Nov. 2010)</ref> Barry is eventually freed after the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, helps him remember his capability for benevolence over his fear.\n\nDC has also announced via the Flashpoint Friday Blog that ''Flash'' #12 will be the last in the series despite a thirteenth issue originally having been announced for sale on May 25, 2011, but which has since been withdrawn.\n\n====''Flashpoint''====\n{{Main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAs the story begins, Barry Allen wakes up in his office and discovers that his mother is alive, there is no trace of [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]] leading their respective nations in a war, his wife [[Iris West]] is unmarried, and himself currently powerless. Barry seeks the aid of [[Batman]], driving to Gotham City and entering a run-down Wayne Manor. He explores what turns out to be a small Batcave until he is attacked by Batman. Barry tries to explain who he is by saying he knows Batman is Bruce Wayne, only to find that in this reality, Batman is [[Thomas Wayne]].<ref>''Flashpoint'' #1 (May 2011)</ref> While Barry is being beat up by Batman, he explains about his secret identity as the Flash and his relation to Bruce Wayne. Barry's memories spontaneously change and he realizes that the world of Flashpoint is not an alternate dimension, but his own. Barry uses his ring, which he uses to contain his Flash outfit, but the ring instead ejects [[Professor Zoom]]'s costume. Barry tells Batman that Zoom is taunting him with it. Barry explains that both he and Zoom have the ability to alter time, leading Batman to ask him about how Bruce was to have lived in his place and if he can really change the world. Barry states that he needs his speed first. Later, Barry and Batman create an electric chair-like device to try and recreate the accident that gave him his speed; however, the first attempt meets with failure, leaving Barry severely burned.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #2 (June 2011)</ref>\n\nBarry awakes on an operating table in the Batcave and is covered in bandages and third degree burns. Despite Thomas' advice, Barry sits back down in the electric chair device. When lightning strikes a second time, Barry's super-speed returns, and he then saves the Batman from being impaled on a fence. Barry's injuries are healing rapidly due to his speed-enhanced regeneration. He also makes a new copy of his Flash costume. The Flash researches the incarnations of heroes of the DC timeline, believing that Zoom deliberately changed their lives to prevent the Flash from creating a Justice League, and learns of a rocket that crashed into Metropolis which carried the infant Superman, who instead of being raised in Kansas was taken in by the government. They then contact [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] for his help in sneaking into the government bunker of \"Project: Superman\" that is 'raising' Superman after his rocket destroyed Metropolis upon its arrival, only to be disappointed at Superman's frail appearance. They head towards Project: Superman's underground base via the sewer. The group comes across a giant vault door bearing the Superman logo. After they open the door, the three see a pale, weakened Kal-El. Despite his appearance, Barry says that no matter what, Superman will always be a good person. When the arrival of guards forces them to escape, Superman's powers begin to manifest and he flies off leaving them at the hands of the guards.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #3 (July 2011)</ref>\n\nWhile they fend off the guards, they are rescued by Element Woman. Barry's memories begin to change much more drastically, altering his past. He states that he is running out of time and soon he will not be able to restore the timeline to normal. After Barry is recovering, he asks the heroes to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war from creating more casualties, although the heroes are not willing to unless Batman wants to join them. Cyborg explains to him that they believe Batman was invincible. However, Barry convinces him that no one is invincible; the [[Marvel Family]] and Batman agree to join him. The heroes arrive at New Themyscira to stop the Atlantean/Amazon war, and appear to be winning until [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]] reveals herself as the Amazon spy and uses her magic to separate the Marvel Family and restore them to their mortal forms. Penthesilea kills Billy Batson just as Professor Zoom reveals himself to Barry.<ref>''Flashpoint'' #4 (August 2011)</ref> Professor Zoom reveals to him that the \"Flashpoint\" timeline was actually created by Barry himself, after he traveled back in time to stop Zoom from killing his mother, but the timeline diverted into the near-apocalyptic world they find themselves in. He continues to taunt Barry with this knowledge, but is suddenly stabbed in the back by Batman wielding an Amazonian sword. Before Barry returns the timeline to normal, Batman thanks him for all he's done and gives him a letter addressed to his son. After this, Barry bids a farewell to his mother, knowing he must travel back in time to stop his younger self from altering time. Through the fusions of the time stream, Barry seemingly hears [[Pandora (DC Comics)|a voice]] explaining that the three timelines and worlds, need to become one again and would need his help to do this. After the ordeals, he visits the real Bruce Wayne and gives him the letter from his alternate father. Bruce is grateful to Barry of informing him of the events of the \"Flashpoint\" before the timeline was apparently returned to normal.<ref name=\"fp5\">''Flashpoint'' #5 (August 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nDC Comics relaunched ''The Flash'' with issue #1 in September 2011, with writing and art chores handled by [[Francis Manapul]] and Brian Buccellato as part of DC's company-wide title relaunch, [[The New 52]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |title=DC Comics Solicitations for September, 2011 |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=June 13, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928144827/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=32768 |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |title=Flash Reboot Creative Team: Francis Manapul and Brian Buccellato |publisher=SpeedForceOrg |date=June 2, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817004046/http://speedforce.org/2011/06/flash-reboot/ |archivedate=August 17, 2013 }}</ref> As with all of the books associated with the DC relaunch, Barry Allen appears to be about five years younger than the previous incarnation of the character. He gains his powers after getting frustrated and throwing a small machine at the window of his lab. The machine broke through the window, leaving a hole big enough for a bolt of lightning to charge through the hole and strike him.\n\nIn the second issue of the new ''[[Justice League]]'' title (the first released comic series of the New 52 initiative and \"opening shot\" of the new DC Universe), Flash is called to assist [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] and [[Batman]] in wrangling an out-of-control [[Superman]], and later assists with the pursuit of an alien, revealed to be an agent of [[Darkseid]].<ref>{{cite comic| writer= Johns, Geoff| penciller= [[Jim Lee|Lee, Jim]]| inker= Williams, Scott| story= Justice League Part Two| title= Justice League| volume= 2| issue= 2| date= December 2011}}</ref> In this new continuity, Barry's marriage to Iris West never took place, and he is instead in a relationship with longtime co-worker [[Patty Spivot]]. In this new series, the Flash draws deeper into the Speed Force, enhancing his mental abilities while still trying to get a full grasp on his powers, which he does not yet exert total control over.\n\nAs revealed in issue #0 of the current series, Barry Allen's father was placed in prison for the murder of his mother. The murder occurred shortly after Barry returned victorious from a school spelling bee, and Barry placed the trophy he won on his mother's grave in her memory. While the evidence seems to indicate his father's guilt, Barry makes proving his father's innocence a priority.\n\nBarry is also part of the main cast of the relaunched ''Justice League'' series, making his debut in the series' second issue. Following Convergence, Barry has a new suit in issue #41, which has a darker shade and features more streaks.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{expand section|date=March 2017}}\nDuring [[DC Rebirth]], Barry is no longer the only Flash. It is revealed that [[Wally West]] has been lost in the Speed Force for ten years, realizing during this time that Barry is not responsible of changing the timeline after the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' crisis, the [[Doctor Manhattan|unknown entity]] used Barry's time travelling as an opportunity to fundamentally alter reality. The fallout of the recent Darkseid War allowed Wally to try and reach out to his former friends in the hopes of either returning or warning them of the truth, but each attempt caused him to fall further into the Speed Force. After realizing not even Linda (his traditional \"lightning rod\") could remember him, Wally sank into desolation and chose to appear before Barry one last time to thank him for the life he had given him. Just before Wally disappeared, Barry remembered him and dragged him free of the Speed Force. Following a tearful reunion, Wally gave Barry his warning of the true source of the universal change and the dangers to come. Because of Wally, Barry is now aware that the timeline is not reset correctly after Flashpoint and thus another alternate timeline. However, he still cannot remember his pre-Flashpoint life, such as people like Jay Garrick, his long-last marriage with Iris and the details of his feuds with the Reverse-Flash / Eobard Thawne (who now remembers their pre-Flashpoint history), and remembers Wally from their new DC Rebirth timeline history. Despite being informed by Wally that another party is responsible, Barry remains in guilt over his mistakes, and seeks to find and stop them in hopes of making amends.<ref>''DC Universe: Rebirth'' one-shot (May 2016)</ref> Although the two decide to keep Wally's return secret from Iris based on Wally's own experience with Linda, Barry encourages him to return to the Titans, but also recommends that he don a new costume to reflect that he is the Flash rather than 'Kid Flash'. While Wally considers his options, Barry visits Batman to discuss the new evidence of some outside force attacking them, musing on how personal this assault appears, but despite the potential danger, Batman and Barry agree to keep their investigation to themselves until they know what they are up against.<ref>''The Flash: Rebirth'' one-shot (June 2016)</ref> Later, when Eobard Thawne attacks Iris and [[Wallace West (DC comics)|Wallace]], Iris had glimpses of her pre-Flashpoint life with Barry and learns his secrets as the Flash in the process. Barry then learned of their marriage in the other timeline as well.  Knowing from Thawne that her entire life has been drastically altered and that Barry is indirectly responsible for it as the result of his time-traveling actions, Iris now distrusts Barry.<ref>''The Flash'' vol. 5 #24 (August 2017)</ref> To make matters worse for Barry, while he's entering the Negative Speed Force, he becomes the Negative-Flash which is more lethal than the original, and mostly dangerous to control.\n\nAfter gotten rid of the Negative Speed Force, he investigates with the death of Turbine, but thanks to Godspeed's help, he discovers that Captain Cold was the one who killed him because he seeks redemption. He visits Wally after defeating the Top, he discusses about him telling Iris that he's alive and existed. While he's rekindling his relationship with Iris, the city is being attacked by Gorilla Grodd and his organization the Black Hole.\n\nAfter defeating Grodd and getting Wally to meet Iris for the first time, they've been encountered by the Renegades. The Renegades take the Flashes and Iris back to the 25th century to get answers about why Iris killed Eobard Thawne, only to discover that Hunter Zolomon has been manipulating everyone as a plot to bring conflict between Barry and Wally for the fate of the Speed Force. After Wally defeated Hunter, Barry place him under watch at the Sanctuary while he's moving with his girlfriend Iris at her place after Wallace angrily left them. Barry begins searching for the other forces such as Sage Force and Strength Force after the Force Barrier's broken; he ends up discovering about the four forces conflicting for the control of the Forever Force.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nBarry Allen has the ability to run at super-human velocities. He was at times during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] described as faster than the [[Action potential|speed of thought]].  ''Flash'' #150, \"straining every muscle\", he ran at ten times the speed of light.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fox, Gardner|Title = Flash|Volume = 1|Issue = 150|Date = February 1965|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> However, when he pushed himself further (during the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'') he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, traveled back in time, and was revealed in ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers.<ref>{{Cite comic|Writer = Fleming, Robert Loren|Title = Secret Origins Annual|Volume = 1|Issue = 2|Date = December 1988|Publisher = DC Comics}}</ref> This was later [[retcon]]ned in ''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1, where Barry stated that he \"ran into the [[Speed Force]]\", and that, \"When he stopped the [[Anti-Monitor]], when [he] ran into the \"Speed Force\" and joined it, it was like shedding [his] identity.\"<ref name=\"TFR1\" /> Allen possesses abilities that original Flash [[Jay Garrick]] has not always been able to duplicate, and most notably the ability to \"vibrate\" in such a way as to pass through solid matter. Allen regularly engaged in [[time travel]] by using his Cosmic Treadmill device. His speed also allows him, in certain circumstances, to \"vibrate\" between [[Parallel universe (fiction)|dimensions]]. In [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[Final Crisis]]'', using the Speed Force, Allen was able to undo the effects of the [[Anti-Life Equation]] upon an individual: an ability he used on his wife Iris to free her from the bondage of [[Darkseid]]'s mind control.<ref name=\"FinalCrisis4\" />\n\nBarry's speed has numerous secondary applications. He can use it to generate cyclones by spinning his arms quickly. Barry can also manipulate the electrical Speed Force energy he generates. He can channel the energy into arcs of lightning, as well as use the electricity to manipulate magnetism on a minor level. He has also used the lightning to create blinding amounts of light. By interlocking his lightning with that of another speedster, Barry can short circuit their connection to the Speed Force. Barry is also immune to telepathic attacks and control as he can shift his thoughts at a speed faster than normal thought. Through \"speed-reading\", he can absorb large amounts of information into his [[short-term memory]], which remain in his mind just long enough for him to make use of it. Using this technique, Barry was able to learn enough about building work to rebuild a destroyed apartment building.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 3) #2 (May 2010)</ref> The Speed Force also supplies Barry with a protective aura that shields him from friction and kinetic impacts, as well as grants him superhuman durability. Other aspects of Barry's powers include an enhanced metabolism, which grants him a regenerative healing factor. In the New 52, Barry learned that his body is using the Speed Force to its full extent but his brain was not. With the help of Dr. Elias he was able to learn how to use the Speed Force to process more information, and make even quicker decisions, to the point where he feels like he can see everything before it happens.<ref>''The Flash'' (Vol. 4) #2 (December 2011)</ref> Barry also developed the ability to speed up the flow of time around him, which he used to negate the powers of Zoom, who was able to slow down time. In terms of DC's internal lexicon, Barry is classified as a [[metahuman]]: a human being who possesses extranormal abilities either through birth or (as in Barry's case) as the result of some external event.<ref>''Superman'' #7 (2012)</ref><ref>''Voodoo'' #7 (2012)</ref>\n\n==Rogues gallery==\n{{Main|Rogues (comics)}}\nThe Flash has acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains. Their number includes (but is not limited to) several who formed a loose association and refer to themselves as the [[Rogues (comics)|Rogues]], disdaining the use of the term \"[[supervillain]]\" or \"super-criminal\". These criminals typically have unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each have adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods.\n\n==Other versions==\n* Barry Allen is a supporting character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]''. He has been kept by [[Lex Luthor]] as a power source for most of the East Coast, constantly running on a treadmill to provide cheap electrical power or else Iris will be executed. After being rescued, Barry wears a black version of his original Flash costume which Batman's young assistants deemed as \"old\"\u2014\"Kids, these days, can't tell the difference between just plain old and classic\", he mutters. He then aids [[Batman]] and other heroes in restoring order, though they clash when Barry wants to save people in danger while Batman is prepared to let them die for the sake of his long-term strategy.\n* Barry Allen appears in ''[[JLA: Age of Wonder]]'' as a scientist working with [[Superman]] and a consortium of early twentieth-century scientists such as [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Nikola Tesla]]. His uniform incorporates the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] look with the [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]-style helmet worn by Jay Garrick.\n* In ''League of Justice'', a ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''-type story, Barry is recast as \"Phaeton\", who wears a mystical brooch resembling Flash's lightning-bolt chest emblem, and has bathed in dragon's blood in order to protect himself from speed friction.\n* In ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'', Barry is one of a number of [[metahuman]]s imprisoned by a [[theocracy|theocratic]] state, discovered and released by Batman during a raid on the government. He then shows Batman some of the attempts to recreate his powers in others, ranging from a man who cannot control his ability to vibrate to a woman whose brain operates at lightspeed while her body is still at normal speed or a man rapidly aging to death. While Barry and Batman are able to defeat the brainwashed [[Zatanna]], Barry is then killed when his captor reveals that his research has included discovering how to deactivate the aura that protects Barry from being destroyed by the friction he generates while running.\n* A version of Barry Allen aka '''Hot Pursuit''' appeared in the lead into [[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]].<ref name=\"tf12\">''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #6 (January 2011)</ref> Little is known about the exact origins of Hot Pursuit, or how he came to be. The only thing known is the fact that he is a version of Barry Allen from the future, who goes back in time to warn himself about the upcoming events of Flashpoint. Hot Pursuit's history is assumed to be the same as Barry Allen's up until the single point in time, where a great anomaly altered the reality of the future all together. The unknown event that made Barry Allen don the role of Hot Pursuit is the same event he travels back in time to warn himself about, as well as the event that causes Flashpoint. With Flashpoint's widespread time-altering effects, it is possible that Barry Allen lost his connection to the Speed Force, thus needing the cosmic motorcycle Hot Pursuit is seen riding to access the Speed Force and travel back in time. This motorcycle also needs to be charged constantly with mass amounts of electricity in order for it to continue to be able to access the Speed Force, thus it is unable to naturally access the Speed Force like Barry Allen or the rest of the Flash Family.<ref name=autogenerated2>''The Flash'' (vol. 3) #12 (May 2011)</ref>\n[[Image:Quasar1.png|thumb|upright|\"'''Buried Alien'''\"]]\n* A story in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comic book series ''[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]'', written four years after ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has the [[Marvel Universe]] speedsters facing off in a competition set up by a being called the [[Runner (comics)|Runner]]. The contest is a race from the Earth to the Moon. During the race, a surge of energy hits the track, leaving a being with blonde hair and dressed in the remains of a red outfit with yellow boots. This being has no memory, but an enormous desire to run. He goes on to win the race, passing Marvel speedsters such as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] in the process. When asked what his name is, the man replies, \"I'm not sure. \"Buried Alien\"... Something like that.\" When asked how it felt to be the fastest man alive, he replied, \"It feels... right.\"<ref>Quasar #17, December 199</ref> The racer goes on to take the name Fast-Forward, disappearing into the universe in an attempt to help [[Makkari (comics)|Makkari]], who is stuck at hyper speed.<ref>Quasar #58, May 1994</ref>\n* In the Elseworlds tale ''[[Superman & Batman: Generations]]'', Barry's life is still the same, but heroes age in real time. This reality shows no sign of the Crisis ever happening, so an elderly Barry is seen to be alive and well in 2008.\n* The Elseworlds story ''Flashpoint'' shows an alternate reality where Barry Allen becomes the Flash in 1956, the year he first appeared in comics. He is more involved in government affairs. By 1963, he has ended the [[Cold War]] and pushed the [[communism|communists]] out of [[Vietnam]]. However, his career is cut short as he takes a bullet aimed at [[John F. Kennedy]]. He is paralyzed from the neck down, but he still has the fastest mind on Earth and forms Allen Industries. By 1988, he and [[Vandal Savage|Vandal Savage's]] Immortality, Inc. have begun an exploration of [[Mars]]. In 1998, Wally West leads an expedition to Mars, during which he finds the flashpoint, an object which killed all life on Mars. Savage reveals he is the one who shot Allen. Barry makes contact with [[Wally West|Wally]], who is going on a super speed rampage. Barry is cured and defeats Savage. He then enters the flashpoint, going into the [[Speed Force]].\n* In ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]] Annual'' #7, an alternate universe is shown where shortly after Wally West became Kid Flash, he became a superstar celebrity. However, Barry was tragically killed while battling [[Captain Cold]]. Ten years later, Wally is now a [[paraplegia|paraplegic]] and Captain Cold has written a supposedly \"true\" story about Barry that paints him as arrogant and incompetent. Wally decides to make a movie about his mentor that portrays the genuine Barry Allen. The resulting film is a success.\n* The Barry Allen of [[Earth-51]], where [[secret identity|secret identities]] are no longer needed by superheroes, is seen alive. He is subsequently killed by the [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] of New Earth.\n* In ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'' a version of Barry Allen is a member of a Justice League where Superman did not become a hero and join the team until much later. In lieu of Superboy's adventures with the Legion of Super-Heroes, the Flash visited the 30th Century instead. Barry Allen of ''The Nail'' is almost identical to the pre-Crisis Earth-1 version, except that his costume resembles Wally's. His most prominent scene in the story is a confrontation with [[Amazo]] where he manages to defeat the android by turning intangible and removing his computerized brain before Amazo can process and mimic that attack.\n* In the prequel comic to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' Barry joins Superman's Regime in a more forceful approach to saving the world from crime. However, Barry remains one of the few (alongside Shazam) to maintain some sense of morality, as he is more prone to questioning some of Superman's more drastic actions in the Year One series. Though Batman tries to convince Barry of the Regime's negative influence, he chooses to stay with them, though still tries to convince Superman his more drastic actions will not go down well. In the game, Barry finally defects from the Regime after Superman murders Shazam for questioning his ethics. He joins the Insurgency and plays a critical role in stopping Superman's dictatorship. While he and the other Regime members are arrested, he is pardoned thanks to Batman vouching for him and given a job at Luthor/Wayne climate research. His superior, Doctor Randall, convinces Barry to become the Flash again to aid the heroes in stopping [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s invasion.\n* A version of Barry Allen is present through ''[[Dark Nights: Metal]]''. This version hails from Earth-Minus-52 of the Dark Multiverse, where Batman became mad due to the deaths of his crimefighting sidekicks. Batman manages to absorb Barry's body, taking the Speed Force for himself and calling himself \"'''Red Death'''\"; however Barry's mind remains present in Bruce's body, pleading Bruce to stop his dark crusade. When Red Death is hit by the positive energy, Bruce dies, leaving Barry alive and in control of his body, with the costume changing its color from red to gold. Barry tries his best to help his counterpart from Earth-0. However, because Barry from Earth-Minus-52 is a \"creature of darkness\", the exposure to the positive energy starts to rip him apart, killing him almost instantly.\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Flash in other media}}\n\n===Film===\n====DC Extended Universe====\n{{main|DC Extended Universe}}\n[[File:EzraFlash.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ezra Miller]] as Barry Allen/The Flash in 2017 film, ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''.]]\n[[Ezra Miller]] portrays Barry Allen/The Flash in the DCEU.

He is voiced by [[Scott Whyte]] and is an amalgamation of Baron Blitzkrieg, Baroness Blitzkrieg, Blitzen and Nazi Flash.\n* The Arrowverse Flash and the DCEU Flash appeared in the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' crossover played by Grant Gustin and Ezra Miller respectively.\n\n====Abandoned developments====\n* In February 2007 it was announced that Warner Bros hired husband and wife duo Michele and [[Kieran Mulroney]] to write a script for a Justice League film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Pamela McClintock; Ben Fritz | title = 'Justice' prevails for Warner Bros. | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117960018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2007-02-22 | accessdate = 2007-04-12}}</ref> [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] signed to direct in September 2007.<ref>{{cite news|author=Diane Garrett |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972369 |title=George Miller to lead ''Justice League'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329050152/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972369 |archivedate=2012-03-29 }}</ref> Titled ''Justice League Mortal'', [[Adam Brody]] was cast as Barry Allen and the film nearly went into production,<ref>{{cite news|author=Damen Norton |url=http://www.heyuguys.com/adam-brody-interview-justice-league-and-some-girls/ |title=Adam Brody on Some Girl(s), Neil LaBute and the Justice League Movie |publisher=Heyuguys.com |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2014-09-07 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908063629/http://www.heyuguys.com/adam-brody-interview-justice-league-and-some-girls/ |archivedate=2014-09-08 }}</ref> but the film was pushed back with Writers Guild Strike and the [[Australian Film Commission]] refusing to house filming over tax rebate disagreements.<ref>{{cite news | author = Garry Maddox | title = Mega movie refused rebate | work = [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] | date = 2008-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Video games===\n* Barry Allen is the Flash in the crossover video game ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', voiced by [[Taliesin Jaffe]]. He appears in a variant of his current costume. Although the character model contains green eyes, normally a sign of Wally West, as well as the dual lightning bolt belt (instead of Allen's single bolt belt), which is associated with West's, the game's \"Bios\" section confirms that it is indeed Allen.<ref>''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'' Flash Biographical Information</ref> In Flash's ending, Flash discovered that he had retained a psychic bond with the warrior [[Liu Kang]] as a result of his aura attunement. The two agreed to warn each other of any cross universal breaches. It was not long before Liu Kang appeared and warned the Flash about the impending attack by the sorcerer [[Quan Chi]].\n* Barry Allen appears as the Flash in the [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOG]] ''[[DC Universe Online]]'', voiced by [[Dwight Schultz]]. In the exclusive \"Who do you trust\" trailer, he appears to be taking an order from Batman, and runs upon being told. While running, he stops to see [[Hal Jordan]] about to get killed by [[Black Adam]]. He runs there to save Hal. Before he can, though, Black Adam sets off an explosion that kills Barry, Hal, and other heroes.\n* Barry Allen was a playable character in the multiplayer battle arena game ''[[Infinite Crisis (video game)|Infinite Crisis]]'', voiced by Michael Rosenbaum.\n* Barry Allen was a playable hero in mobile [[multiplayer online battle arena|MOBA]] game that released by [[Tencent Games]], [[Arena of Valor]].\n* Barry Allen appears as a playable character in ''DC Unchained''.\n\n====LEGO series====\n* Barry Allen appears a member of the Justice League in LEGO films ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League vs. Bizarro League]]'', ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League \u2013 Attack of the Legion of Doom]]'', ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: Justice League \u2013 Cosmic Clash]]'', and ''[[Lego DC Comics Super Heroes: The Flash]]'', voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]].\n* Barry Allen appears a member of the Justice League in video games ''[[Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes|LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes]]'', ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham|LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'' and ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]] ; he also appears in the ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'' game, with the role reprised by ''[[Michael Rosenbaum]]''.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* Barry Allen is a playable character in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', voiced by [[Neal McDonough]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=5152 |title=The Voices of Injustice: Gods Among Us (2013, Video Game)&nbsp;\u2013 Voice Cast Listing at Voice Chasers |work=Voice Chasers |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311164941/http://voicechasers.com/database/showprod.php?prodid=5152 |archivedate=2016-03-11 }}</ref> He is seen at the beginning taking part in a battle against Lex Luthor and his villain allies. In the alternate reality, Flash is one of the heroes serving in [[Superman]]'s Regime, although he has doubts about Superman's true intentions. After Superman kills [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] when the latter questions his plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham City to show humanity that he is 'needed', the Flash realizes that the heroes have officially gone too far and defects to [[Batman]]'s Insurgency. After the original Superman deposes the Regime, Barry surrenders himself due to his previous alliance with the Regime, but is assured by [[Green Arrow]] that his help in their defeat will be mentioned at the Regime's trial. In Flash's ending, he defeats Superman but is still overcome with guilt for his actions with the Regime and goes into exile. To make amends, he retakes his superhero mantle and begins fighting crime relentlessly in Central City where he is referred to as \"The Ghost\".\n* He returns as a playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', now with [[Taliesin Jaffe]] reprising his role from ''MK vs DC''. In the story, Flash has been pardoned from prison in recognition of his aid in deposing Superman's regime, and now seeks to make amends for his time as a regime member. In his playable chapter, Flash single-handedly defends Metropolis from Brainiac's initial attack and briefly comes to blows with Hal Jordan, who is trying to atone for his misdeeds as a Regime partisan, much like Flash himself. The two put their differences aside and join Batman's Insurgency. After Brainiac is defeated, he sides with Batman on allowing Brainiac to live so the captured and lost cities could be restored. Flash attempts to stop an enraged Superman but is easily defeated. In his arcade mode ending, Flash throws Brainiac into the end of time and enters the Speed Force, where he is reunited with other speedsters. Together, they set out to stop a crisis that threatens multiple universes.\n\n===Music===\n\n\"Ballad of Barry Allen\"\u2014A song by the band [[Jim's Big Ego]] on their album, ''They're Everywhere''. The song portrays Barry as a tragic character, whose perception of the world is so accelerated that all of reality appears to proceed at a snail's pace, causing him to gradually slip into depression. The band's frontman, [[Jim Infantino]], is the nephew of Flash (Barry Allen) co-creator [[Carmine Infantino]], who provided the cover art for the same album.\n\n==Reception==\n[[IGN]] ranked Barry as the 49th greatest hero of all time stating that even in his 20-year absence, Barry's legacy as the greatest Flash of them all lived on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/49 |title=Barry Allen (The Flash) is number 49 |accessdate=May 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508013024/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/49 |archivedate=May 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Barry Allen placed 8th on [[IGN]]'s Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schedeen |first=Jesse |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |title=The Top 25 Heroes of DC Comics |publisher=IGN |date=2013-11-19 |accessdate=2015-11-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102013528/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/the-top-25-heroes-of-dc-comics |archivedate=2015-11-02 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|Flash_Intro.ogg|2008-04-16}}\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/6jOaTZseg?url=http://toonopedia.com/flash2.htm Flash (1956)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]].  from the original on July 30, 2016.\n* {{cite web| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323061055/http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2006/01/kistlers_profil_2.shtml | first=Alan|last= Kistler | title= Profile On: The Flash&nbsp;\u2013 Part 2| publisher= MonitorDuty.com| date = January 11, 2006| archivedate= March 23, 2006| url= http://www.monitorduty.com/mdarchives/2006/01/kistlers_profil_2.shtml}}\n* [http://arrow.wikia.com/wiki/Barry_Allen Arrowverse entry for The Flash]\n\n{{Flash}}\n{{Justice League}}\n{{Justice League characters}}\n{{Green Lantern}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by John Broome]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Carmine Infantino]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Robert Kanigher]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1956]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible]]\n[[Category:DC Comics characters with accelerated healing]]\n[[Category:DC Comics television characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with electric or magnetic abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional forensic scientists]]\n[[Category:Central City Police Department officers]]\n[[Category:Fictional chemists]]\n[[Category:Flash (DC comics) characters]]\n[[Category:Male characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Superhero television characters]]\n[[Category:Time travelers]]\n[[Category:DC Comics metahumans]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate time]]\n", "name_user": "2405:204:140c:e692:58de:6e0f:52e1:5a9d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_(Barry_Allen)"}

Prior to the election, the Republican Party controlled 55 of the 100 [[United States Senate|Senate]] seats.\n\nThe Senate elections were part of the Democratic sweep of the [[2006 United States general elections|2006 elections]], in which Democrats made numerous gains and no congressional or gubernatorial seat held by a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] was won by a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Democratic sweep may be long-lasting |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |author=Don Rose |date=December 26, 2006 |accessdate=April 9, 2014 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-12-26/news/0612260098_1_senate-vote-latino-vote-democrats}}</ref> One Democratic incumbent however was defeated in a primary but then went on to be reelected on a third party ticket. Because of this, this is the first time since the 1970 Senate elections in which a member of a third party, who is not an independent, was elected to the Senate. The lone Independent retired but was succeeded by another Independent, retaining their presence in the Senate. This election was also the first midterm election since the [[1990 United States Senate elections|1990 midterms]] and the most recent one to date in which Senate Democrats made net gains and the first midterm election in which they made more than one net gain since [[1988 United States Senate elections|1988]].\n\nFollowing the elections, no party held a majority of seats for the first time since [[1954 United States Senate elections|January 1955]].  The Democrats were able to control the chamber because the two Independents [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|caucused with the Democrats]]. The Democrats needed at least 51 seats to control the Senate because [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] would have [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|broken any 50\u201350 tie]] in favor of the Republicans.

Kyl's Democratic opponent for the general election was wealthy real-estate developer [[Jim Pederson (businessman and politician)|Jim Pederson]], who served as the Arizona Democratic Party Chairman from 2001 to 2005. During his tenure, Pederson spent millions of dollars of his own money to help Democrats modernize and to elect [[Janet Napolitano]] as [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor of Arizona]]. The deadline for signing petition signatures to appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot was June 14, 2006.\n\nNot long after the 2004 election, Pederson's name began being mentioned as a potential Senate candidate for the 2006 race. On July 28, 2005, Pederson formally stepped down as Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, further fueling those speculations. In early September 2005, an e-mail was sent from the Arizona Democratic Party's website, inviting people to an announcement by Pederson on September 7. In an anticlimactic move, an e-mail was sent out shortly after the first saying that the announcement would be postponed due to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. It was requested that any money that would be donated to Pederson's campaign at the announcement be directed to relief efforts instead. Similarly, a meeting in Arizona of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) was scheduled for around the same time. It was also postponed and the same request was made involving donations. On September 7, 2005, Pederson filed to run for the U.S. Senate. On September 14, 2005, Pederson formally announced his intention to run, in his hometown of [[Casa Grande, Arizona]].\n\nAlthough Kyl started the campaign with a sizable lead in most polls, the gap quickly narrowed, especially after Pederson released his array of ads.\n\nPederson lost the election by 9.84% or 150,257 votes, despite Democratic Incumbent Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] easily being re-elected and winning every county statewide. While Pederson lost it was still notable, as it was the worst performance of Senator Kyl's career. Kyl did well as Republicans usually do in [[Maricopa County]] home of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Pederson did well in [[Pima County]] home of [[Tucson]] which tends to support Democrats. Kyl was called the winner by [[CNN]] at around 8 P.M. local time, 11 P.M. EST. Pederson called Senator Kyl and conceded defeat at 9:02 P.M. local time, 12:02 P.M. EST.\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Arizona general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2006/2006Stat.htm#3|title=2006 Election Statistics|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jon Kyl]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 814,398\n | percentage = 53.34%\n | change     = -25.98%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Pederson (businessman and politician)|Jim Pederson]]\n | votes      = 664,141\n | percentage = 43.50%\n | change     = +43.50%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Richard Mack]]\n | votes      = 48,231\n | percentage = 3.16%\n | change     = -1.90%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  =\n | votes      =13\n | percentage = 0.00%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 150,257\n | percentage = 9.84%\n | change     = 61.66%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 1,526,782\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n | winner = Republican Party (US)\n | swing =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== California ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = California election\n| country           = California\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in California\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in California\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = DianneFeinstein.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Dianne Feinstein]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''5,076,289'''\n| percentage1       = '''59.43%'''\n| image2            = Dick Mountjoy.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Dick Mountjoy]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 2,990,822\n| percentage2       = 35.02%\n| map_image         = California2006SenateResultsShaded.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Dianne Feinstein]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Dianne Feinstein]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in California}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from California}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Dianne Feinstein]] won re-election to her third full term.\n\nFeinstein stood against Republican [[Dick Mountjoy]], who had never held a statewide elected position, but had been a state senator for several years.

The primary was held June 13, 2006. Olympia Snowe was unopposed for the Republican nomination; Jean Hay Bright narrowly won the Democratic nod with 50.7% of the vote against Eric Mehnert.\n\nHay Bright announced her candidacy in May 2005. Hay Bright was previously an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination to the House in [[U.S. House election, 1994 House election|1994]] and the Senate in [[U.S. Senate election, 1996 Senate election|1996]].\n\nThe race had been called by [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/youdecide2006/races.html?ME FOX News] for Snowe 23 minutes after the polls had closed. Snowe won re-election by a greater margin than any U.S. Senator that cycle except [[Indiana|Indiana's]] [[Richard Lugar]], who faced only a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] opponent. Snowe won in all of Maine's counties, taking at least 60% of the vote in each region.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Maine general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/2006g/gen06s.html|title=Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions, Elections Division<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Olympia Snowe (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 402,598\n | percentage = 74.01%\n | change     = +5.5%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Jean Hay Bright\n | votes      = 111,984\n | percentage = 20.59%\n | change     = -10.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Independent (US)\n | candidate  = Bill Slavick\n | votes      = 29,220\n | percentage = 5.37%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 290,614\n | percentage = 53.42%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 543,802\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n | winner = Republican Party (US)\n | swing =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Maryland ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Maryland election\n| country           = Maryland\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Maryland\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Maryland\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Ben Cardin portrait.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Ben Cardin]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''965,477'''\n| percentage1       = '''54.2%'''\n| image2            = Michael Steele.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Michael Steele]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 787,182\n| percentage2       = 44.2%\n| map_image         = MDSen06Counties.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Paul Sarbanes]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Ben Cardin]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Maryland}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Maryland}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Paul Sarbanes]], Maryland's longest serving United States senator, decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term.

In July 2006, unemployment in Michigan stood at approximately 7%, compared with a 4.7% rate nationwide. Pessimism about the state's economic future had left Michigan ranked 49th nationally between 2000 and 2005 in retaining young adults. Since its peak, Detroit had lost over a million people.

President Bush even came to [[Michigan]] to campaign for Bouchard, raising over $1,000,000 dollars for him. However Bouchard never won a single poll. By October the Republican Party, started taking resources out of Michigan to focus on closer races, essentially ceding the race to Stabenow. Stabenow would go on to win the election easily, capturing nearly 57% of the vote. Stabenow did well throughout Michigan, but performed better in heavily populated cities like [[Detroit]], [[Oakland]], [[Lansing]], [[Ann Arbor]], and [[Kalamazoo]]. Bouchard did win [[Grand Rapids]], a typical Republican area. He also won in many rural areas around the state. However Bouchard failed to put a dent in Stabenow's lead, largely due to her strong performance in heavily populated areas. Bouchard conceded to Stabenow at 9:58 P.M.

Carnahan had been appointed to the Senate seat following the posthumous election of her husband [[Mel Carnahan]], who had died in a plane crash shortly before the [[2000 United States Senate elections|2000 election]]. Talent's Democratic opponent was Missouri State Auditor [[Claire McCaskill]]. Early on the morning of November 8, Talent conceded defeat to McCaskill, [[2006 United States elections|having faced considerable political headwinds]]. Talent lost the election with 47% of the vote, to 50% of the vote for McCaskill.\n\nThe election was always expected to be very close, which seems fitting for a seat that has changed hands twice, both by very narrow margins, within the last six years. In 2000, the late [[List of Governors of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[Mel Carnahan]], a Democrat, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator [[John Ashcroft]] 50% to 48%. Two years later in a special election held for the seat, incumbent Senator [[Jean Carnahan]] lost an even closer election to former Congressman Talent, 50% to 49%.\n\nMissouri was seen as [[Missouri bellwether|the nation's bellwether state]] throughout the 20th century: It had voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1900, except for 1956 (when the state narrowly favored [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] over [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]). Missouri's bellwether status was due to the fact that it not only voted for the electoral victor, but that its returns usually mirrored national returns.\n\nThe state itself is a geographically central state, bordered by both the edges of Southern and [[Midwestern]] regions. In statewide contests for much of the 20th century, Missouri favored the Democratic Party. In recent elections, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) has emerged in statewide contests. The election of 2004 was an important one; as [[George W. Bush]] was re-elected he carried Missouri. But this time his margin in the state was greater than it was nationwide. Bush won the [[Presidency]] 51% to 48%, he carried Missouri 53% to 46%. This trend had begun in 2000, when Bush lost the national popular vote to [[Al Gore]] 47% to 48% but still won Missouri, 50% to 47%. Bush's victory also saw Republicans triumph in several statewide contests; Senator [[Kit Bond]] was re-elected by a decisive 56% to 43% margin and [[Matt Blunt]] won the election for Governor, narrowly defeating state auditor [[Claire McCaskill]] 51% to 48%. The GOP also captured control of the state legislature for the first time in eighty years.\n\nTalent, anticipating a tough re-election battle and attempting to dissuade challengers, had accumulated a large campaign fund.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=MO&Year=2006 | website = OpenSecrets.org | title = Missouri Congressional Races in 2006 | publisher = Center for Responsive Politics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110003801/http://www.opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=MO&Year=2006 |archive-date=January 10, 2007 |access-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref> For most of 2005, he had no opposition. State Senator [[Chuck Graham]] had briefly entered the race early in the year, but dropped out soon after. However, on August 30, 2005, Democrat Claire McCaskill announced her intention to run for Talent's Senate seat.\n\nMcCaskill started with a large financial disadvantage, but she was also an experienced candidate with high name recognition. McCaskill had run two successful campaigns for state auditor. She was also a candidate for governor in 2004, when she defeated the incumbent Democratic Governor [[Bob Holden]] in the [[primary election]] but lost with 48% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBoth Talent and McCaskill faced unknowns in their respective primaries on August 8, 2006, and defeated them soundly.\n\nThe Missouri contest was seen as vitally important to control of the [[United States Senate]]; as a toss-up election between two strong candidates, the race was expected to attract a lot of interest as well as money spent on ads and turning out supporters. If Talent won, then a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate depended upon victories in [[2006 Tennessee United States Senate election|Tennessee]], where the Republican Bob Corker won, and [[2006 Virginia United States Senate election|Virginia]], where Democrat Jim Webb won; the Democrats needed to win six seats to take control of the chamber with 51 seats. To do this, they would need to retain their 19 incumbent seats, win the four Republican-held seats of [[2006 Montana United States Senate election|Montana]], [[2006 Ohio United States Senate election|Ohio]], [[2006 Rhode Island United States Senate election|Rhode Island]], and [[2006 Pennsylvania United States Senate election|Pennsylvania]] (where Democratic chances seemed above 50%, and Democrats won all 4.) and two of the following three \"toss-up\" races: Missouri, [[2006 Tennessee United States Senate election|Tennessee]] and [[2006 Virginia United States Senate election|Virginia]].\n\nIt is believed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that statewide ballot issues drove the November 2006 vote. Talent was on the opposite of the majority of voters in this poll on just about every issue: 66% of Missouri voters favored raising the [[minimum wage]] to $6.50 an hour; 62% of Missouri voters favored raising taxes to replace [[Medicaid]] funding cut by the current Republican Governor, [[Matt Blunt]]; 54% opposed a law that would require all Missourians to show a photo ID before they vote; 58% favored campaign donation limitations; and 66% favored restoring Medicaid coverage to about 90,000 Missourians who lost coverage when Blunt and the Republican legislature tightened eligibility requirements.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, 62% favored a ballot proposal that would allow all types of embryonic stem cell research allowed under federal law - a measure Talent had recently announced that he was against.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/8CD39743858142E086257197005F0EAB?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808190341/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/8CD39743858142E086257197005F0EAB?OpenDocument |archive-date=August 8, 2006 | title = Senate race tied to state issues | first = Jo | last = Mannies | date = June 24, 2006 | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch}}</ref>\n\nOn election night the race was, as expected, too close to call. With 85% of the vote in and with still no call, McCaskill claimed victory. At the time McCaskill declared victory, she was ahead by a vote margin of 867,683 to Talent's 842,251 votes; in percentage terms, with 85% of the vote in, McCaskill led Talent, 49% to 48%. Finally, at 11:38 P.M. Central Time the [[Associated Press]] called McCaskill as the winner. [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], adjacent to [[St. Louis]], and [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], home of [[Kansas City]], are probably what pushed McCaskill over the finish line.\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Missouri general election\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Claire McCaskill]]\n | votes      = 1,055,255\n | percentage = 49.6%\n | change     = +0.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Talent]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 1,006,941\n | percentage = 47.3%\n | change     = -2.5%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Frank Gilmour]]\n | votes      = 47,792\n | percentage = 2.2%\n | change     = +1.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Progressive Party (Missouri)\n | candidate  = [[Lydia Lewis]]\n | votes      = 18,383\n | percentage = 0.9%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  =\n | votes      = 88\n | percentage = 0.0%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box plurality\n | votes      = 48,314\n | percentage = 2.3%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 2,128,459\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link\n | winner     = Democratic Party (US)\n | loser      = Republican Party (US)\n | swing      =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Montana ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Montana election\n| country           = Montana\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Montana\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Montana\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Jon Tester, official 110th Congress photo.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Jon Tester]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''199,845'''\n| percentage1       = '''49.16%'''\n| image2            = Conrad Burns official portrait.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Conrad Burns]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 196,283\n| percentage2       = 48.29%\n| map_image         = MTSen06County.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Conrad Burns]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Jon Tester]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Montana}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Montana}}\nIncumbent Republican [[Conrad Burns]] was running for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Democrat [[Jon Tester]], [[President of the Senate|President]] of the [[Montana State Senate]], by a margin of 0.87%, or 3,562 votes out of 406,505 votes.\n\nBurns was first elected as a United States senator from Montana in 1988, when he defeated Democratic incumbent [[John Melcher]] in a close race, 51% to 48%.

In early 2006, the [[Club for Growth]], a pro-tax cut [[political action committee]], sent a series of mailings to Rhode Island Republicans attacking Chafee's positions and voting record.\n\nThe national GOP supported Chafee in the primary campaign, believing that he was the most likely candidate to hold the seat in the general election. [[Mitch McConnell|Senator Mitch McConnell]] of [[Kentucky]], [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] and [[Laura Bush]] appeared at fundraisers for Chafee, while [[Bill Frist|Senator Bill Frist's]] [[political action committee|PAC]] donated to Chafee. The [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] also ran ads in the state supporting Chafee. Steve Laffey, however, picked up many endorsements from Republican town committees throughout Rhode Island, the national group [[Club for Growth]], and former candidate for the party's Presidential nomination [[Steve Forbes]]. On July 10, 2006, the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] filed a complaint with the [[Federal Election Commission]] against Laffey, saying that he had included a political communication in tax bills mailed to [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] of Cranston.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gopsenators.com/nrscwebimages/Laffey-CityofCranston-FECComplaint.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060921212031/http://www.gopsenators.com/nrscwebimages/Laffey-CityofCranston-FECComplaint.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = September 21, 2006 | title = NRSC | publisher = Gopsenators.com | accessdate = November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Republican primary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.ri.us/elections/results/2006/primary/statesummary.php|title=Rhode Island Board of Elections: Elections & Voting|website=elections.state.ri.us|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Lincoln Chafee (Incumbent)\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | votes      = 34,936\n | percentage = 54%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Steve Laffey\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | votes      = 29,547\n | percentage = 46%\n}}\n{{Election box total no change\n | votes      = 64,483\n | percentage = 100.00%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nDemocrats believed that this was one of the most likely Senate seats to switch party control, due to the Democratic tilt of Rhode Island, as well as the fact that Chafee needed to expend part of his campaign fund to win the Republican primary election. Chafee's approval ratings also took a beating from his primary battle with Laffey and may have hurt him in the general election. Another factor that hurt Chafee was the fact that Whitehouse, the Democratic nominee, had a huge head start on him, as he was able to campaign with little opposition for at least half the year and had not had to contend with a major opponent until the general election campaign. Rhode Islanders' historically large disapproval ratings for President Bush and the Republican Party as a whole was another major hurdle for Chafee.\n\nWhitehouse and Chafee very rarely disagreed on political issues. Socially, they agreed almost 100% of the time. Chafee was against the [[Bush tax cuts]], indicating his ideology was [[Liberalism|liberal]]-leaning. On some fiscal issues they disagreed on such as on social security and free trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issues2000.org/Senate/Sheldon_Whitehouse.htm|title=Sheldon Whitehouse on the Issues|first=|last=OnTheIssues.org|website=issues2000.org|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Lincoln_Chafee.htm | title = Lincoln Chafee on the Issues | publisher = Ontheissues.org | accessdate = November 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Rhode Island general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2006/2006Stat.htm#39|title=2006 Election Statistics|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Sheldon Whitehouse]]\n | votes      = 206,043\n | percentage = 53.52%\n | change     = +12.37%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Lincoln Chafee]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 178,950\n | percentage = 46.48%\n | change     = -10.40%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 27,093\n | percentage = 7.04%\n | change     = -8.69%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 384,993\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link\n | winner     = Democratic Party (US)\n | loser      = Republican Party (US)\n | swing      =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nWhitehouse carried Providence County, which contains approximately 60% of the state's population, with 59% to Chafee's 41%.

That was likely because:\n* Even in large jurisdictions, recounts \u2014 such as those in [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida in 2000]] and [[2004 Washington gubernatorial election|Washington's 2004 gubernatorial election]] \u2014 rarely result in a swing of more than 1,000 votes, and Allen was trailing by almost 10,000 in the initial count. In particular, almost all votes in this Virginia election were cast using electronic voting machines, whose results are unlikely to change in a recount.\n* There was wide speculation that calling for a recount (and still losing) would give Allen a \"sore loser\" label, which would hurt his future election campaigns, including what some speculated might still involve a [[Official and Potential 2008 United States presidential election Republican candidates|2008 presidential run]]. However, after losing the senatorial election, on December 10, 2006, Allen announced that he would not be running for president in 2008.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Washington ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Washington election\n| country           = Washington\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Washington\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Washington\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Maria Cantwell, official portrait, 110th Congress (cropped).jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Maria Cantwell]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''1,184,659'''\n| percentage1       = '''56.9%'''\n| image2            = Mike McGavick.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Mike McGavick]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 832,106\n| percentage2       = 39.9%\n| map_image         = File:Washington Senate Election Results by County 2006.svg|thumb|Washington senate election 2006\n| map_size          = 250px\n| map_caption       = County results\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\nCantwell\n{{legend|#b9d7ff|40-50%}}\n{{legend|#86b6f2|50-60%}}\n{{legend|#4389e3|60-70%}}\n{{col-2}}\nMcGavick\n{{legend|#f2b3be|40-50%}}\n{{legend|#e27f90|50-60%}}\n{{legend|#cc2f4a|60-70%}}\n{{col-end}}\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Maria Cantwell]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Maria Cantwell]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Washington}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Washington}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Maria Cantwell]] won re-election to a second term.\n\nThe filing deadline was July 28, 2006, with the primary held September 19, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.politics1.com/wa.htm | title = Washington | author = Ron Gunzburger | date = March 8, 2005 | website = Politics1.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316213129/http://www.politics1.com/wa.htm | archivedate = March 16, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> Cantwell consistently led in polling throughout the race, although political analysts saw her as vulnerable this election cycle due to her extremely narrow win in 2000 and discontent among progressive voters.

The governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer, state auditor, and insurance commissioner are Democrats, while only secretary of state, attorney general, and commissioner of public lands are Republican. Of the nine representatives Washington sends to the House of Representatives, six are Democrats. Democrat [[Patty Murray]] is the state's senior senator. Cantwell won her initial election to the Senate in 2000 over [[Slade Gorton]] by 2,229 votes. Due to the closeness of that race, and the close gubernatorial contest between Democrat [[Christine Gregoire]] and Republican [[Dino Rossi]] in November 2004, many Republicans believed they had a strong chance of capturing Cantwell's seat in 2006.\n\nOn March 9, 2006, [[Aaron Dixon]] announced his decision to seek the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party's]] nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging Cantwell on her continued support for the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|U.S. presence in Iraq]] and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. On May 13, 2006, Mr. Dixon secured the party's nomination at the Green Party of Washington state's Spring Convention.\n\nInitially, Cantwell had two challengers from within the Democratic primary, both of them taking strong stances against the Iraq war that brought attention to Cantwell's votes for the Iraq Resolution and against a timeline for withdrawal. Three other Democrats also entered the primary race.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, the incumbent Democratic Senator from Connecticut, [[Joe Lieberman]], lost his primary race to challenger [[Ned Lamont]] by 52%-48%, and appears to be following through on his earlier commitment to run as an Independent in the general election. A great deal of attention has focused on this race, as an early barometer of both anti-incumbent and anti-war sentiment nationwide. Comparisons have been made between Lieberman's troubles and Cantwell's re-election bid, citing Cantwell's vote in favor of the [[Iraq Resolution]] that led to the war, her refusal to say she regretted the vote, and her vote against a timetable for withdrawal.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lieberman Explains His Stance on Iraq|author1= Patrick Healy|author2= Jennifer Medina | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/nyregion/07campaign.html?_r=1&ref=washington&oref=slogin | newspaper = The New York Times | date = August 7, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Nutmeg State Democrats Choose Lamont | author = SethGitell | url = http://www.nysun.com/article/37604?page_no=1 | newspaper = The New York Sun | date = August 9, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Lamont's campaign, Cantwell's anti-war opponents' campaigns have received much less funding and have not had the same support from the blogosphere that brought Lamont to prominence and improved his name recognition. Also, unlike Lieberman, Cantwell has altered her position on the war during her campaign and criticized the Bush Administration for its conduct of the war. She also hired her most vocal anti-war primary opponent, Mark Wilson, at $8,000-a-month salary, a move that was described by political commentators as \"buying out\" the opposition (which she also allegedly attempted with other anti-war challengers Hong Tran and Aaron Dixon).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://soundpolitics.com/archives/006979.html | title = Did Senator Cantwell try to co-opt another opponent?|last1= Earling|first1= Eric | date = September 25, 2006 | website = Sound Politics | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> The article does, however, note that, despite the differences in exact circumstances, the Lieberman defeat also shows that voters are in an anti-incumbent mood, which could create problems for Cantwell.<ref>{{cite news | title = Anti-war liberals blast Cantwell | author = Neil Modie | url = http://seattlepi.com/local/280737_cantwell10.html | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = August 9, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> This is supported by another P-I article that also notes that the primary loss of Lieberman and two [[United States House of Representatives|House]] incumbents, Michigan Republican [[Joe Schwarz]] and Georgia Democrat [[Cynthia McKinney]], on the same day indicates that there may be a nationwide anti-incumbent trend.<ref>[http://seattlepi.com/national/1130AP_Incumbents_Beware.html]{{dead link | date = September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the primary results, Cantwell endorsed Ned Lamont and McGavick responded by endorsing Senator Lieberman.{{citation needed | date=November 2017}} The Dixon campaign released a statement criticizing Cantwell's \"spin and vague rhetoric\" on the war, and equating her current position to a pro-war stance similar to Lieberman's.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gp.org/press/states/wa_2006_08_16.shtml | title=Cantwell Can't Hide Her Pro-War Record With Spin and Vague Rhetoric, Says Dixon | publisher=Green Party of the United States | date=August 11, 2006 | accessdate=September 19, 2013 | archive-date=September 19, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919015907/http://www.gp.org//press/states/wa_2006_08_16.shtml | author=Green Party of the United States | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all | work=gp.org/}}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, less than a week after Lamont's win and nearly four years after the actual event, Cantwell for the first time said she would have voted against the authorization to use force in Iraq if she knew then what she knows today.<ref name=\"frist\">{{cite news | title = Frist backs McGavick but not all his views | author = David Postman | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003199347_frist15m.html | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = August 15, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> However, she did so only after hearing her opponent McGavick say that he would have voted against the authorization under those conditions.<ref name=\"fryer\">{{cite news | title = Should we leave Iraq?

In 2000, then Republican Governor [[George W. Bush]] of [[Texas]] won West Virginia's five [[United States Electoral College|electoral college votes]] over then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] of [[Tennessee]] by a margin of 52-46. Also in the 2000 election, Republican [[Shelley Moore Capito]], the daughter of Former [[List of Governors of West Virginia|West Virginia Governor]] [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.]], won a surprise victory over Democrat [[Jim Humphreys (West Virginia politician)|Jim Humphreys]] for [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district|West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District seat]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. She would become the first Republican in West Virginia to hold a [[United States Congressional Delegations from West Virginia|Congressional office]] for more than one term since her father in 1969. Before these two major victories for national and West Virginia Republicans, it was difficult to find a Republican who could mount a formidable campaign against Democrats running for public office in West Virginia.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] Bush won West Virginia again in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] over [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], the Democratic [[Junior senator|junior]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[United States Congressional Delegations from Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] by a margin of 56-43. Both [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Alan Mollohan]] (D-[[West Virginia's 1st congressional district|1st District]]) and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Nick Rahall]] (D-[[West Virginia's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]]) had more formidable challenges from Republicans when compared to 2000 and 2002. Republican [[Brent Benjamin]] defeated Democratic incumbent [[West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] Justice [[Warren McGraw]], and Republican [[Betty Ireland]] defeated liberal-Democrat [[Ken Hechler]], a former congressman and secretary of state, for [[West Virginia Secretary of State]].\n\nSince 2000, the Republicans have gained seven net seats in both the [[West Virginia Senate]] and the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]]. However, the Democrats hold 60% of the seats in the Senate and 68% of the seats in the House.\n\nAlong with continued majorities in the legislature, Democrats have also had some other victories. Even though both Bush and Capito won their respective offices in 2000, Senator Byrd sailed to an eighth term with 78% of the vote over Republican [[David Gallaher (politician)|David Gallaher]]. Senator [[Jay Rockefeller|John D. Rockefeller, IV]], easily won a fourth term to the Senate in [[2002 United States Senate elections|2002]] by a margin of 63-37 over Republican [[Jay Wolfe]]. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, both Representative Mollohan and Representative Rahall were re-elected by much stronger margins than Capito. In 2004, Republican [[Monty Warner]] failed to defeat Democratic [[West Virginia Secretary of State]] [[Joe Manchin]] for governor.\n\nAfter the Republicans failed to win the governor's race, West Virginia Republican Committee Chairman [[Kris Warner]], the brother of Monty, was put under pressure to resign his post; he did so in May 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=2679|title=Warner to Quit as GOP Chairman - WOWK-TV - WOWKTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001030122/http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=2679|archive-date=October 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wheeling attorney [[Rob Capehart]] took his place.

On October 27, 2005, however, Ireland announced she would not run against the eight-term senator. She said that the office of Secretary of State should not be used as a political stepping stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=6227|title=Secretary of State Betty Ireland Won't Challenge Byrd - WOWK-TV - WOWKTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513110722/http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=6227|archive-date=May 13, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Ironically, [[Joe Manchin]] held the office of Secretary of State during his campaign for governor.\n\nConservative columnist [[Robert Novak]] wrote in a September 24, 2005, article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/robertnovak/2005/09/24/155691.html|title=Robert Novak Articles - Political Columnist & Commentator - Robert Novak|website=Townhall|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> that [[Gale Catlett]]'s, the former Head Coach of the [[West Virginia University]] Men's Basketball team, name had been floated around as a possible challenger to Byrd.

Because of this, this is the first time since the 1970 Senate elections in which a member of a third party, who is not an independent, was elected to the Senate. The lone Independent retired but was succeeded by another Independent, retaining their presence in the Senate. This election was also the first midterm election since the [[1990 United States Senate elections|1990 midterms]] and the most recent one to date in which Senate Democrats made net gains and the first midterm election in which they made more than one net gain since [[1988 United States Senate elections|1988]].\n\nFollowing the elections, no party held a majority of seats for the first time since [[1954 United States Senate elections|January 1955]].  The Democrats were able to control the chamber because the two Independents [[Party caucuses and conferences in the United States Congress|caucused with the Democrats]]. The Democrats needed at least 51 seats to control the Senate because [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] would have [[List of tie-breaking votes cast by Vice Presidents of the United States|broken any 50\u201350 tie]] in favor of the Republicans. This was the first time since 2000 where the Democrats effectively won control of the Senate as a result of elections.\n\nAs of 2019, this is the last time Democrats won a Senate election in [[2006 United States Senate election in Nebraska|Nebraska]].\n\n== Results summary ==\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ \u2193\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:49%;\" | '''49'''\n| style=\"background:{{Independent (US)/meta/color}}; color:black; width:2%;\" | '''2'''\n| style=\"background:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}; width:49%;\" | '''49'''\n|}\n{| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:49%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Democratic Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Democratic'''</span>\n| '''Independent'''\n| style=\"width:49%;\"| <span style=\"color:{{Republican Party (US)/meta/color}}\">'''Republican'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{2006 United States Senate elections results}}\n\n== Gains and losses ==\n[[File:110th US Congress Senate.svg|thumb|375px|'''Senate composition following the 2006 elections'''\n{{legend|#0044aa|2 Democrats}}\n{{legend|#aa0000|2 Republicans}}\n{{legend|#660080|1 Democrat and 1 Republican}}\n{{colorsample|#87aade}}{{colorsample|#3771c8}}1 Democrat and 1 Independent]]\n[[File:2006 US Senate election results by county.png|thumb|Results of the Senate elections by county]]\nSix Republican incumbents were defeated by Democrats:\n\n*[[Jim Talent]] ([[#Missouri|Missouri]]) lost to [[Claire McCaskill]]\n*[[Conrad Burns]] ([[#Montana|Montana]]) lost to [[Jon Tester]]\n*[[Mike DeWine]] ([[#Ohio|Ohio]]) lost to [[Sherrod Brown]]\n*[[Rick Santorum]] ([[#Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]) lost to [[Bob Casey Jr.]]\n*[[Lincoln Chafee]] ([[#Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]) lost to [[Sheldon Whitehouse]]\n*[[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] ([[#Virginia|Virginia]]) lost to [[Jim Webb]]\n\n== Holds ==\nDemocrats kept their two [[Incumbent#In politics|open seats]] in [[#Minnesota|Minnesota]] and [[#Maryland|Maryland]], and Republicans held onto their lone open seat in [[#Tennessee|Tennessee]].\n\nIndependent [[Bernie Sanders]] was elected to the open seat in [[#Vermont|Vermont]] to replace Independent incumbent [[Jim Jeffords]], who retired.

Kyl's Democratic opponent for the general election was wealthy real-estate developer [[Jim Pederson (businessman and politician)|Jim Pederson]], who served as the Arizona Democratic Party Chairman from 2001 to 2005. During his tenure, Pederson spent millions of dollars of his own money to help Democrats modernize and to elect [[Janet Napolitano]] as [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor of Arizona]]. The deadline for signing petition signatures to appear on the September 12, 2006 primary ballot was June 14, 2006.\n\nNot long after the 2004 election, Pederson's name began being mentioned as a potential Senate candidate for the 2006 race. On July 28, 2005, Pederson formally stepped down as Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, further fueling those speculations. In early September 2005, an e-mail was sent from the Arizona Democratic Party's website, inviting people to an announcement by Pederson on September 7. In an anticlimactic move, an e-mail was sent out shortly after the first saying that the announcement would be postponed due to [[Hurricane Katrina]]. It was requested that any money that would be donated to Pederson's campaign at the announcement be directed to relief efforts instead. Similarly, a meeting in Arizona of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) was scheduled for around the same time. It was also postponed and the same request was made involving donations. On September 7, 2005, Pederson filed to run for the U.S. Senate. On September 14, 2005, Pederson formally announced his intention to run, in his hometown of [[Casa Grande, Arizona]].\n\nAlthough Kyl started the campaign with a sizable lead in most polls, the gap quickly narrowed, especially after Pederson released his array of ads.\n\nPederson lost the election by 9.84% or 150,257 votes, despite Democratic Incumbent Governor [[Janet Napolitano]] easily being re-elected and winning every county statewide. While Pederson lost it was still notable, as it was the worst performance of Senator Kyl's career. Kyl did well as Republicans usually do in [[Maricopa County]] home of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Pederson did well in [[Pima County]] home of [[Tucson]] which tends to support Democrats. Kyl was called the winner by [[CNN]] at around 8 P.M. local time, 11 P.M. EST. Pederson called Senator Kyl and conceded defeat at 9:02 P.M. local time, 12:02 P.M. EST.\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Arizona general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2006/2006Stat.htm#3|title=2006 Election Statistics|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jon Kyl]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 814,398\n | percentage = 53.34%\n | change     = -25.98%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Pederson (businessman and politician)|Jim Pederson]]\n | votes      = 664,141\n | percentage = 43.50%\n | change     = +43.50%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Richard Mack]]\n | votes      = 48,231\n | percentage = 3.16%\n | change     = -1.90%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  =\n | votes      =13\n | percentage = 0.00%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 150,257\n | percentage = 9.84%\n | change     = 61.66%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 1,526,782\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n | winner = Republican Party (US)\n | swing =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== California ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = California election\n| country           = California\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in California\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in California\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = DianneFeinstein.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Dianne Feinstein]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''5,076,289'''\n| percentage1       = '''59.43%'''\n| image2            = Dick Mountjoy.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Dick Mountjoy]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 2,990,822\n| percentage2       = 35.02%\n| map_image         = California2006SenateResultsShaded.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Dianne Feinstein]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Dianne Feinstein]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in California}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from California}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Dianne Feinstein]] won re-election to her third full term.\n\nFeinstein stood against Republican [[Dick Mountjoy]], who had never held a statewide elected position, but had been a state senator for several years.

The primary was held June 13, 2006. Olympia Snowe was unopposed for the Republican nomination; Jean Hay Bright narrowly won the Democratic nod with 50.7% of the vote against Eric Mehnert.\n\nHay Bright announced her candidacy in May 2005. Hay Bright was previously an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination to the House in [[U.S. House election, 1994 House election|1994]] and the Senate in [[U.S. Senate election, 1996 Senate election|1996]].\n\nThe race had been called by [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/youdecide2006/races.html?ME FOX News] for Snowe 23 minutes after the polls had closed. Snowe won re-election by a greater margin than any U.S. Senator that cycle except [[Indiana|Indiana's]] [[Richard Lugar]], who faced only a [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] opponent. Snowe won in all of Maine's counties, taking at least 60% of the vote in each region.\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Maine general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/2006g/gen06s.html|title=Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions, Elections Division<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = Olympia Snowe (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 402,598\n | percentage = 74.01%\n | change     = +5.5%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = Jean Hay Bright\n | votes      = 111,984\n | percentage = 20.59%\n | change     = -10.6%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Independent (US)\n | candidate  = Bill Slavick\n | votes      = 29,220\n | percentage = 5.37%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 290,614\n | percentage = 53.42%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 543,802\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box hold with party link\n | winner = Republican Party (US)\n | swing =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Maryland ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Maryland election\n| country           = Maryland\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Maryland\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Maryland\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Ben Cardin portrait.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Ben Cardin]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''965,477'''\n| percentage1       = '''54.2%'''\n| image2            = Michael Steele.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Michael Steele]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 787,182\n| percentage2       = 44.2%\n| map_image         = MDSen06Counties.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Paul Sarbanes]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Ben Cardin]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Maryland}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Maryland}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Paul Sarbanes]], Maryland's longest serving United States senator, decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term.

In July 2006, unemployment in Michigan stood at approximately 7%, compared with a 4.7% rate nationwide. Pessimism about the state's economic future had left Michigan ranked 49th nationally between 2000 and 2005 in retaining young adults. Since its peak, Detroit had lost over a million people.

President Bush even came to [[Michigan]] to campaign for Bouchard, raising over $1,000,000 dollars for him. However Bouchard never won a single poll. By October the Republican Party, started taking resources out of Michigan to focus on closer races, essentially ceding the race to Stabenow. Stabenow would go on to win the election easily, capturing nearly 57% of the vote. Stabenow did well throughout Michigan, but performed better in heavily populated cities like [[Detroit]], [[Oakland]], [[Lansing]], [[Ann Arbor]], and [[Kalamazoo]]. Bouchard did win [[Grand Rapids]], a typical Republican area. He also won in many rural areas around the state. However Bouchard failed to put a dent in Stabenow's lead, largely due to her strong performance in heavily populated areas. Bouchard conceded to Stabenow at 9:58 P.M.

Carnahan had been appointed to the Senate seat following the posthumous election of her husband [[Mel Carnahan]], who had died in a plane crash shortly before the [[2000 United States Senate elections|2000 election]]. Talent's Democratic opponent was Missouri State Auditor [[Claire McCaskill]]. Early on the morning of November 8, Talent conceded defeat to McCaskill, [[2006 United States elections|having faced considerable political headwinds]]. Talent lost the election with 47% of the vote, to 50% of the vote for McCaskill.\n\nThe election was always expected to be very close, which seems fitting for a seat that has changed hands twice, both by very narrow margins, within the last six years. In 2000, the late [[List of Governors of Missouri|Missouri Governor]] [[Mel Carnahan]], a Democrat, narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Senator [[John Ashcroft]] 50% to 48%. Two years later in a special election held for the seat, incumbent Senator [[Jean Carnahan]] lost an even closer election to former Congressman Talent, 50% to 49%.\n\nMissouri was seen as [[Missouri bellwether|the nation's bellwether state]] throughout the 20th century: It had voted for the winner of every presidential election since 1900, except for 1956 (when the state narrowly favored [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] over [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]). Missouri's bellwether status was due to the fact that it not only voted for the electoral victor, but that its returns usually mirrored national returns.\n\nThe state itself is a geographically central state, bordered by both the edges of Southern and [[Midwestern]] regions. In statewide contests for much of the 20th century, Missouri favored the Democratic Party. In recent elections, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) has emerged in statewide contests. The election of 2004 was an important one; as [[George W. Bush]] was re-elected he carried Missouri. But this time his margin in the state was greater than it was nationwide. Bush won the [[Presidency]] 51% to 48%, he carried Missouri 53% to 46%. This trend had begun in 2000, when Bush lost the national popular vote to [[Al Gore]] 47% to 48% but still won Missouri, 50% to 47%. Bush's victory also saw Republicans triumph in several statewide contests; Senator [[Kit Bond]] was re-elected by a decisive 56% to 43% margin and [[Matt Blunt]] won the election for Governor, narrowly defeating state auditor [[Claire McCaskill]] 51% to 48%. The GOP also captured control of the state legislature for the first time in eighty years.\n\nTalent, anticipating a tough re-election battle and attempting to dissuade challengers, had accumulated a large campaign fund.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=MO&Year=2006 | website = OpenSecrets.org | title = Missouri Congressional Races in 2006 | publisher = Center for Responsive Politics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110003801/http://www.opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=MO&Year=2006 |archive-date=January 10, 2007 |access-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref> For most of 2005, he had no opposition. State Senator [[Chuck Graham]] had briefly entered the race early in the year, but dropped out soon after. However, on August 30, 2005, Democrat Claire McCaskill announced her intention to run for Talent's Senate seat.\n\nMcCaskill started with a large financial disadvantage, but she was also an experienced candidate with high name recognition. McCaskill had run two successful campaigns for state auditor. She was also a candidate for governor in 2004, when she defeated the incumbent Democratic Governor [[Bob Holden]] in the [[primary election]] but lost with 48% of the vote in the general election.\n\nBoth Talent and McCaskill faced unknowns in their respective primaries on August 8, 2006, and defeated them soundly.\n\nThe Missouri contest was seen as vitally important to control of the [[United States Senate]]; as a toss-up election between two strong candidates, the race was expected to attract a lot of interest as well as money spent on ads and turning out supporters. If Talent won, then a Democratic takeover of the U.S. Senate depended upon victories in [[2006 Tennessee United States Senate election|Tennessee]], where the Republican Bob Corker won, and [[2006 Virginia United States Senate election|Virginia]], where Democrat Jim Webb won; the Democrats needed to win six seats to take control of the chamber with 51 seats. To do this, they would need to retain their 19 incumbent seats, win the four Republican-held seats of [[2006 Montana United States Senate election|Montana]], [[2006 Ohio United States Senate election|Ohio]], [[2006 Rhode Island United States Senate election|Rhode Island]], and [[2006 Pennsylvania United States Senate election|Pennsylvania]] (where Democratic chances seemed above 50%, and Democrats won all 4.) and two of the following three \"toss-up\" races: Missouri, [[2006 Tennessee United States Senate election|Tennessee]] and [[2006 Virginia United States Senate election|Virginia]].\n\nIt is believed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that statewide ballot issues drove the November 2006 vote. Talent was on the opposite of the majority of voters in this poll on just about every issue: 66% of Missouri voters favored raising the [[minimum wage]] to $6.50 an hour; 62% of Missouri voters favored raising taxes to replace [[Medicaid]] funding cut by the current Republican Governor, [[Matt Blunt]]; 54% opposed a law that would require all Missourians to show a photo ID before they vote; 58% favored campaign donation limitations; and 66% favored restoring Medicaid coverage to about 90,000 Missourians who lost coverage when Blunt and the Republican legislature tightened eligibility requirements.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, 62% favored a ballot proposal that would allow all types of embryonic stem cell research allowed under federal law - a measure Talent had recently announced that he was against.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/8CD39743858142E086257197005F0EAB?OpenDocument |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060808190341/http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/stories.nsf/stlouiscitycounty/story/8CD39743858142E086257197005F0EAB?OpenDocument |archive-date=August 8, 2006 | title = Senate race tied to state issues | first = Jo | last = Mannies | date = June 24, 2006 | newspaper = St. Louis Post-Dispatch}}</ref>\n\nOn election night the race was, as expected, too close to call. With 85% of the vote in and with still no call, McCaskill claimed victory. At the time McCaskill declared victory, she was ahead by a vote margin of 867,683 to Talent's 842,251 votes; in percentage terms, with 85% of the vote in, McCaskill led Talent, 49% to 48%. Finally, at 11:38 P.M. Central Time the [[Associated Press]] called McCaskill as the winner. [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], adjacent to [[St. Louis]], and [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], home of [[Kansas City]], are probably what pushed McCaskill over the finish line.\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Missouri general election\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Claire McCaskill]]\n | votes      = 1,055,255\n | percentage = 49.6%\n | change     = +0.9%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Jim Talent]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 1,006,941\n | percentage = 47.3%\n | change     = -2.5%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Frank Gilmour]]\n | votes      = 47,792\n | percentage = 2.2%\n | change     = +1.2%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Progressive Party (Missouri)\n | candidate  = [[Lydia Lewis]]\n | votes      = 18,383\n | percentage = 0.9%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  =\n | votes      = 88\n | percentage = 0.0%\n | change     = ''n/a''\n}}\n{{Election box plurality\n | votes      = 48,314\n | percentage = 2.3%\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 2,128,459\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link\n | winner     = Democratic Party (US)\n | loser      = Republican Party (US)\n | swing      =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Montana ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Montana election\n| country           = Montana\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Montana\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Montana\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Jon Tester, official 110th Congress photo.jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Jon Tester]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''199,845'''\n| percentage1       = '''49.16%'''\n| image2            = Conrad Burns official portrait.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Conrad Burns]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 196,283\n| percentage2       = 48.29%\n| map_image         = MTSen06County.png\n| map_size          = 200px\n| map_caption       = County results\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Conrad Burns]]\n| before_party      = Republican Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Jon Tester]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Montana}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Montana}}\nIncumbent Republican [[Conrad Burns]] was running for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Democrat [[Jon Tester]], [[President of the Senate|President]] of the [[Montana State Senate]], by a margin of 0.87%, or 3,562 votes out of 406,505 votes.\n\nBurns was first elected as a United States senator from Montana in 1988, when he defeated Democratic incumbent [[John Melcher]] in a close race, 51% to 48%.

In early 2006, the [[Club for Growth]], a pro-tax cut [[political action committee]], sent a series of mailings to Rhode Island Republicans attacking Chafee's positions and voting record.\n\nThe national GOP supported Chafee in the primary campaign, believing that he was the most likely candidate to hold the seat in the general election. [[Mitch McConnell|Senator Mitch McConnell]] of [[Kentucky]], [[John McCain]] of [[Arizona]] and [[Laura Bush]] appeared at fundraisers for Chafee, while [[Bill Frist|Senator Bill Frist's]] [[political action committee|PAC]] donated to Chafee. The [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] also ran ads in the state supporting Chafee. Steve Laffey, however, picked up many endorsements from Republican town committees throughout Rhode Island, the national group [[Club for Growth]], and former candidate for the party's Presidential nomination [[Steve Forbes]]. On July 10, 2006, the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]] filed a complaint with the [[Federal Election Commission]] against Laffey, saying that he had included a political communication in tax bills mailed to [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] of Cranston.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gopsenators.com/nrscwebimages/Laffey-CityofCranston-FECComplaint.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060921212031/http://www.gopsenators.com/nrscwebimages/Laffey-CityofCranston-FECComplaint.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = September 21, 2006 | title = NRSC | publisher = Gopsenators.com | accessdate = November 3, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin no change\n | title      = Republican primary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.state.ri.us/elections/results/2006/primary/statesummary.php|title=Rhode Island Board of Elections: Elections & Voting|website=elections.state.ri.us|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Lincoln Chafee (Incumbent)\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | votes      = 34,936\n | percentage = 54%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link no change\n | candidate  = Steve Laffey\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | votes      = 29,547\n | percentage = 46%\n}}\n{{Election box total no change\n | votes      = 64,483\n | percentage = 100.00%\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nDemocrats believed that this was one of the most likely Senate seats to switch party control, due to the Democratic tilt of Rhode Island, as well as the fact that Chafee needed to expend part of his campaign fund to win the Republican primary election. Chafee's approval ratings also took a beating from his primary battle with Laffey and may have hurt him in the general election. Another factor that hurt Chafee was the fact that Whitehouse, the Democratic nominee, had a huge head start on him, as he was able to campaign with little opposition for at least half the year and had not had to contend with a major opponent until the general election campaign. Rhode Islanders' historically large disapproval ratings for President Bush and the Republican Party as a whole was another major hurdle for Chafee.\n\nWhitehouse and Chafee very rarely disagreed on political issues. Socially, they agreed almost 100% of the time. Chafee was against the [[Bush tax cuts]], indicating his ideology was [[Liberalism|liberal]]-leaning. On some fiscal issues they disagreed on such as on social security and free trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.issues2000.org/Senate/Sheldon_Whitehouse.htm|title=Sheldon Whitehouse on the Issues|first=|last=OnTheIssues.org|website=issues2000.org|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Lincoln_Chafee.htm | title = Lincoln Chafee on the Issues | publisher = Ontheissues.org | accessdate = November 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{Election box begin\n | title      = Rhode Island general election<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/2006/2006Stat.htm#39|title=2006 Election Statistics|website=clerk.house.gov|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Sheldon Whitehouse]]\n | votes      = 206,043\n | percentage = 53.52%\n | change     = +12.37%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (US)\n | candidate  = [[Lincoln Chafee]] (Incumbent)\n | votes      = 178,950\n | percentage = 46.48%\n | change     = -10.40%\n}}\n{{Election box majority\n | votes      = 27,093\n | percentage = 7.04%\n | change     = -8.69%\n}}\n{{Election box turnout\n | votes      = 384,993\n | percentage =\n | change     =\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link\n | winner     = Democratic Party (US)\n | loser      = Republican Party (US)\n | swing      =\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nWhitehouse carried Providence County, which contains approximately 60% of the state's population, with 59% to Chafee's 41%.

That was likely because:\n* Even in large jurisdictions, recounts \u2014 such as those in [[2000 United States presidential election in Florida|Florida in 2000]] and [[2004 Washington gubernatorial election|Washington's 2004 gubernatorial election]] \u2014 rarely result in a swing of more than 1,000 votes, and Allen was trailing by almost 10,000 in the initial count. In particular, almost all votes in this Virginia election were cast using electronic voting machines, whose results are unlikely to change in a recount.\n* There was wide speculation that calling for a recount (and still losing) would give Allen a \"sore loser\" label, which would hurt his future election campaigns, including what some speculated might still involve a [[Official and Potential 2008 United States presidential election Republican candidates|2008 presidential run]]. However, after losing the senatorial election, on December 10, 2006, Allen announced that he would not be running for president in 2008.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Washington ==\n{{Infobox election\n| election_name     = Washington election\n| country           = Washington\n| type              = presidential\n| ongoing           = no\n| previous_election = 2000 United States Senate election in Washington\n| previous_year     = 2000\n| next_election     = 2012 United States Senate election in Washington\n| next_year         = 2012\n| election_date     = <!--Don't need election date in section infoboxes when the date is the same as in the article's main infobox.-->\n| image_size        = 125x136px\n| image1            = Maria Cantwell, official portrait, 110th Congress (cropped).jpg\n| nominee1          = '''[[Maria Cantwell]]'''\n| party1            = Democratic Party (US)\n| popular_vote1     = '''1,184,659'''\n| percentage1       = '''56.9%'''\n| image2            = Mike McGavick.jpg\n| nominee2          = [[Mike McGavick]]\n| party2            = Republican Party (US)\n| popular_vote2     = 832,106\n| percentage2       = 39.9%\n| map_image         = File:Washington Senate Election Results by County 2006.svg|thumb|Washington senate election 2006\n| map_size          = 250px\n| map_caption       = County results\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\nCantwell\n{{legend|#b9d7ff|40-50%}}\n{{legend|#86b6f2|50-60%}}\n{{legend|#4389e3|60-70%}}\n{{col-2}}\nMcGavick\n{{legend|#f2b3be|40-50%}}\n{{legend|#e27f90|50-60%}}\n{{legend|#cc2f4a|60-70%}}\n{{col-end}}\n| title             = U.S. Senator\n| before_election   = [[Maria Cantwell]]\n| before_party      = Democratic Party (US)\n| after_election    = [[Maria Cantwell]]\n| after_party       = Democratic Party (US)\n}}\n{{Main|2006 United States Senate election in Washington}}\n{{See also|List of United States senators from Washington}}\nIncumbent Democrat [[Maria Cantwell]] won re-election to a second term.\n\nThe filing deadline was July 28, 2006, with the primary held September 19, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.politics1.com/wa.htm | title = Washington | author = Ron Gunzburger | date = March 8, 2005 | website = Politics1.com | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060316213129/http://www.politics1.com/wa.htm | archivedate = March 16, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> Cantwell consistently led in polling throughout the race, although political analysts saw her as vulnerable this election cycle due to her extremely narrow win in 2000 and discontent among progressive voters.

The governor, lieutenant governor, treasurer, state auditor, and insurance commissioner are Democrats, while only secretary of state, attorney general, and commissioner of public lands are Republican. Of the nine representatives Washington sends to the House of Representatives, six are Democrats. Democrat [[Patty Murray]] is the state's senior senator. Cantwell won her initial election to the Senate in 2000 over [[Slade Gorton]] by 2,229 votes. Due to the closeness of that race, and the close gubernatorial contest between Democrat [[Christine Gregoire]] and Republican [[Dino Rossi]] in November 2004, many Republicans believed they had a strong chance of capturing Cantwell's seat in 2006.\n\nOn March 9, 2006, [[Aaron Dixon]] announced his decision to seek the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party's]] nomination for U.S. Senate, challenging Cantwell on her continued support for the [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003\u2013present|U.S. presence in Iraq]] and the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. On May 13, 2006, Mr. Dixon secured the party's nomination at the Green Party of Washington state's Spring Convention.\n\nInitially, Cantwell had two challengers from within the Democratic primary, both of them taking strong stances against the Iraq war that brought attention to Cantwell's votes for the Iraq Resolution and against a timeline for withdrawal. Three other Democrats also entered the primary race.\n\nOn August 8, 2006, the incumbent Democratic Senator from Connecticut, [[Joe Lieberman]], lost his primary race to challenger [[Ned Lamont]] by 52%-48%, and appears to be following through on his earlier commitment to run as an Independent in the general election. A great deal of attention has focused on this race, as an early barometer of both anti-incumbent and anti-war sentiment nationwide. Comparisons have been made between Lieberman's troubles and Cantwell's re-election bid, citing Cantwell's vote in favor of the [[Iraq Resolution]] that led to the war, her refusal to say she regretted the vote, and her vote against a timetable for withdrawal.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lieberman Explains His Stance on Iraq|author1= Patrick Healy|author2= Jennifer Medina | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/nyregion/07campaign.html?_r=1&ref=washington&oref=slogin | newspaper = The New York Times | date = August 7, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Nutmeg State Democrats Choose Lamont | author = SethGitell | url = http://www.nysun.com/article/37604?page_no=1 | newspaper = The New York Sun | date = August 9, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnlike Lamont's campaign, Cantwell's anti-war opponents' campaigns have received much less funding and have not had the same support from the blogosphere that brought Lamont to prominence and improved his name recognition. Also, unlike Lieberman, Cantwell has altered her position on the war during her campaign and criticized the Bush Administration for its conduct of the war. She also hired her most vocal anti-war primary opponent, Mark Wilson, at $8,000-a-month salary, a move that was described by political commentators as \"buying out\" the opposition (which she also allegedly attempted with other anti-war challengers Hong Tran and Aaron Dixon).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://soundpolitics.com/archives/006979.html | title = Did Senator Cantwell try to co-opt another opponent?|last1= Earling|first1= Eric | date = September 25, 2006 | website = Sound Politics | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> The article does, however, note that, despite the differences in exact circumstances, the Lieberman defeat also shows that voters are in an anti-incumbent mood, which could create problems for Cantwell.<ref>{{cite news | title = Anti-war liberals blast Cantwell | author = Neil Modie | url = http://seattlepi.com/local/280737_cantwell10.html | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = August 9, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> This is supported by another P-I article that also notes that the primary loss of Lieberman and two [[United States House of Representatives|House]] incumbents, Michigan Republican [[Joe Schwarz]] and Georgia Democrat [[Cynthia McKinney]], on the same day indicates that there may be a nationwide anti-incumbent trend.<ref>[http://seattlepi.com/national/1130AP_Incumbents_Beware.html]{{dead link | date = September 2013}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the primary results, Cantwell endorsed Ned Lamont and McGavick responded by endorsing Senator Lieberman.{{citation needed | date=November 2017}} The Dixon campaign released a statement criticizing Cantwell's \"spin and vague rhetoric\" on the war, and equating her current position to a pro-war stance similar to Lieberman's.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gp.org/press/states/wa_2006_08_16.shtml | title=Cantwell Can't Hide Her Pro-War Record With Spin and Vague Rhetoric, Says Dixon | publisher=Green Party of the United States | date=August 11, 2006 | accessdate=September 19, 2013 | archive-date=September 19, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919015907/http://www.gp.org//press/states/wa_2006_08_16.shtml | author=Green Party of the United States | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all | work=gp.org/}}</ref>\n\nOn August 14, less than a week after Lamont's win and nearly four years after the actual event, Cantwell for the first time said she would have voted against the authorization to use force in Iraq if she knew then what she knows today.<ref name=\"frist\">{{cite news | title = Frist backs McGavick but not all his views | author = David Postman | url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003199347_frist15m.html | newspaper = The Seattle Times | date = August 15, 2006 | accessdate = September 19, 2013}}</ref> However, she did so only after hearing her opponent McGavick say that he would have voted against the authorization under those conditions.<ref name=\"fryer\">{{cite news | title = Should we leave Iraq?

In 2000, then Republican Governor [[George W. Bush]] of [[Texas]] won West Virginia's five [[United States Electoral College|electoral college votes]] over then [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] of [[Tennessee]] by a margin of 52-46. Also in the 2000 election, Republican [[Shelley Moore Capito]], the daughter of Former [[List of Governors of West Virginia|West Virginia Governor]] [[Arch A. Moore, Jr.]], won a surprise victory over Democrat [[Jim Humphreys (West Virginia politician)|Jim Humphreys]] for [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district|West Virginia's 2nd Congressional District seat]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. She would become the first Republican in West Virginia to hold a [[United States Congressional Delegations from West Virginia|Congressional office]] for more than one term since her father in 1969. Before these two major victories for national and West Virginia Republicans, it was difficult to find a Republican who could mount a formidable campaign against Democrats running for public office in West Virginia.\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] Bush won West Virginia again in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] over [[John Kerry|John F. Kerry]], the Democratic [[Junior senator|junior]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[United States Congressional Delegations from Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] by a margin of 56-43. Both [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Alan Mollohan]] (D-[[West Virginia's 1st congressional district|1st District]]) and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Nick Rahall]] (D-[[West Virginia's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]]) had more formidable challenges from Republicans when compared to 2000 and 2002. Republican [[Brent Benjamin]] defeated Democratic incumbent [[West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] Justice [[Warren McGraw]], and Republican [[Betty Ireland]] defeated liberal-Democrat [[Ken Hechler]], a former congressman and secretary of state, for [[West Virginia Secretary of State]].\n\nSince 2000, the Republicans have gained seven net seats in both the [[West Virginia Senate]] and the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]]. However, the Democrats hold 60% of the seats in the Senate and 68% of the seats in the House.\n\nAlong with continued majorities in the legislature, Democrats have also had some other victories. Even though both Bush and Capito won their respective offices in 2000, Senator Byrd sailed to an eighth term with 78% of the vote over Republican [[David Gallaher (politician)|David Gallaher]]. Senator [[Jay Rockefeller|John D. Rockefeller, IV]], easily won a fourth term to the Senate in [[2002 United States Senate elections|2002]] by a margin of 63-37 over Republican [[Jay Wolfe]]. In 2000, 2002, and 2004, both Representative Mollohan and Representative Rahall were re-elected by much stronger margins than Capito. In 2004, Republican [[Monty Warner]] failed to defeat Democratic [[West Virginia Secretary of State]] [[Joe Manchin]] for governor.\n\nAfter the Republicans failed to win the governor's race, West Virginia Republican Committee Chairman [[Kris Warner]], the brother of Monty, was put under pressure to resign his post; he did so in May 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=2679|title=Warner to Quit as GOP Chairman - WOWK-TV - WOWKTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051001030122/http://wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=2679|archive-date=October 1, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wheeling attorney [[Rob Capehart]] took his place.

On October 27, 2005, however, Ireland announced she would not run against the eight-term senator. She said that the office of Secretary of State should not be used as a political stepping stone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=6227|title=Secretary of State Betty Ireland Won't Challenge Byrd - WOWK-TV - WOWKTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=December 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513110722/http://www.wowktv.com/story.cfm?func=viewstory&storyid=6227|archive-date=May 13, 2006|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Ironically, [[Joe Manchin]] held the office of Secretary of State during his campaign for governor.\n\nConservative columnist [[Robert Novak]] wrote in a September 24, 2005, article<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/robertnovak/2005/09/24/155691.html|title=Robert Novak Articles - Political Columnist & Commentator - Robert Novak|website=Townhall|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}</ref> that [[Gale Catlett]]'s, the former Head Coach of the [[West Virginia University]] Men's Basketball team, name had been floated around as a possible challenger to Byrd.
