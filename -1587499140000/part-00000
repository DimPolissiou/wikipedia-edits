The statement pointed out that Ayyadurai's approach instead \"focused on communications between linked computer terminals in an ordinary office situation\".<ref name=\"SmithsonianStatement\"/> ''The Washington Post'' also followed up with a correction of errors in its earlier report on the Smithsonian acquisition, stating that it incorrectly referred to Ayyadurai as the inventor of electronic messaging; the 'bcc', 'cc', 'to' and 'from' fields existed previously; Ayyadurai had not been honored as the \"inventor of email\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost\"/>\n\nWriting for ''[[Gizmodo]]'', [[Sam Biddle]] argued that email was developed a decade before EMAIL, beginning with [[Ray Tomlinson]]'s sending the first text letter between two [[ARPANET]]-connected computers in 1971.<ref>i.e. the first ''network'' email using the \"@\" syntax; email between users on the same mainframe was already common.</ref> Biddle quoted Tomlinson: \"[We] had most of the headers needed to deliver the message (to:, cc:, etc.) as well as identifying the sender (from:) and when the message was sent (date:) and what the message was about.\" Biddle allowed for the possibility that Ayyadurai may have coined the term \"EMAIL\" and used the header terms without being aware of earlier work, but maintained that the historical record isn't definitive on either point. Biddle wrote that \"laying claim to the name of a product that's the generic term for a universal technology gives you acres of weasel room.

He said that CSIR scientists reported that \"they work in a [[medieval]], [[feudalism|feudal]] environment\" that required a \"major overhaul\". The letter was co-authored by a colleague, Deepak Sardana. [[Pushpa Mittra Bhargava|Pushpa Bhargava]], founding director of the CSIR's Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, endorsed the letter, calling Ayyadurai's sacking the worst of many cases he had seen of \"vindictiveness in the CSIR\" and accused CSIR administration of being \"impervious to healthy and fair criticism\".

Its plot focuses on a girl at a remote [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[boarding school]] who discovers she has psychic powers that allow her to communicate with insects and uses them to pursue a [[serial killer]] who is butchering young women at and around the school.\n\nAfter its release in Italy, ''Phenomena'' was purchased for distribution in the United States by [[New Line Cinema]], who cut over twenty minutes and released it under the title ''Creepers''.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter missing a bus in the Swiss countryside, a tourist, Vera Brandt, tries looking for help. She comes across a home and, upon entering, she is attacked by a stranger, who proceeds to chase and behead her. \n\nEight months later, Jennifer Corvino arrives at the Swiss [[Richard Wagner]] Academy for Girls, chaperoned by Frau Br\u00fcckner, who places her with roommate Sophie. While sleepwalking through the academy and out onto the roof, Jennifer witnesses a student being murdered. She awakens and falls, fleeing and eventually becoming lost in the woods. Forensic [[entomologist]] John McGregor's chimpanzee, Inga, finds her and leads her to him. Witnessing her apparent interaction with his insects, McGregor comes to believe she has a special gift for [[telepathy]] with them. Inspector Rudolf Geiger is on the case alongside McGregor. Back at the academy, the headmistress has Jennifer medically tested via [[EEG]] for her sleepwalking. The procedure makes Jennifer uneasy when she gets brief visions of the previous night's events, and so she leaves. Jennifer then asks Sophie to look out for her in case she sleepwalks again. \n\nFollowing a tryst the same night, Sophie is murdered. Jennifer sleepwalks again. When she goes outside, a firefly leads her to a maggot-infested glove. The next day, she shows it to McGregor, who identifies the maggots as [[Flesh fly|Great Sarcophagus flies]], which are drawn to decaying human flesh. He theorises that the larvae's presence on the glove indicates that the killer has been keeping his victims close to him post-mortem, unintentionally collecting the larvae on himself whilst physically interacting with the victims. This indicates that they are dealing with a psychopath.\n\nLater at the academy, when the other students taunt Jennifer for her connection to insects, she summons a swarm of flies that covers the entire building, then faints. Convinced that Jennifer is \"diabolic\" and possibly responsible for the killings, the headmistress arranges for her to be transferred to a mental hospital for the criminally insane. However, Jennifer flees to McGregor's home in time to evade the transfer.\n\nMcGregor gives Jennifer a glass case with a Great Sarcophagus fly and suggests she use it to track the murderer. When the fly leads her to the same house that Vera had found earlier, Jennifer is told to leave when the real estate agent catches her, assuming her to be a thief. Geiger arrives and gets some information from the agent before leaving.\n\nLater that night, McGregor is murdered in his home after Inga is distracted and locked outside. With nowhere left to go, Jennifer calls her father's lawyer Morris Shapiro for help. He alerts Br\u00fcckner, who finds Jennifer and offers to let the girl stay at her house overnight. Once there, Br\u00fcckner insists that Jennifer take some pills before she goes to bed; when Jennifer does so, she becomes sick and assuming that the pills were poisonous, coughs them up. After leaving the bathroom, she attempts to call Morris but is knocked unconscious with a piece of wood by Br\u00fcckner, who incarcerates her in the house. Geiger arrives at the house and is attacked by Br\u00fcckner.\n\nAfter coming-to a brief time later, Jennifer engineers her escape through a large hole in the floor that leads through a tunnel to a dungeon and into a basement. There, she falls in a pool infested with maggots and dead bodies. Geiger is in the room, above Jennifer, struggling to free himself from chains attached to his wrists. Br\u00fcckner appears and taunts Jennifer, but Geiger frees himself from the chains and holds Br\u00fcckner just long enough to let Jennifer escape.\n\nFollowing her escape from the pool, she passes a room from which she hears sobbing. There she finds Br\u00fcckner's son, who has a hideously deformed face; the result of a rape. He chases Jennifer onto a motorboat and tries to kill her, but she summons a swarm of flies that attack him, causing him to fall into the water. Jennifer is forced to jump into the water as the motorboat explodes, whereupon the child grabs her. Rising into the flaming waters, he is eventually killed. Jennifer reaches the shore just as Morris appears. A severely disfigured Br\u00fcckner reappears and decapitates him from behind as Jennifer screams in horror. She then leans over Jennifer threatening her with the same fate before madly confessing that she murdered McGregor and Geiger out of fear that harm would have befallen her and her son. Suddenly, a wrathful Inga attacks Br\u00fcckner and brutally kills her with a straight-razor. \n\nWith the ordeal over, Jennifer and Inga embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Jennifer Corvino\n* [[Daria Nicolodi]] as Frau Br\u00fcckner\n* [[Dalila Di Lazzaro]] as Headmistress\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Inspector Rudolf Geiger\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Professor John McGregor\n* [[Fiore Argento]] as Vera Brandt\n* Federica Mastroianni as Sophie\n* [[Kaspar Capparoni|Gaspare Capparoni]] as Karl\n* Fiorenza Tessari as Gisela Sulzer\n* Mario Donatone as Morris Shapiro\n* Francesca Ottaviani as Nurse\n* [[Michele Soavi]] as Kurt, Geiger's assistant\n* Franco Trevisi as Real Estate Agent\n* Davide Marotta as Frau Br\u00fcckner's son\n\n==Release==\n''Phenomena'' was released theatrically in Italy on 31 January 1985 with a 116-minute running time.<ref name=\"arrow-55\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Dario Argento's Phenomena|chapter=About the Versions|year=2017|page=55|type=book|publisher=[[Arrow Films|Arrow Video]]|ID=FCD1507}}</ref> This version of ''Phenomena'' is often referred to as the \"integral cut\".<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> A shorter version of the film was prepared for international release that had a 110-minute running time.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> This version of the film only cuts out minor material from the \"integral cut\" with most being a few frames at the end and beginning of shots.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> When the film was released theatrically in the United States, it was re-titled ''Creepers'' and was cut to 83 minutes with scenes cut entirely and other scenes being re-ordered.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> ''Creepers'' also had music segue between scenes where previously they had no music and the loss of the song \"Locomotive\" by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]].<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> Troy Howarth, author of ''So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films'' described ''Creepers'' as being the last of Argento's films to receive \"any kind of meaningful theatrical release\" in the United States.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=122}} \n\n===Home media===\n''Creepers'' was released in the United States on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in 1986 by [[Media Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=New Releases|date=15 February 1986|volume=98|issue=7|ISSN=0006-2510|page=28}}</ref> This release still had the shorter theatrical run time.{{sfn|Stine|2003|p=228}} By March 29, ''Creepers'' entered ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Top Videocassettes Rentals chart.

When the fly leads her to the same house that Vera had found earlier, Jennifer is told to leave when the real estate agent catches her, assuming her to be a thief. Geiger arrives and gets some information from the agent before leaving.\n\nLater that night, McGregor is murdered in his home after Inga is distracted and locked outside. With nowhere left to go, Jennifer calls her father's lawyer Morris Shapiro for help. He alerts Br\u00fcckner, who finds Jennifer and offers to let the girl stay at her house overnight. Once there, Br\u00fcckner insists that Jennifer take some pills before she goes to bed; when Jennifer does so, she becomes sick and assuming that the pills were poisonous, coughs them up. After leaving the bathroom, she attempts to call Morris but is knocked unconscious with a piece of wood by Br\u00fcckner, who incarcerates her in the house. Geiger arrives at the house and is attacked by Br\u00fcckner.\n\nAfter coming-to a brief time later, Jennifer engineers her escape through a large hole in the floor that leads through a tunnel to a dungeon and into a basement. There, she falls in a pool infested with maggots and dead bodies. Geiger is in the room, above Jennifer, struggling to free himself from chains attached to his wrists. Br\u00fcckner appears and taunts Jennifer, but Geiger frees himself from the chains and holds Br\u00fcckner just long enough to let Jennifer escape.\n\nFollowing her escape from the pool, she passes a room from which she hears sobbing. There she finds Br\u00fcckner's son, who has a hideously deformed face; the result of a rape. He chases Jennifer onto a motorboat and tries to kill her, but she summons a swarm of flies that attack him, causing him to fall into the water. Jennifer is forced to jump into the water as the motorboat explodes, whereupon the child grabs her. Rising into the flaming waters, he is eventually killed. Jennifer reaches the shore just as Morris appears. A severely disfigured Br\u00fcckner reappears and decapitates him from behind as Jennifer screams in horror. She then leans over Jennifer threatening her with the same fate before madly confessing that she murdered McGregor and Geiger out of fear that harm would have befallen her and her son. Suddenly, a wrathful Inga attacks Br\u00fcckner and brutally kills her with a straight-razor. \n\nWith the ordeal over, Jennifer and Inga embrace.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Connelly]] as Jennifer Corvino\n* [[Daria Nicolodi]] as Frau Br\u00fcckner\n* [[Dalila Di Lazzaro]] as Headmistress\n* [[Patrick Bauchau]] as Inspector Rudolf Geiger\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as Professor John McGregor\n* [[Fiore Argento]] as Vera Brandt\n* Federica Mastroianni as Sophie\n* [[Kaspar Capparoni|Gaspare Capparoni]] as Karl\n* Fiorenza Tessari as Gisela Sulzer\n* Mario Donatone as Morris Shapiro\n* Francesca Ottaviani as Nurse\n* [[Michele Soavi]] as Kurt, Geiger's assistant\n* Franco Trevisi as Real Estate Agent\n* Davide Marotta as Frau Br\u00fcckner's son\n\n==Release==\n''Phenomena'' was released theatrically in Italy on 31 January 1985 with a 116-minute running time.<ref name=\"arrow-55\">{{Cite AV media notes|title=Dario Argento's Phenomena|chapter=About the Versions|year=2017|page=55|type=book|publisher=[[Arrow Films|Arrow Video]]|ID=FCD1507}}</ref> This version of ''Phenomena'' is often referred to as the \"integral cut\".<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> A shorter version of the film was prepared for international release that had a 110-minute running time.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> This version of the film only cuts out minor material from the \"integral cut\" with most being a few frames at the end and beginning of shots.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> When the film was released theatrically in the United States, it was re-titled ''Creepers'' and was cut to 83 minutes with scenes cut entirely and other scenes being re-ordered.<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> ''Creepers'' also had music segue between scenes where previously they had no music and the loss of the song \"Locomotive\" by [[Mot\u00f6rhead]].<ref name=\"arrow-55\" /> Troy Howarth, author of ''So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films'' described ''Creepers'' as being the last of Argento's films to receive \"any kind of meaningful theatrical release\" in the United States.{{sfn|Howarth|2015|p=122}} \n\n===Home media===\n''Creepers'' was released in the United States on [[VHS]] and [[Betamax]] in 1986 by [[Media Home Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|title=New Releases|date=15 February 1986|volume=98|issue=7|ISSN=0006-2510|page=28}}</ref> This release still had the shorter theatrical run time.{{sfn|Stine|2003|p=228}} By March 29, ''Creepers'' entered ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Top Videocassettes Rentals chart.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club.

Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992\u201393.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39\u201348</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994\u201395.]]\nThe club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993\u201398)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club.

Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club.

He also ran in the [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962 election]] in the riding of [[Spadina (electoral district)|Spadina]] losing to Liberal candidate [[Perry Ryan (Canadian politician)|Perry Ryan]] by less than 2,000 votes.\n\n==Publishing and broadcasting==\nHe became a [[reporter]] for [[Toronto]]'s ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' newspaper after graduating from university. After World War II, he was hired by the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' as advertising director.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.ryerson.ca/m3694/ |title=An Officer and a Journalist |work=Ryerson Review of Journalism |publisher=The Ryerson School of Journalism |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305001307/http://www.journalism.ryerson.ca/m3694/ |archivedate=2016-03-05 }}</ref> His first experience in newspaper ownership was with the ''[[Sherbrooke Daily Record]]'', which he bought from his father. In 1952, Bassett purchased part ownership of the ''Toronto Telegram''. In 1960, he founded [[Telegram Corporation|Baton Broadcasting]] to run [[Toronto]]'s first commercial [[television station]], [[CFTO-TV]].  A few months later, he won the television rights to the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Eastern Conference of the Canadian Football League]].  He needed a network in order to broadcast the games.  The result was the Canadian Television Network, later to become [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], with CFTO as the flagship station.  Starting in the 1980s, Bassett began a drive to take over CTV by buying as many stations as possible.  He succeeded in 1997, a year before his death.\n\n==Sports==\nFrom 1957 to 1974, Bassett was the owner of the [[Toronto Argonauts]], a team in the [[Canadian Football League]].\n\nIn 1957, he was named to the \"Silver Seven,\" a committee that oversaw hockey operations for the  [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. In 1961, longtime Maple Leafs owner [[Conn Smythe]] sold most of his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. (which owned the Maple Leafs and [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]) to a partnership of his son [[Stafford Smythe|Stafford]], [[Toronto Marlboros]] president [[Harold Ballard]] and Bassett for $2.3 million.  Conn later claimed that he thought he was selling only to his son, but it is very unlikely that Stafford would have been able to raise the money on his own. Bassett became chairman of the Gardens' board of directors, when Smythe resigned shortly after Toronto won the Stanley Cup in 1962. Bassett's name appears on the Stanley Cup 4 times 1962, 1963, 1964, 1967.\n\nIn 1969, Ballard and Stafford Smythe were charged with tax evasion and accused of using Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. to pay for their personal expenses. Bassett persuaded the board to fire Smythe as president and Ballard as executive vice president. The board elected Bassett as the new president.\n\nHowever, Bassett did not force Smythe and Ballard to sell their shares, and they both remained on the board. That was a serious strategic blunder on Bassett's part; Smythe was still the largest shareholder, and he and Ballard controlled almost half the shares between them. A year later, Ballard and Smythe staged a proxy war to win back control. Faced with an untenable situation, Bassett resigned and sold his shares to Smythe and Ballard.\n\nBassett's son, [[John F. Bassett]], would follow in his father's path of becoming a professional sports owner; the younger Bassett was a part owner of the [[World Hockey Association]]'s [[Ottawa Nationals]], [[Toronto Toros]] and [[Birmingham Bulls (WHA)|Birmingham Bulls]]; the [[World Football League]]'s [[Memphis Southmen]] and the [[United States Football League]]'s [[Tampa Bay Bandits]].\n\n==Government==\nIn 1989, he was appointed for a three-year term as chairman of the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]], an independent body that reports to the [[Parliament of Canada]] on the operations of the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]].

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>, but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.  [[Norman Donaldson]] wrote a full biography, ''In Search of Dr. Throndyke'', [[Bowling Green University]] Popular Press, Bowling Green, Ohio, 1971.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R. Austin Freeman, ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'', 1973, Dover (New York), {{ISBN|0-486-20388-3}}, from the introduction by E. F. Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'  Most of us agree with Chandler.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\" />\n\nIn ''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]] wrote: \"... [his] talents as a writer were negligible.

He claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] (a crime fiction in which the commission of the crime is described at the beginning, usually including the identity of the perpetrator, with the story then describing the detective's attempt to solve the mystery). Freeman used some of his early experiences as a colonial [[surgeon]] in his novels.\n\nMany of the [[Dr. Thorndyke]] stories involve genuine, but often quite arcane, points of scientific knowledge, from areas such as [[tropical medicine]], [[metallurgy]] and [[toxicology]].\n\n==Early life==\nAustin Freeman was the youngest of the five children of tailor Richard Freeman and Ann Maria Dunn.  He first trained as an [[apothecary]] and then studied [[medicine]] at [[Middlesex Hospital]] Medical College, qualifying in 1887.  He specialized in ear, nose, and throat.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>  He married Annie Elizabeth the same year, with whom he had two sons.  He was house physician for a short time<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>, then entered the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Service]] and was sent to [[Accra]] on the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as an assistant surgeon<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref>.\n\n<blockquote>At this time the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) was a group of semi-independent kingdoms, still unacculturated, subject to incursions by the European colonial powers who were eager to annex them.  The French had been attempting to buy the favor of the native kings, and a British expedition, including Freeman, set out to investigate.  It was mostly through Freeman's intelligence and tact that the expedition was not massacred, and his future seemed assured in the colonial service.<ref>Introduction to ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' by E. F. Bleiler, Dover edition</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnfortunately, he contracted [[blackwater fever]] and was sent home.<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThus, he returned to [[London]] in 1891, serving for a time as acting physician in [[Holloway Prison]]<ref>Author's biography, ''A Silent Witness'', House of Stratus, 2001</ref>, but was unable to find a permanent medical position, so decided to settle down in Gravesend and earn money from writing fiction, while continuing to practice medicine.  His first stories were written in collaboration with [[John James Pitcairn]] (1860\u20131936), medical officer at [[Holloway Prison]], and published under the ''[[nom de plume]]'' \"Clifford Ashdown\".  His first Thorndyke story, ''The Red Thumb Mark'', was published in 1907, and shortly afterwards he pioneered the [[inverted detective story]], in which the identity of the criminal is shown from the beginning.  Some short stories with this feature were collected in ''The Singing Bone'' in 1912.  During [[World War I|the First World War]] he served as a captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and afterwards produced a Thorndyke novel almost every year until his death in 1943. The house where he died, 94 Windmill Street in Gravesend, is now Thorndyke's Nursing Home.\n\nFreeman claimed to have invented the [[inverted detective story]] in his 1912 collection of short stories ''The Singing Bone''. \"Some years ago I devised, as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts.  The first part was a minute and detailed description of a crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant circumstances.  The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the criminal, and was in possession of all the facts.  It would have seemed that there was nothing left to tell, but I calculated that the reader would be so occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence.  And so it turned out.  The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to most readers the effect of new matter.\"<ref>This is a quote from an essay by Freeman entitled \"The Art of the Detective Story\", which is itself quoted in ''The Best Dr. Thorndyke Detective Stories'' (Dover, New York, 1973), in the introduction by E. F. Bleiler.</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nFreeman held conservative political views.<ref name=\"am\">{{cite book |first=Angus |last=McLaren |title=Reproduction by Design: Sex, Robots, Trees, and Test-Tube Babies in Interwar Britain |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2012 |isbn=0-226-56069-4 |pages=64\u20135}}</ref> In his 1921 book ''Social Decay and Regeneration'' Freeman put forth the view that [[mechanization]] had flooded Britain with poor-quality goods and created a \"homogenized, restless, unionized working class\".<ref name=\"am\"/> Freeman supported the [[eugenics]] movement and argued that people with \"undesirable\" biological traits should be prevented from breeding through \"segregation, marriage restriction, and\n[[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]]\".<ref>McLaren, 2012, (p. 71).</ref> The book also attacked the British [[Labour movement]] and criticised the British government for permitting immigrants (whom Freeman referred to as \"Sub-Man\") to settle in Britain.

For the first twenty-five years of his career, at least, he dominated the world of British detective fiction. ... Freeman was always in the forefront of the form. Today, with [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]], who is remembered for other reasons, he is one of the very few Edwardian detective story writers who are still read.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\">R.

Bleiler</ref>\n\n\"[[Raymond Chandler]], whose essay '[[The Simple Art of Murder]]' did much toward demolishing the classical detective story, had this to say in a letter to [[Hamish Hamilton]], the British publisher: 'This man Austin Freeman is a wonderful performer.  He has no equal in his genre, and he is also a much better writer than you might think, if you were superficially inclined, because in spite of the immense leisure of his writing, he accomplishes an even suspense which is quite unexpected ... There is even a gaslight charm about his Victorian love affairs, and those wonderful walks across London ...'  Most of us agree with Chandler.\"<ref name=\"Bleiler\" />\n\nIn ''Bloody Murder'', [[Julian Symons]] wrote: \"... [his] talents as a writer were negligible.

{"title_page": "Adjoint representation", "text_new": "{{Lie groups |Algebras}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''adjoint representation''' (or '''adjoint action''') of a [[Lie group]] ''G'' is a way of representing the elements of the group as [[linear map|linear transformations]] of the group's [[Lie algebra]], considered as a [[vector space]]. For example, if ''G'' is GL(''n'', ''k'') (the Lie group of [[invertible matrix|''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices]]) over a fixed field <math>k</math>, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends an invertible ''n''-by-''n'' matrix <math> g </math> to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of <math>k^n</math> defined by: <math> x \\mapsto g x g^{-1} </math>.\n\nFor any Lie group, this natural [[group representation|representation]] is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the [[Differential of a function|differential]] of) the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]. The adjoint representation can be defined for [[linear algebraic group]]s over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{see also|Representation theory|Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group}}\nLet ''G'' be a [[Lie group]], and let\n:<math>\\Psi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>\nbe the mapping {{math|''g'' \u21a6 \u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}},  \nwith Aut(''G'') the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' and {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>: ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}} given by the [[inner automorphism]] (conjugation)\n:<math>\\Psi_g(h)= ghg^{-1}~.</math>\nThis \u03a8 is a [[Lie_group#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|Lie group homomorphism]].\n\nFor each ''g'' in ''G'', define {{math|Ad<sub>''g''</sub>}} to be the [[tangent space|derivative]] of {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}} at the origin:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g = (d\\Psi_g)_e : T_eG \\rightarrow T_eG</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|d}} is the differential and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G</math> is the [[tangent space]] at the origin  {{mvar|e}} ({{mvar|e}} being the identity element of the group  {{mvar|G}}). Since <math>\\Psi_g</math> is a Lie group automorphism, Ad<sub>''g''</sub> is a Lie algebra automorphism; i.e., an invertible [[linear transformation]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> to itself that preserves the [[Lie algebra#Definitions|Lie bracket]]. Moreover, since <math>g \\mapsto \\Psi_g</math> is a group homomorphism, <math>g \\mapsto \\operatorname{Ad}_g</math> too is a group homomorphism.<ref>Indeed, by [[chain rule]], <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{gh} = d (\\Psi_{gh})_e = d (\\Psi_g \\circ \\Psi_h)_e = d (\\Psi_g)_e \\circ d (\\Psi_h)_e = \\operatorname{Ad}_g \\circ \\operatorname{Ad}_h.</math></ref> Hence, the map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}\\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g), \\, g \\mapsto \\mathrm{Ad}_g</math>\nis a [[group representation]] called the '''adjoint representation''' of ''G''.\n\nIf ''G'' is an [[Lie_group\u2013Lie_algebra_correspondence#Homomorphisms|immersed Lie subgroup]] of the general linear group <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> (called immersely linear Lie group), then the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> consists of matrices and the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is the matrix exponential <math>\\operatorname{exp}(X) = e^X</math> for matrices ''X'' with small operator norms. Thus, for ''g'' in ''G'' and small ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, taking the derivative of <math>\\Psi_g(\\operatorname{exp}(tX)) = ge^{t X}g^{-1}</math> at ''t'' = 0, one gets:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(X) = gX g^{-1}</math>\nwhere on the right we have the products of matrices. If <math>G \\subset \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> is a closed subgroup (that is, ''G'' is a matrix Lie group), then this formula is valid for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\nSuccinctly, an adjoint representation is an [[isotropy representation]] associated to the conjugation action of ''G'' around the identity element of ''G''.\n\n===Derivative of Ad===\nOne may always pass from a representation of a Lie group ''G'' to a [[representation of a Lie algebra|representation of its Lie algebra]] by taking the derivative at the identity.\n\nTaking the derivative of the adjoint map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad} : G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math>\nat the identity element gives the '''adjoint representation''' of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> of ''G'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{ad} : & \\, \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) \\\\\n& \\,x \\mapsto \\operatorname{ad}_x = d(\\operatorname{Ad})_e(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) = \\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{g}))</math> is the Lie algebra of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math> which may be identified with the [[differential algebra#Derivation on a Lie algebra|derivation algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. One can show that\n:<math>\\mathrm{ad}_x(y) = [x,y]\\,</math>\nfor all <math>x,y \\in \\mathfrak g</math>, where the right hand side is given (induced) by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]]. Indeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=page 41}}</ref> recall that, viewing <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on ''G'', the bracket on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given as:<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=Proposition 1.9.}}</ref> for left-invariant vector fields ''X'', ''Y'',\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(d \\varphi_{-t}(Y) - Y)</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi_t: G \\to G</math> denotes the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] generated by ''X''. As it turns out, <math>\\varphi_t(g) = g\\varphi_t(e)</math>, roughly because both sides satisfy the same ODE defining the flow. That is, <math>\\varphi_t = R_{\\varphi_t(e)}</math> where <math>R_h</math> denotes the right multiplication by <math>h \\in G</math>. On the other hand, since <math>\\Psi_g = R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g</math>, by [[chain rule]],\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = d (R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g)(Y) = d R_{g^{-1}} (d L_g(Y)) = d R_{g^{-1}}(Y)</math>\nas ''Y'' is left-invariant. Hence,\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\varphi_t(e)}(Y) - Y)</math>,\nwhich is what was needed to show.\n\nThus, <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x</math> coincides with the same one defined in [[#Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra]] below. Ad and ad are related through the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]: Specifically, Ad<sub>exp(''x'')</sub> = exp(ad<sub>''x''</sub>) for all ''x'' in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref> It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = gYg^{-1}</math> and thus with <math>g = e^{tX}</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{e^{tX}}(Y) = e^{tX} Y e^{-tX}</math>.\nTaking the derivative of this at <math>t = 0</math>, we have:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_X Y = XY - YX</math>.\nThe general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let <math>G'</math> be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of ''G''. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for ''G'' and that for ''G{{'}}'' coincide; hence, without loss of generality, ''G'' can be assumed to be ''G{{'}}''.\n\nThe upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature.  Thus, for example, a vector {{mvar|x}}    in the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> generates a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}    in the group  {{mvar|G}}.  Similarly, the adjoint map {{math|ad<sub>x</sub>y {{=}} [''x'',''y'']}} of vectors in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is homomorphic{{clarify|map is homomorphic??|date=December 2018}} to the [[Lie derivative]] {{math|L<sub>''X''</sub>''Y'' {{=}} [''X'',''Y'']}} of vector fields on the group  {{mvar|G}} considered as a [[manifold]].\n\nFurther see the [[derivative of the exponential map]].\n\n== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element {{mvar|x}} of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines the adjoint action of {{mvar|x}} on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the map \n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x :\\mathfrak{g}\\to \\mathfrak{g} \\qquad  \\text{with}   \\qquad \\operatorname{ad}_x (y) = [x,y]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|y}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. It is called the '''adjoint endomorphism''' or '''adjoint action'''. (<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x</math> is also often denoted as <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)</math>.) Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the [[linear map|linear mapping]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}:\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\operatorname{End}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}. Within End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:\n:<math>[T, S]= T \\circ S - S \\circ T</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the [[Jacobi identity]]\n:<math>[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0</math> \ntakes the form \n:<math>\\left([\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y]\\right)(z) = \\left(\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\\right)(z)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are arbitrary elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThis last identity says that <big>ad</big> is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, <big>ad</big> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] and is called the '''adjoint representation''' of the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional, then End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] of the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a module over itself.\n\nThe kernel of <big>ad</big> is the [[center (algebra)|center]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (rephrasing of the definition). On the other hand, for each element {{mvar|z}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ad<sub>''z''</sub> obeys the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' law]]:\n:<math>\\delta ([x,y]) = [\\delta(x),y] + [x, \\delta(y)]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad<sub>''z''</sub> is a [[Lie algebra extension#Derivations|derivation]] and the image of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> under ad is \na subalgebra of Der<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the space of all derivations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G'', <big>ad</big> is the differential of <big>Ad</big> at the identity element of ''G'' (see [[#Derivative of Ad]] above).\n\nThere is the following formula similar to the binomial formula: for scalars <math>\\alpha, \\beta</math> and Lie algebra elements <math>x, y, z</math>,\n:<math>(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha - \\beta)^n [y, z] = \\sum_{i = 0}^n \\binom{n}{i}[(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha)^i y, (\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\beta)^{n - i} z]</math>.\n\n== Structure constants ==\n\nThe explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the [[structure constants]] of the algebra.

For example, if ''G'' is GL(''n'', ''k'') (the Lie group of [[invertible matrix|''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices]]) over a fixed field <math>k</math>, then the adjoint representation is the group homomorphism that sends any ''n''-by-''n'' matrix <math> g </math> to an endomorphism of the vector space of all linear transformations of <math>k^n</math> defined by: <math> x \\mapsto g x g^{-1} </math>.\n\nFor any Lie group, this natural [[group representation|representation]] is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the [[Differential of a function|differential]] of) the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]. The adjoint representation can be defined for [[linear algebraic group]]s over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{see also|Representation theory|Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group}}\nLet ''G'' be a [[Lie group]], and let\n:<math>\\Psi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>\nbe the mapping {{math|''g'' \u21a6 \u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}},  \nwith Aut(''G'') the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' and {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>: ''G'' \u2192 ''G''}} given by the [[inner automorphism]] (conjugation)\n:<math>\\Psi_g(h)= ghg^{-1}~.</math>\nThis \u03a8 is a [[Lie_group#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|Lie group homomorphism]].\n\nFor each ''g'' in ''G'', define {{math|Ad<sub>''g''</sub>}} to be the [[tangent space|derivative]] of {{math|\u03a8<sub>''g''</sub>}} at the origin:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g = (d\\Psi_g)_e : T_eG \\rightarrow T_eG</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|d}} is the differential and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G</math> is the [[tangent space]] at the origin  {{mvar|e}} ({{mvar|e}} being the identity element of the group  {{mvar|G}}).

Indeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=page 41}}</ref> recall that, viewing <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on ''G'', the bracket on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given as:<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi\u2013Nomizu|loc=Proposition 1.9.}}</ref> for left-invariant vector fields ''X'', ''Y'',\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(d \\varphi_{-t}(Y) - Y)</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi_t: G \\to G</math> denotes the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] generated by ''X''.

Ad and ad are related through the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]: Specifically, Ad<sub>exp(''x'')</sub> = exp(ad<sub>''x''</sub>) for all ''x'' in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref> It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = gYg^{-1}</math> and thus with <math>g = e^{tX}</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{e^{tX}}(Y) = e^{tX} Y e^{-tX}</math>.\nTaking the derivative of this at <math>t = 0</math>, we have:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_X Y = XY - YX</math>.\nThe general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let <math>G'</math> be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of ''G''. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for ''G'' and that for ''G{{'}}'' coincide; hence, without loss of generality, ''G'' can be assumed to be ''G{{'}}''.\n\nThe upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature.  Thus, for example, a vector {{mvar|x}}    in the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> generates a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}    in the group  {{mvar|G}}.  Similarly, the adjoint map {{math|ad<sub>x</sub>y {{=}} [''x'',''y'']}} of vectors in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is homomorphic{{clarify|map is homomorphic??|date=December 2018}} to the [[Lie derivative]] {{math|L<sub>''X''</sub>''Y'' {{=}} [''X'',''Y'']}} of vector fields on the group  {{mvar|G}} considered as a [[manifold]].\n\nFurther see the [[derivative of the exponential map]].\n\n== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element {{mvar|x}} of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines the adjoint action of {{mvar|x}} on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the map \n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x :\\mathfrak{g}\\to \\mathfrak{g} \\qquad  \\text{with}   \\qquad \\operatorname{ad}_x (y) = [x,y]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|y}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. It is called the '''adjoint endomorphism''' or '''adjoint action'''. (<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x</math> is also often denoted as <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)</math>.) Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the [[linear map|linear mapping]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}:\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\operatorname{End}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}. Within End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:\n:<math>[T, S]= T \\circ S - S \\circ T</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the [[Jacobi identity]]\n:<math>[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0</math> \ntakes the form \n:<math>\\left([\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y]\\right)(z) = \\left(\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\\right)(z)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are arbitrary elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThis last identity says that <big>ad</big> is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, <big>ad</big> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] and is called the '''adjoint representation''' of the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional, then End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] of the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a module over itself.\n\nThe kernel of <big>ad</big> is the [[center (algebra)|center]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (rephrasing of the definition). On the other hand, for each element {{mvar|z}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ad<sub>''z''</sub> obeys the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' law]]:\n:<math>\\delta ([x,y]) = [\\delta(x),y] + [x, \\delta(y)]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad<sub>''z''</sub> is a [[Lie algebra extension#Derivations|derivation]] and the image of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> under ad is \na subalgebra of Der<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the space of all derivations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G'', <big>ad</big> is the differential of <big>Ad</big> at the identity element of ''G'' (see [[#Derivative of Ad]] above).\n\nThere is the following formula similar to the binomial formula: for scalars <math>\\alpha, \\beta</math> and Lie algebra elements <math>x, y, z</math>,\n:<math>(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha - \\beta)^n [y, z] = \\sum_{i = 0}^n \\binom{n}{i}[(\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\alpha)^i y, (\\operatorname{ad}_x - \\beta)^{n - i} z]</math>.\n\n== Structure constants ==\n\nThe explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the [[structure constants]] of the algebra.

By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we have\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}(G) \\cong G/Z_G(G_0).</math>\n\nGiven a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, by [[Lie's third theorem]], there is a connected Lie group <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> whose Lie algebra is the image of the adjoint representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (i.e., <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})) = \\operatorname{ad}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.) It is called the '''adjoint group''' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nNow, if <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the Lie algebra of a connected Lie group ''G'', then <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is the image of the adjoint representation of ''G'': <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\operatorname{Ad}(G)</math>.\n\n== Roots of a semisimple Lie group ==\nIf ''G'' is [[semisimple group|semisimple]], the non-zero [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] of the adjoint representation form a [[root system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.3</ref> (In general, one needs to pass to the complexification of the Lie algebra before proceeding.)  To see how this works, consider the case ''G'' = SL(''n'', '''R'''). We can take the group of diagonal matrices diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) as our [[maximal torus]] ''T''.  Conjugation by an element of ''T'' sends\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&a_{12}&\\cdots&a_{1n}\\\\\na_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\na_{n1}&a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\mapsto\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&t_1t_2^{-1}a_{12}&\\cdots&t_1t_n^{-1}a_{1n}\\\\\nt_2t_1^{-1}a_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&t_2t_n^{-1}a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\nt_nt_1^{-1}a_{n1}&t_nt_2^{-1}a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThus, ''T'' acts trivially on the diagonal part of the Lie algebra of ''G'' and with eigenvectors ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup> on the various off-diagonal entries.  The roots of ''G'' are the weights diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2192 ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>.  This accounts for the standard description of the root system of ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;SL<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') as the set of vectors of the form ''e<sub>i</sub>''\u2212''e<sub>j</sub>''.\n\n=== Example SL(2, R) ===\nWhen computing the root system for one of the simplest cases of Lie Groups, the group SL(2, '''R''') of two dimensional matrices with determinant 1 consists of the set of matrices of the form:\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' real and ''ad''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''bc''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA maximal compact connected abelian Lie subgroup, or maximal torus ''T'', is given by the subset of all matrices of the form\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\exp(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\exp(-\\theta) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith <math> t_1 t_2 = 1 </math>. The Lie algebra of the maximal torus is the Cartan subalgebra consisting of the matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\theta & 0\\\\\n0 & -\\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} = \n\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}-\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\theta(e_1-e_2).\n</math>\n\nIf we conjugate an element of SL(2, ''R'') by an element of the maximal torus we obtain\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1/t_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na t_1 & b t_1 \\\\\nc / t_1 & d / t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 / t_1 & 0\\\\\n0       & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na       & b t_1^2\\\\\nc t_1^{-2} & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nare then 'eigenvectors' of the conjugation operation with eigenvalues <math>1,1,t_1^2, t_1^{-2}</math>. The function \u039b which gives <math>t_1^2</math> is a multiplicative character, or homomorphism from the group's torus to the underlying field R. The function \u03bb giving \u03b8 is a weight of the Lie Algebra with weight space given by the span of the matrices.\n\nIt is satisfying to show the multiplicativity of the character and the linearity of the weight. It can further be proved that the differential of \u039b can be used to create a weight. It is also educational to consider the case of SL(3, '''R''').\n\n== Variants and analogues ==\nThe adjoint representation can also be defined for [[algebraic group]]s over any field.<!-- even for an elliptic curve? -->{{clarify|give a definition|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe '''co-adjoint representation''' is the [[contragredient representation]] of the adjoint representation.  [[Alexandre Kirillov]] observed that the [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of any vector in a co-adjoint representation is a [[symplectic manifold]].  According to the philosophy in [[representation theory]] known as the '''orbit method''' (see also the [[Kirillov character formula]]), the irreducible representations of a Lie group ''G'' should be indexed in some way by its co-adjoint orbits. This relationship is closest in the case of [[nilpotent Lie group]]s.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Fulton-Harris}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Kobayashi, Shoshichi  |author2=Nomizu, Katsumi | title = Foundations of Differential Geometry, Vol. 1 | publisher=Wiley-Interscience | year=1996|edition=New |isbn = 978-0-471-15733-5|title-link=Foundations of Differential Geometry }}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Adjoint Representation Of A Lie Group}}\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n", "name_user": "Gkpotter", "label": "safe", "comment": "g should be an element of GL(n,k) and not 'any' matrix.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoint_representation"}

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television, Aeon Flux, and [[Twin Peak|Twin Peaks]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a livestream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animationmagazine.net/streaming/light-at-the-end-of-the-apocalypse-pen-ward-duncan-trussell-preach-the-midnight-gospel/|title=Light at the End of the Apocalypse: Pen Ward & Duncan Trussell Preach 'The Midnight Gospel'|website=Animation Magazine|first=Ramin|last=Zahed|date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Mike Mayfield joined the project as supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> The main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation. They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like Space Ghost: Coast 2 Coast and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others shows included [[Watership Down]], [[The Last Unicorn]], Liquid Television, Aeon Flux, and [[Twin Peak|Twin Peaks]].<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation <ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. As part of promoting the show, Netflix's YouTube channel launched a live stream on April 19, 2020 with a countdown to the series' debut on the streaming service. Throughout the live stream, small portions of the episodes were shown as well as a psychedelic animation.<ref name=\"Countdown\"/>\n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by [[Netflix]], was released on April 20, 2020. According to Trussell, the Netflix executives first suggested dropping the series on the unofficial stoner holiday and Ward suggests putting the show out on 4/20. The date is Trussell's birthday and [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]-oriented celebrations that take place annually on April 20.<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "Prince Silversaddle", "label": "safe", "comment": "One word, not two.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}
