In 1965, the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] adapted, under the editorship of Bernard Orchard OSB and [[Reginald C. Fuller]], the [[Revised Standard Version|Revised Standard Version (RSV)]] for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] use. It contains the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the [[Vulgate]]. The editors' stated aim for the RSV Catholic Edition was \"to make the minimum number of alterations, and to change only what seemed absolutely necessary in the light of Catholic tradition.\"<ref>''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'', \"Introduction to the 1966 Edition\"</ref>\n\nThe Psalms preserved the numbering of the RSV (which reflects the Masoretic numbering), accompanying it with the Septuagint numbering system in brackets, in line with the [[Vulgate#Nova Vulgate|New Vulgate]], which is the official Latin version for the Catholic Church.\n\nNoted for the [[formal equivalence]] of its translation, it is widely used and quoted by Catholic scholars and theologians, and is used for scripture quotations in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]. The RSV is considered the first [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Bible and brought together the two traditions \u2013 the Catholic [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] and the Protestant [[King James Version|Authorised Version]].<ref>Mgr Andrew Burnham: The Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham | http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/news/OrdinariateNews.php?Mgr-Andrew-Burnham-The-Customary-of-Our-Lady-of-Walsingham-121</ref>\n\nToday, the original 1966 edition of the RSV-CE is still published by [[Ignatius Press]], [[Scepter Publishers]], [[Oxford University Press]], and [[Saint Benedict Press]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Revised Standard Version | Revised Standard Version (RSV)]] stands within the tradition of the [[King James Version|Authorized (King James) Version (KJV)]], which was updated in 1885 in the UK as the [[Revised Version]], with an American edition known as the [[American Standard Version]] published in 1901. The latter version was revised from 1937-1952 by a Standard Bible Committee authorized by the [[National Council of Churches]]; this was known as the Revised Standard Version. A revision of the [[Apocrypha]] was authorized in December of that year, and would be completed in 1957.\n\nThe 1943 [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] of [[Pope Pius XII]], ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', encouraged translations of the [[Catholic Bible]] from the original languages instead of the [[Vulgate]] alone, as had been the tradition since the [[Council of Trent]]. \"It was in fact with a view to filling this rather obvious gap in the shortest possible time that some Catholic scholars considered the possibility of so editing the Revised Standard Version, on its appearance in 1952, as to make it acceptable to Catholic readers.\"<ref>''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'', \"Introduction to the 1966 Edition\"</ref>\n\nIn 1954, after a year of negotiations, the [[American Standard Version|Standard Bible]] Committee granted the Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain permission to print a Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSV-CE) Bible. Originally, the RSV-CE New Testament was to have been issued as early as 1956, but [[Bernard Griffin|Cardinal Griffin]], who had approved the plan, died before he could give it an imprimatur. A delay of nearly a decade ensued before [[Gordon Gray (cardinal)|Archbishop Gray]] of St. Andrews and Edinburgh gave the RSV-CE New Testament the necessary imprimatur.\n\nAnd so at last, in 1965, the RSV-CE New Testament was published.<ref>Reginald C. Fuller, gen. ed. ''A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture''. London: Nelson, Ltd.; 1969</ref> In the following year, 1966, the full RSV-CE Bible was published, with the deuterocanonical works incorporated into the Old Testament text. The deuterocanonical [[Prayer of Manasseh]], [[1 Esdras]], [[2 Esdras]], [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]] and [[Psalm 151]], which are part of the [[Septuagint]] but not of the [[Deuterocanonical books#In the Catholic Church|Catholic canon]], were not added.\n\n== Considerations for an RSV Catholic Edition ==\n{{BibleHistory}}\n\nA [[Catholic Bible]] differs in the number, order, and occasionally preferred emphasis than books typically found in Bibles used by [[Protestant]]s. The [[Catholic Church]] declares: \"Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own that very ancient [[Koine Greek|Greek]] translation of the [[Old Testament]] which is called the [[septuagint]]; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the [[vulgate]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html | title = Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, ''Dei verbum'' |accessdate = 2015-01-21 | publisher = Vatican | location = Vatican}}</ref> Not all the books in the Septuagint<ref>The Oxford University Press publication, {{cite book|last1=Pietersma|first1=Albert|last2=Wright|first2=Benjamin G.|title=A New English Translation of the Septuagint|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199743971|pages=v\u2013vi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17CBLsFpnsgC&pg=PR5&dq=Pietersma+Septuagint+Contents&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-aLAVJDuIo7U7AbnkICwCw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Pietersma%20Septuagint%20Contents&f=false|accessdate=22 January 2015}}, lists in its table of contents the books included in the Septuagint</ref> are included among those that the Catholic Church considers to be part of the Old Testament.<ref>Examples of Septuagint books not granted canonical status by the Catholic Church are [[Esdras|3 and 4 Esdras]], [[3 Maccabees]] and [[4 Maccabees]].</ref> On the other hand, the early Eastern translation known as the [[Peshitta]] excluded five [[New Testament]] books that the Catholic Church declares to be canonical. Translations used by Protestants typically use the shorter [[Masoretic Text]] as their basis regarding the Old Testament. The [[Luther Bible]] included what he called the [[Apocrypha]] and changed the traditional order of some of the New Testament books.\n\nSome minor changes were made to New Testament texts where variant readings aligned better with Catholic understanding and tradition. An appendix to the RSV Catholic Edition documented its departures from the 1962 RSV New Testament. Some of the more important changes were: \n*the use of the phrase \"full of grace\" in the angel's greeting to Mary (Luke 1:28)\n*the restoration of the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 7:53-8:11) \n*the inclusion of the longer ending to the Gospel according to Mark (16.9-20).\n\nSome disputed verses or phrases that had been footnoted in the RSV were restored in the Catholic Edition (Luke 22.19-20; 24. 5, 12, 36, 40, 51-52). Footnotes regarding the value of New Testament coins were rewritten in terms of how long it took the average worker to earn the money (e.g. the denarius was no longer defined as \"twenty cents\" but as \"a day's wage\"). The [[Book of Revelation]], called \"The Revelation To John\", had added as a subtitle (\"The Apocalypse\"). Some of the changes made in the RSV Catholic Edition were later introduced into the RSV Second Edition of the New Testament in 1971 in preparation for the issuance of the RSV Common Bible.\n\n== RSV Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE) ==\n\n[[Image:RSV-SCE.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cover of \"The Ignatius Bible\" (RSV2CE), designed by Christopher J. Pelicano, featuring [[Christ Pantocrator]] at the center and the [[Four Evangelists]] [[Tetramorph]] at the corners.]]\nIn early 2006, [[Ignatius Press]] released the Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE).

In 1965, the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] adapted, under the editorship of Bernard Orchard OSB and [[Reginald C. Fuller]], the [[Revised Standard Version|Revised Standard Version (RSV)]] for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] use. It contains the [[deuterocanonical]] books of the Old Testament placed in the traditional order of the [[Vulgate]]. The editors' stated aim for the RSV Catholic Edition was \"to make the minimum number of alterations, and to change only what seemed absolutely necessary in the light of Catholic tradition.\"<ref>''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'', \"Introduction to the 1966 Edition\"</ref>\n\nThe Psalms preserved the numbering of the RSV (which reflects the Masoretic numbering), accompanying it with the Septuagint numbering system in brackets, in line with the [[Vulgate#Nova Vulgate|New Vulgate]], which is the official Latin version for the Catholic Church.\n\nNoted for the [[formal equivalence]] of its translation, it is widely used and quoted by Catholic scholars and theologians, and is used for scripture quotations in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]. The RSV is considered the first [[Ecumenism|ecumenical]] Bible and brought together the two traditions \u2013 the Catholic [[Douay-Rheims Bible]] and the Protestant [[King James Version|Authorised Version]].<ref>Mgr Andrew Burnham: The Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham | http://www.ordinariate.org.uk/news/OrdinariateNews.php?Mgr-Andrew-Burnham-The-Customary-of-Our-Lady-of-Walsingham-121</ref>\n\nToday, the original 1966 edition of the RSV-CE is still published by Ignatius Press, [[Scepter Publishers]], [[Oxford University Press]], and [[Saint Benedict Press]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe [[Revised Standard Version | Revised Standard Version (RSV)]] stands within the tradition of the [[King James Version|Authorized (King James) Version (KJV)]], which was updated in 1885 in the UK as the [[Revised Version]], with an American edition known as the [[American Standard Version]] published in 1901. The latter version was revised from 1937-1952 by a Standard Bible Committee authorized by the [[National Council of Churches]]; this was known as the Revised Standard Version. A revision of the [[Apocrypha]] was authorized in December of that year, and would be completed in 1957.\n\nThe 1943 [[Encyclical#Catholic usage|encyclical]] of [[Pope Pius XII]], ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', encouraged translations of the [[Catholic Bible]] from the original languages instead of the [[Vulgate]] alone, as had been the tradition since the [[Council of Trent]]. \"It was in fact with a view to filling this rather obvious gap in the shortest possible time that some Catholic scholars considered the possibility of so editing the Revised Standard Version, on its appearance in 1952, as to make it acceptable to Catholic readers.\"<ref>''Revised Standard Version, Second Catholic Edition'', \"Introduction to the 1966 Edition\"</ref>\n\nIn 1954, after a year of negotiations, the [[American Standard Version|Standard Bible]] Committee granted the Catholic Biblical Association of Great Britain permission to print a Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition (RSV-CE) Bible. Originally, the RSV-CE New Testament was to have been issued as early as 1956, but [[Bernard Griffin|Cardinal Griffin]], who had approved the plan, died before he could give it an imprimatur. A delay of nearly a decade ensued before [[Gordon Gray (cardinal)|Archbishop Gray]] of St. Andrews and Edinburgh gave the RSV-CE New Testament the necessary imprimatur.\n\nAnd so at last, in 1965, the RSV-CE New Testament was published.<ref>Reginald C. Fuller, gen. ed. ''A New Catholic Commentary on Holy Scripture''. London: Nelson, Ltd.; 1969</ref> In the following year, 1966, the full RSV-CE Bible was published, with the deuterocanonical works incorporated into the Old Testament text. The deuterocanonical [[Prayer of Manasseh]], [[1 Esdras]], [[2 Esdras]], [[3 Maccabees]], [[4 Maccabees]] and [[Psalm 151]], which are part of the [[Septuagint]] but not of the [[Deuterocanonical books#In the Catholic Church|Catholic canon]], were not added.\n\n== Considerations for an RSV Catholic Edition ==\n{{BibleHistory}}\n\nA [[Catholic Bible]] differs in the number, order, and occasionally preferred emphasis than books typically found in Bibles used by [[Protestant]]s. The [[Catholic Church]] declares: \"Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own that very ancient [[Koine Greek|Greek]] translation of the [[Old Testament]] which is called the [[septuagint]]; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the [[vulgate]].\"<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html | title = Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation, ''Dei verbum'' |accessdate = 2015-01-21 | publisher = Vatican | location = Vatican}}</ref> Not all the books in the Septuagint<ref>The Oxford University Press publication, {{cite book|last1=Pietersma|first1=Albert|last2=Wright|first2=Benjamin G.|title=A New English Translation of the Septuagint|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199743971|pages=v\u2013vi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17CBLsFpnsgC&pg=PR5&dq=Pietersma+Septuagint+Contents&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-aLAVJDuIo7U7AbnkICwCw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Pietersma%20Septuagint%20Contents&f=false|accessdate=22 January 2015}}, lists in its table of contents the books included in the Septuagint</ref> are included among those that the Catholic Church considers to be part of the Old Testament.<ref>Examples of Septuagint books not granted canonical status by the Catholic Church are [[Esdras|3 and 4 Esdras]], [[3 Maccabees]] and [[4 Maccabees]].</ref> On the other hand, the early Eastern translation known as the [[Peshitta]] excluded five [[New Testament]] books that the Catholic Church declares to be canonical. Translations used by Protestants typically use the shorter [[Masoretic Text]] as their basis regarding the Old Testament. The [[Luther Bible]] included what he called the [[Apocrypha]] and changed the traditional order of some of the New Testament books.\n\nSome minor changes were made to New Testament texts where variant readings aligned better with Catholic understanding and tradition. An appendix to the RSV Catholic Edition documented its departures from the 1962 RSV New Testament. Some of the more important changes were: \n*the use of the phrase \"full of grace\" in the angel's greeting to Mary (Luke 1:28)\n*the restoration of the story of the woman caught in adultery (John 7:53-8:11) \n*the inclusion of the longer ending to the Gospel according to Mark (16.9-20).\n\nSome disputed verses or phrases that had been footnoted in the RSV were restored in the Catholic Edition (Luke 22.19-20; 24. 5, 12, 36, 40, 51-52). Footnotes regarding the value of New Testament coins were rewritten in terms of how long it took the average worker to earn the money (e.g. the denarius was no longer defined as \"twenty cents\" but as \"a day's wage\"). The [[Book of Revelation]], called \"The Revelation To John\", had added as a subtitle (\"The Apocalypse\"). Some of the changes made in the RSV Catholic Edition were later introduced into the RSV Second Edition of the New Testament in 1971 in preparation for the issuance of the RSV Common Bible.\n\n== RSV Second Catholic Edition (RSV-2CE) ==\n\n[[Image:RSV-SCE.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Cover of \"The Ignatius Bible\" (RSV2CE), designed by Christopher J.

However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner [[George Mikan]] suggested moving the team to Denver.

Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976.\n\nWith the drafting and signing of future hall of fame player [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]], [[Marvin Webster]] and the acquisitions of [[Dan Issel]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] and with [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two seasons as the Nuggets. Playing in the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]] for the last season the 1974\u201375 team went 65\u201316, including a 40\u20132 record at home. However, a quick playoff exit followed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Denver-Rockets.html |title=Denver Rockets |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975\u201376, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets edged the reigning champion [[Kentucky Colonels]] four games to three to make the [[1976 ABA Playoffs|1976 ABA finals]] for the first time. Eventually, they lost to the [[New York Nets]] and [[Julius Erving]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They did not get a second chance to win an ABA league championship, as the [[American Basketball Association\u2013National Basketball Association merger|ABA\u2013NBA merger]] took place after the 1975\u201376 season.

The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were given many financial issues including a $2 million entry fee. [[Red McCombs]] bought the team in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their team's performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired [[Doug Moe]] as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as his colleagues. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often{{quantify|date=June 2015}} scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981\u201382 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games.<ref name=\"NBA Records\">{{cite web|title=Team Records: Offense|url=https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|work=2017-18 Official National Basketball Association Guide|date=October 30, 2017|accessdate=June 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225072133/https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 1981\u201382 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.\n\n===1982\u20131989: The Alex English era===\nAnchored by scoring machines [[Alex English]] and [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting [[Detroit Pistons]] combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple [[Overtime (sport)#Basketball|overtime]], 186\u2013184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]], they made it to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in 5 games to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nVandeweghe was traded before the 1984\u201385 season to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for 6\u20133 rebounding guard [[Fat Lever]], undersized power forward [[Calvin Natt]] and center [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]]. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists [[Bill Hanzlik]] and [[TR Dunn]], the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to [[Sidney Shlenker]] in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to [[COMSAT]] in 1989.\n\n===1989\u20131991: A period of decline===\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by [[Paul Westhead]]. Westhead also believed in a \"[[run and gun (basketball)|run and gun]]\" style of play, and gave the green light for players like [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] and [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf|Chris Jackson]] to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession.\n[[File:Dikembe mutombo as a nugget.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dikembe Mutombo was drafted by the Nuggets in 1991.]]\nHowever, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense could not keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990\u201391 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the \"Enver Nuggets\" (as in no \"D\", or no defense).\n\n===1991\u20131996: The Dikembe Mutombo era===\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] center [[Dikembe Mutombo]] in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24\u201358 that year.\n\nDenver fired Westhead prior to the 1992\u201393 season and hired former star player [[Dan Issel]] as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|University of Notre Dame]] [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[LaPhonso Ellis]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]] [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Bryant Stith]]. Denver improved to 36\u201346, just missing the playoffs that year.\n\nDenver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993\u201394 season. Led by Mutombo, [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]] (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42\u201340. Denver clinched the 8th seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in [[Seattle]], the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98\u201394. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the [[Utah Jazz]] in Game 7 of the second round.\n\nDenver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter [[Dale Ellis]] in the off-season and drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] guard [[Jalen Rose]]. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach [[Gene Littles]] assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager [[Bernie Bickerstaff]]. Denver rebounded and earned the 8th seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341. The Nuggets were swept by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the first round of the playoffs that season.\n\nFollowing that season, Denver acquired [[Antonio McDyess]] in a draft day trade with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995\u201396 season for the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the [[Sacramento Kings]] prior to the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n===1997\u20132003: Another period of struggle===\nAfter finishing the 1996\u201397 season with the fourth worst record in the league (21\u201361), the Nuggets sent [[Antonio McDyess]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]], and [[Dale Ellis]] returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]], by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst ''single-season'' losing streak at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|23]]\u2014only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]], also with the Cavaliers.\n\n====New ownerships====\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to [[Liberty Media]].<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\"/> However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the [[Atlanta Braves]]), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graser |first1=Marc |title=Liberty Media buys Ascent |url=https://variety.com/2000/biz/news/liberty-media-buys-ascent-1117776651/ |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to [[Walmart]] heirs [[Nancy Walton Laurie|Bill and Nancy Laurie]] for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.<ref name=Press>Schley, Stewart.

Colorado Biz, June 1, 2006.</ref>\n\nHowever, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.<ref name=bizjournal>Moore, Paula.

Just before the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply could not make due to the unstable ownership situation (since all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty ''and'' Sturm).<ref>[http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/1999/1111/164615.html Nuggets roster moves put on hold].

Their 54\u201328 record matched the most wins the franchise had gotten since their induction in the NBA; their 27\u201314 start was also a record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had back-to-back 50-win seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and placing #2 in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team has ever been seeded for the playoffs. [[General Manager]] [[Mark Warkentien]] won the [[NBA Executive of the Year Award]] for the Nuggets' improvement. They won Game 1 of the playoffs in a blowout victory against the [[2008\u201309 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]], the first time they had home-court advantage since [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1988]] and also, the 29-point victory was the largest victory for any team for Game 1 of the first round of the [[2009 NBA Playoffs]].

That was also the first time the Nuggets had ever led 3\u20130 in a best-of-seven series. Up to that point, they held an NBA Playoffs-high in three-pointers made and a 16-point average margin of victory, the largest average margin of victory in the first 10 playoff games in NBA Playoff history. They lost the first game of the Western Conference Finals against the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] but won the second game to tie the series. Anthony became the first Denver player to score at least 30 points in five consecutive playoff games since the Nuggets joined the NBA in 1976.

The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977\u201382, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers.

Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"[[Tetris]]\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of [[Dikembe Mutombo]], the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms).

The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]] season.\n\n===2003\u20132018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold===\nFor the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]] season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with [[Carmelo Anthony]]'s debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark ''(see previous section)'', was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest\u2014it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309]] season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993\u20132003. These jerseys were used until the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315]] season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318]] season.\n\nIn the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306]] season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"gold nugget\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312]] season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the [[2018\u201319 NBA season|2018\u201319]] season\u2014''see next section''.\n\nFor the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313]] season, the Nuggets unveiled a gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons. This jersey featured a return to the Denver \"rainbow skyline\" logo, but used the team's \"Aachen\" typeface and color scheme of powder blue, navy and gold.<ref>{{cite news|author=dbier|title=Nuggets Unveil New Alternate \"Skyline\" Jerseys|url=http://www.nba.com/nuggets/nuggets-unveil-new-alternate-skyline-jerseys|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=October 1, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004023833/http://www.nba.com/nuggets/nuggets-unveil-new-alternate-skyline-jerseys|archivedate=October 4, 2012|accessdate=June 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316]] season, the Nuggets modified the script and numbering fonts on their home and away jerseys, with a gold \"Nuggets\" script on the home white jersey and a gold \"Denver\" script on the powder blue away jersey\u2014both with the \"Coliseum\" typeface. Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white. The numerals were also modified with the Coliseum typeface, but remained white, with powder blue interior trim and navy blue exterior outlining.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lukas|first=Paul|title=Uni changes coming to numerous teams in 2015-16|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12880062/uni-changes-coming-numerous-teams-2015-16|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=May 13, 2015|accessdate=May 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Nuggets updated their uniforms for the 2017\u201318 season.

The current color scheme consists of midnight blue (navy), sunshine yellow, flatirons red (maroon) and skyline blue (royal)\u2014the latter color is only featured on the \"Statement\" jersey and two of the team's new alternate logos. Powder blue, which was the team's dominant road jersey color from [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]] to [[2016\u201317 NBA season|2016\u201317]] and diminished to trim status on the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318]] uniforms, was eliminated from all logos and uniforms. The white \"Association\" jersey features \"Nuggets\" in flatirons red, with sunshine yellow trim and midnight blue numbers with sunshine yellow trim, while the midnight blue \"Icon\" jersey features \"Denver\" in sunshine yellow, with flatirons red trim and white numbers with flatirons red trim. Both sets also include mountain peak striping on the shorts and the pick axe logo on the waistline. The skyline blue \"Statement\" jersey features \"Mile High City\" in white surrounding sunshine yellow numbers, plus a midnight blue mountain peak silhouette and a sunshine yellow pick axe logo on the sides of the shorts. A modernized version of the skyline logo adorns the waistline. The circular \"pick axe logo,\" which had served as the Nuggets' alternate logo since 2005, became the team's new primary logo, replacing the snow-capped mountain/enlarged western-style wordmark logo that had served as the team's primary logo (in three different versions) since 1993. The colors on the circular pick axe logo were also modified with the team's new color scheme.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Denver Nuggets unveil new look|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2018/06/06/denver-nuggets-reveal-new-logos|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=June 6, 2018|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DempseyNuggets\" />\n\n===City Edition uniforms===\nIn the 2017\u201318 season, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] released a fourth uniform option known as the \"City\" series, which is updated annually.

Following that season, the NBL combined with the Basketball Association of America (BAA), with the newly unified circuit named the [[National Basketball Association]] to reflect the merger. The Denver Nuggets played the [[1949\u201350 NBA season|1949\u201350 season]] as one of the charter NBA teams before folding.\n\n===The Denver Rockets and ABA revival===\nIn 1967, one of the ABA's charter franchises was awarded to a group in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], headed by Southern Californian businessman James Trindle. However, Trindle was unable to find a suitable arena in the Kansas City area. League commissioner [[George Mikan]] suggested moving the team to Denver. After agreeing to name Denver resident and former NBA player [[Vince Boryla]] as general manager, Trindle moved his team to Denver as the Denver Larks, named after Colorado's state bird.<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\">[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Denver-Nuggets-Company-History.html Denver Nuggets history] at FundingUniverse</ref> The Trindle group was severely undercapitalized, leading Mikan to order the Larks to post a $100,000 performance bond or lose the franchise. Hours before the deadline, Trindle sold a \u2154 controlling interest to Denver trucking magnate Bill Ringsby for $350,000. Ringsby then renamed the team the Rockets, after his company's long-haul trucks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |title=ABA-era team notes |publisher=Remembertheaba.com |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320020429/http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |archivedate=March 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===1969\u20131976: ABA years===\nPlaying at the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]], the Rockets had early successes on the court, developing a strong fan base along the way.<ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |title=Denver Rockets/Nuggets Year-by-Year Notes |publisher=Remember the ABA |accessdate=March 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130426023343/http://www.remembertheaba.com/TeamMaterial/DenverMaterial/RocketsNuggetsYearly.html |archivedate=April 26, 2013 }}</ref> However, the team had a history of early playoff exits and failed to play in the ABA championship series.\n\nEarly, Denver had a solid lineup led by [[Byron Beck]] and [[Larry Jones (basketball)|Larry Jones]], then later by Beck and [[Ralph Simpson]]. [[Lonnie Wright]] of the [[American Football League]]'s [[Denver Broncos]] signed with the Rockets during that first season and became the first player to play professional football and basketball in the same season. Wright played four seasons with Denver.<ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\"/> Controversial rookie [[Spencer Haywood]] joined the team for the 1969\u201370 season. Haywood was one of the first players to turn pro before graduating from college, and the NBA initially refused to let him play in the league. Haywood averaged nearly 30 points and 19.5 rebounds per game in his only ABA season, being named ABA MVP, ABA rookie of the year, as well as the All-Star Game MVP. The team finished 51\u201333, winning their division, before exiting the playoffs in the 2nd round.\n\nJust before the start of the 1970\u201371 season, Haywood signed with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], jumping to the NBA. The team tumbled to a 30\u201354 record and attendance suffered.<ref name=\"remembertheaba.com\"/>\n\n====Becoming the Denver Nuggets====\nRingsby sold the team to [[San Diego]] businessmen Frank Goldberg and Bud Fischer in 1972.<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\"/> In 1974, in anticipation of moving into the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and the new [[McNichols Arena]], the franchise held a contest to choose a new team nickname, as \"Rockets\" was already in use by the [[Houston Rockets]]. The winning choice was \"Nuggets\", in honor of the original [[Denver Nuggets (original)|Nuggets]] team in Denver from 1948\u201350, the last year as a charter member of the NBA. Their new logo was a miner \"discovering\" an ABA ball. Goldberg and Fischer in turn sold the team to a local investment group in 1976.\n\nWith the drafting and signing of future hall of fame player [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]] out of [[NC State Wolfpack men's basketball|North Carolina State]], [[Marvin Webster]] and the acquisitions of [[Dan Issel]] and [[Bobby Jones (basketball, born 1951)|Bobby Jones]] and with [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] coaching, they had their best seasons in team history in their first two seasons as the Nuggets. Playing in the [[Denver Auditorium Arena]] for the last season the 1974\u201375 team went 65\u201316, including a 40\u20132 record at home. However, a quick playoff exit followed.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Denver-Rockets.html |title=Denver Rockets |publisher=Remember the ABA |date= |accessdate=March 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975\u201376, playing at their new arena, the Nuggets edged the reigning champion [[Kentucky Colonels]] four games to three to make the [[1976 ABA Playoffs|1976 ABA finals]] for the first time.

The Nuggets continued their strong play early on in the NBA, as they won division titles in their first two seasons in the league, and missed a third by a single game. However, neither of these teams were ultimately successful in the postseason. Similarly to the other new NBA teams, the Nuggets were given many financial issues including a $2 million entry fee. [[Red McCombs]] bought the team in 1978.\n\nIn 1979, Brown left the team, helping usher in a brief decline in their team's performance. It ended in 1981, when they hired [[Doug Moe]] as a head coach. Moe brought with him a \"motion offense\" philosophy, a style of play focusing on attempting to move the ball until someone got open. Moe was also known for not paying as much attention to defense as his colleagues. The offense helped the team become highly competitive. During the 1980s, the Nuggets often{{quantify|date=June 2015}} scored in excess of 115 points a game, and during the 1981\u201382 season, they scored at least 100 points in every game. The NBA-record streak was halted at 136 consecutive games.<ref name=\"NBA Records\">{{cite web|title=Team Records: Offense|url=https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|work=2017-18 Official National Basketball Association Guide|date=October 30, 2017|accessdate=June 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225072133/https://turnernbahangtime.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/2017-18-official-nba-guide_v2.pdf#page=205|archive-date=December 25, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the 1981\u201382 season, the Nuggets set the league scoring record for the highest points per game average at 126.5 points.\n\n===1982\u20131989: The Alex English era===\nAnchored by scoring machines [[Alex English]] and [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] at the two forward spots, and Dan Issel at center, Denver led the league in scoring, with English and Vandeweghe both averaging above 25 points per game. It was a novel strategy, allowing the Nuggets to top the Midwest Division and qualify for the playoffs during that span. (On December 13, 1983, the Nuggets and the visiting [[Detroit Pistons]] combined for an NBA record 370 points, with Detroit winning in triple [[Overtime (sport)#Basketball|overtime]], 186\u2013184.) At the end of the season, English won the NBA scoring title, becoming the only Nugget to win the award despite the heavily favored offensive play of Doug Moe. In [[1984\u201385 NBA season|1984\u201385]], they made it to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] finals after being perennial playoff contenders, and they lost in 5 games to the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].\n\nVandeweghe was traded before the 1984\u201385 season to the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] for 6\u20133 rebounding guard [[Fat Lever]], undersized power forward [[Calvin Natt]] and center [[Wayne Cooper (basketball)|Wayne Cooper]]. Spearheaded by Alex English and supported by the three new acquisitions and defensive specialists [[Bill Hanzlik]] and [[TR Dunn]], the team replicated its success in the Western Conference despite the loss of Vandeweghe. They even managed to win 54 games in the [[1987\u201388 NBA season|1987\u201388 season]], the most they had ever won as an NBA team. However, the Mavericks eliminated the Nuggets in the second round of the 1988 NBA Playoffs. McCombs sold the team to [[Sidney Shlenker]] in 1985. Shlenker, in turn, sold the team to [[COMSAT]] in 1989.\n\n===1989\u20131991: A period of decline===\nMoe left the team in 1990, and was replaced by [[Paul Westhead]]. Westhead also believed in a \"[[run and gun (basketball)|run and gun]]\" style of play, and gave the green light for players like [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] and [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf|Chris Jackson]] to light up the scoreboards within seconds of possession.\n[[File:Dikembe mutombo as a nugget.jpg|alt=|thumb|Dikembe Mutombo was drafted by the Nuggets in 1991.]]\nHowever, Westhead cared even less about defense than Moe. As a result, the Nuggets gave up points so quickly that even their prolific offense could not keep up. They finished with the worst record in the league during the 1990\u201391 season, despite setting many scoring records. As an insult, many sportswriters nicknamed the team at the time as the \"Enver Nuggets\" (as in no \"D\", or no defense).\n\n===1991\u20131996: The Dikembe Mutombo era===\nDenver took a positive step in rebuilding by drafting [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown University]] center [[Dikembe Mutombo]] in 1991. Mutombo finished runner-up to [[Larry Johnson (basketball, born 1969)|Larry Johnson]] for the NBA rookie of the year that season. Denver finished 24\u201358 that year.\n\nDenver fired Westhead prior to the 1992\u201393 season and hired former star player [[Dan Issel]] as his successor. The Nuggets had two lottery picks that year and drafted [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|University of Notre Dame]] [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[LaPhonso Ellis]] and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|University of Virginia]] [[guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Bryant Stith]]. Denver improved to 36\u201346, just missing the playoffs that year.\n\nDenver ditched their rainbow colors for a dark navy, metallic gold and wine color scheme starting in the 1993\u201394 season. Led by Mutombo, [[Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf]] (who changed his name from Chris Jackson prior to the season), and Ellis, Denver finished with its first winning season since the Doug Moe era at 42\u201340. Denver clinched the 8th seed in the Western Conference playoffs, playing the first place [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Denver was a heavy underdog, having only a couple of players on their roster with actual NBA playoff experience. After dropping the first two games of the five-game set in [[Seattle]], the series returned to Denver. Denver won both games and tied the series at 2. The Nuggets made NBA history in Game 5, upsetting Seattle in overtime 98\u201394. They became the first 8th-seeded team to defeat a 1st-seeded team in NBA playoff history. Denver almost repeated the feat before falling to the [[Utah Jazz]] in Game 7 of the second round.\n\nDenver acquired Sonics sharp-shooter [[Dale Ellis]] in the off-season and drafted [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|University of Michigan]] guard [[Jalen Rose]]. Denver struggled, causing Issel to resign as coach partway into the season. Assistant Coach [[Gene Littles]] assumed control for a brief period before relinquishing control to general manager [[Bernie Bickerstaff]]. Denver rebounded and earned the 8th seed again in the playoffs, finishing 41\u201341. The Nuggets were swept by the [[San Antonio Spurs]] in the first round of the playoffs that season.\n\nFollowing that season, Denver acquired [[Antonio McDyess]] in a draft day trade with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. McDyess was the face of the franchise for the next few years, as Mutombo left after the 1995\u201396 season for the [[Atlanta Hawks]], Ellis missed the majority of the next few seasons due to recurring knee and leg injuries, Rose was traded to the [[Indiana Pacers]] for [[Mark Jackson (basketball)|Mark Jackson]], and Abdul-Rauf was traded to the [[Sacramento Kings]] prior to the 1996\u201397 season.\n\n===1997\u20132003: Another period of struggle===\nAfter finishing the 1996\u201397 season with the fourth worst record in the league (21\u201361), the Nuggets sent [[Antonio McDyess]] to the [[Phoenix Suns]], and [[Dale Ellis]] returned to Seattle. Denver flirted with history in the [[1997\u201398 NBA season|1997\u201398]], by nearly setting the mark for fewest wins in an 82-game season (11). They tied the then-NBA's all-time worst ''single-season'' losing streak at [[List of National Basketball Association longest losing streaks|23]]\u2014only one game shy of the overall worst mark of 24 by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] of the early 1980s. The losing streak was later broken by the Cavaliers in 2011 and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in 2014 with 26 consecutive losses. Several years later, the Nuggets tied for the worst record in the NBA in [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]], also with the Cavaliers.\n\n====New ownerships====\nThe team's struggles in the late 1990s were due in part to ownership instability. COMSAT bought the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Quebec Nordiques]] in 1995 and moved them to Denver as the [[Colorado Avalanche]]. However, its diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated with the construction of Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent Entertainment Group, the umbrella corporation for its sporting assets, to [[Liberty Media]].<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\"/> However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought the [[Atlanta Braves]]), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graser |first1=Marc |title=Liberty Media buys Ascent |url=https://variety.com/2000/biz/news/liberty-media-buys-ascent-1117776651/ |website=Variety |publisher=Variety |accessdate=25 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter almost two years, Ascent sold the Avalanche and Nuggets to [[Walmart]] heirs [[Nancy Walton Laurie|Bill and Nancy Laurie]] for $400 million. However, a group of Ascent shareholders sued, claiming that the sale price was several million dollars too low. Ascent then agreed to sell the Avalanche and Nuggets to Denver banking tycoon Donald Sturm for $461 million.<ref name=Press>Schley, Stewart.

Colorado Biz, June 1, 2006.</ref>\n\nHowever, a new wrinkle appeared when the city of Denver refused to transfer the parcel of land on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had bought the teams in his own name, and the city wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he was not willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.<ref name=bizjournal>Moore, Paula.

[[Denver Business Journal]], July 17, 2000.</ref> In the meantime, Issel had returned as head coach in 1999, but the protracted ownership negotiations made it difficult for him to rebuild the team. Just before the start of the 1999\u20132000 season, he told reporters there were several personnel moves he simply could not make due to the unstable ownership situation (since all basketball decisions required the approval of both Ascent/Liberty ''and'' Sturm).<ref>[http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/1999/1111/164615.html Nuggets roster moves put on hold]. [[ESPN]], November 11, 1999.</ref>\n\nFinally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center were bought by real estate entrepreneur [[Stan Kroenke]] in a $450 million deal.<ref name=\"nuggetscompanyhistory\"/> Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife [[Ann Walton Kroenke|Ann]] is Nancy Laurie's sister.

When the Nuggets joined the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] in the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377]] season, they retained the pick-axe logo on their jerseys from the ABA days. The home uniforms feature \"Nuggets\" in red, with a red pick-axe inside a blue oval, and gold numbers with blue trim in front, blue numbers and letters at the back. The road uniforms were blue, with \"Denver\" in blue with a blue pick-axe in a red oval, and gold numbers in front, white numbers and letters at the back. The Nuggets simplified their uniforms following their inaugural season in the NBA. From 1977\u201382, their home uniforms were white, with a \"Nuggets\" script written across the chest in a darker royal blue, with gold trim around the script and jersey numbers. The royal blue away jersey had \"Denver\" written across the chest in white, with gold trim.\n\n===1981\u20131993: Rainbow City Skyline===\nFrom [[1981\u201382 NBA season|1981\u201382]] through [[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]], the Nuggets wore the Denver \"rainbow city\" skyline across the chest and back on both the home and away uniforms. Some fans also call the iconic 1980s logo the \"[[Tetris]]\" logo, due to the buildings that shadow the mountains on the logo which are in the shape of squares. The initial home uniforms were white with navy and green trim, with \"Nuggets\" and the uniform number in gold with blue trim. The player names were written in block lettering and in a straight position. In 1985, they changed the shade of blue to royal and eliminated green, and in 1986, changed the back numbers to royal blue. In 1991, coinciding with the debut of [[Dikembe Mutombo]], the word \"Nuggets\" became white with royal blue and gold trim. The road uniforms were initially navy blue with green trim, with \"Denver\" and the uniform number in white with gold trim, before likewise changing it to royal blue, with gold serifed block letters for player names in an arch (royal blue in home uniforms). The font and \"skyline\" logo were later reintroduced on alternate jerseys beginning with the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313]] season\u2014''see below''.\n\n===1993\u20132003: Navy blue, metallic gold and maroon===\nFor the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394]] season, the Nuggets drastically changed their look, with a navy blue, metallic gold and maroon color scheme on their uniforms. The \"rainbow city skyline,\" which had been synonymous with the team since 1981, was replaced with a logo that featured a navy blue snow-capped mountain above an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" wordmark in metallic gold, and a curved maroon ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark positioned in between the mountain and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark. The home jerseys had a \"Nuggets\" script in a modified version of the typeface Aachen across the chest in navy blue, with maroon and metallic gold trim around the script and numbers, while the navy blue away jerseys had the same script in metallic gold, with maroon and white trim. The Nuggets wore these uniforms for a decade, until the end of the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303]] season.\n\n===2003\u20132018: Powder blue, navy blue and gold===\nFor the [[2003\u201304 NBA season|2003\u201304]] season, the Nuggets made another uniform change, coinciding with [[Carmelo Anthony]]'s debut, with a color scheme of powder blue, gold (yellow) and royal blue. The primary logo, featuring a snow-capped mountain, curved ribbon with a \"Denver\" wordmark and an enlarged western-style \"Nuggets\" workmark ''(see previous section)'', was modified, with the mountain royal blue, the ribbon powder blue and the \"Nuggets\" wordmark a golden yellow. Like the 1990s uniforms, the Nuggets' revised jerseys also had the \"Aachen\" typeface across the chest\u2014it was \"Nuggets\" in powder blue, with royal blue and gold trim on the home white jersey, while the powder blue road jerseys had \"Denver\" in white, with gold and royal blue trim. These jerseys, along with the team logo, were tweaked prior to the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309]] season, with the royal blue replaced by the shade of navy blue that was part of the team's color scheme from 1993\u20132003. These jerseys were used until the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315]] season, while the snow-capped mountain logo would serve as the team's primary logo until the [[2017\u201318 NBA season|2017\u201318]] season.\n\nIn the [[2005\u201306 NBA season|2005\u201306]] season, the Nuggets also introduced an alternate logo, as well as an alternate navy blue uniform. The alternate logo featured twin intersecting gold pick axes in a powder blue circle, with a half-white/half-yellow \"gold nugget\" at the top of the circle and a basketball with gold outlining and navy blue accents at the bottom of the circle. The navy blue jersey featured an alternate \"Nuggets\" script in gold, with navy blue interior trim and powder blue outlining. This uniform was used until the end of the [[2011\u201312 NBA season|2011\u201312]] season, while the circular \"pick axe\" logo would become the team's new primary logo for the [[2018\u201319 NBA season|2018\u201319]] season\u2014''see next section''.\n\nFor the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313]] season, the Nuggets unveiled a gold alternate jersey, replacing the aforementioned navy blue jerseys that had been used during the previous seven seasons.

Navy blue numerals trimmed in gold, as well as navy blue nameplates, were featured on both the home and away jerseys. The alternate gold \"skyline\" jerseys were also tweaked, with a retro \"Nuggets\" wordmark (that was used on the 1980s rainbow skyline jerseys) in navy blue trimmed in white.

It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%).

They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

[[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly. According to the [[Inquisition]] reports, many New Christians living in Brazil during colonial times were condemned for secretly observing [[Judaism|Jewish customs]].<ref name=jvt>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html Oreck, Alden.

Many Jews came from the Netherlands to live in Brazil in the area dominated by the Dutch. Most of them were descendants of the Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Portugal in 1497. In 1636, the [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], the first [[synagogue]] in the Americas was built in [[Recife]], the capital of [[Dutch Brazil]].<ref name=jvt/> The original building remains to this day,<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/922773.html  Synagogue in Brazilian town Recife considered oldest in the Americas].

They were mainly [[Moroccan Jews]], descendants of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews who had been expelled from Spain in 1492 and Portugal in 1497.\n\nThe first wave of [[Sephardic Jews]] was exceeded by the larger wave of immigration by [[Ashkenazi Jews]] that came at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries, mainly from Russia, Poland, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. A final significant group came, fleeing [[Nazism]] or the destruction that followed World War II.\n\nBrazil has the second-largest Jewish population in Latin America of 120,000 people, making up a total of 0.06% of Brazil's population.<ref name=\"Beit Hatfutsot\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-brazil/|title=The Jewish Community in Brazil|website=Beit Hatfutsot|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref> As of 2017, Rio de Janeiro's Jewish population was 22,000, with 24 active synagogues.{{r|Beit Hatfutsot}}\n\n[[File:Mesquita do Br\u00e1s 1.JPG|thumb|right|Mosque in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n\n=== Islam ===\n{{Main|Islam in Brazil}}\n{{Further|Mal\u00ea Revolt}}\nAccording to the 2010 Census, there were 35,167 [[Islam in Brazil|Muslims]] in Brazil.<ref name=\"census2010a\">ftp://ftp.ibge.gov.br/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2010/Caracteristicas_Gerais_Religiao_Deficiencia/tab1_4.pdf</ref>   The Federation of Muslim Associations of Brazil estimates there are about 1.5 million Muslims and others say about 400.000 to 500.000. There are over 150 mosques where Muslims perform their daily prayers.\n\n[[Islam in Brazil]] may be presumed to have first been practiced by African slaves brought from West Africa. Scholars note that Brazil received more enslaved Muslims than anywhere else in the Americas.<ref>Lovejoy, Paul E., ''Muslim Encounters With Slavery in Brazil'', Markus Wiener Pub., 2007. {{ISBN|1-55876-378-3}}.</ref> During [[Ramadan]], in January 1835, a small group of black slaves and freedmen from [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador da Bahia]], inspired by [[Muslim]] teachers, rose up against the government in the [[Mal\u00ea Revolt]], the largest [[slave rebellion]] in Brazil. (Muslims were called ''mal\u00ea'' in [[Bahia]] at this time, from [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''imale'' that designated a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] Muslim.)  Fearing the example might be followed, the Brazilian authorities began to watch the ''mal\u00eas'' very carefully and in subsequent years intensive efforts were made towards conversions to Catholic Christianity and erase the popular memory of and affection towards [[Islam]].<ref>Joao Jose Reis, ''Slave Rebellion in Brazil: The Muslim Uprising of 1835 in Bahia'', Johns Hopkins University Press, London 1993</ref> However, the African Muslim community was not erased overnight, and as late as 1910 it is estimated there were still some 100,000 African Muslims living in Brazil.<ref>Steven Barboza, ''American Jihad'', 1993</ref>\n\nA recent trend has been the increase in [[Religious conversion#Islam|conversion]]s to Islam among non-Arab citizens.<ref name=religiousfreedom2006>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091130031802/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127381.htm \"Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor International Religious Freedom Report 2009\"] October 26, 2009, US Department of State report on Brazil</ref>\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{Main|Hinduism in Brazil}}\nMost of the Brazilian Hindus are ethnic East [[India]]ns. However, there are new converts due to the missionary effects of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]].\n\nThere are 1,500 PIOs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|People of Indian origin]]) and about 400 NRIs ([[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Non-Resident Indian]]) in Brazil.\n\n;First wave of Immigration\nA small number of Sindhis had arrived here from Suriname and Central America in 1960 to set up shop as traders in the city of [[Manaus]].\n\n;Second wave of Immigration \nConsisted of university professors who arrived in the 190s and also in the 1970s.\n\nOther PIOs migrated to this country from various African countries, mainly from former Portuguese colonies (especially [[Mozambique]]), soon after their independence in the 1970s. The number of PIOs in Brazil has been augmented in recent years by the arrival of nuclear scientists and computer professionals.\n\nThere are as many as 1,500 PIOs among the Indian community in Brazil, and only 400 NRIs since foreign nationals can acquire local citizenship without any discrimination after 15 years of domicile in this country. Brazil has also no bar against dual citizenship. But in recent years, it has been granting immigration visas only in high technology fields. The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ===\n{{main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil}}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] first visiting the country that year,<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> and the first Bah\u00e1'\u00ed [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928.

During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in the country have continued to multiply.

It was introduced among the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Native Brazilians]] by [[Jesuits]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] and also observed by all the Portuguese first settlers.\n\nDuring colonial times, there was no freedom of religion. All Portuguese settlers and Brazilians were compulsorily bound to the Catholic faith and were bound to pay tithes to the church. After the Brazilian independence, the first constitution introduced freedom of religion in 1824, but [[Catholicism]] was kept as the [[official religion]]. The Imperial Government paid a salary to Catholic priest and influenced the appointment of bishops. The political-administrative division of the municipalities accompanied the hierarchical division of the bishoprics in \"''freguesias''\" (parishes). There was also some hindrances to the construction of temples and cemeteries that belonged to the [[Catholic Church]]. The first Republican Constitution in 1891 separated religion from state and made all religions equal in the Codes of Law, but the Catholic Church remained very influential until the 1970s. For example, due to the strong opposition of the Catholic Church, divorce was not allowed in Brazil until 1977 even if a separated couple observed a different religion.\n\nThe Catholic faith practiced in Brazil is full of popular festivities rooted in centuries-old Portuguese traditions, but also heavily influenced by African and [[Native Brazilian]] usage. Popular traditions include pilgrimages to the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida|National Shrine]] of [[Our Lady of Aparecida]] (''Nossa Senhora Aparecida''), the [[patron saint]] of Brazil, and religious festivals like the \"''C\u00edrio de Nazar\u00e9''\" in [[Bel\u00e9m]] and the \"''Festa do Divino''\" in many cities of Central Brazil. Areas that received many European immigrants in the last century, specially Italian and German, have Catholic traditions closer to that practiced in Europe.\n\nThe largest proportion of Catholics is concentrated in the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast]] (79.9%) and [[Southeastern Brazil|South]] (77.4%) regions. The smallest proportion of Catholics is found in the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Center-West]] region (69.1%). The State of [[Piau\u00ed]] has the largest proportion of Catholics (87,93%) and the State of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] has the smallest one (45.19%).

The [[Anglican Episcopal Church of Brazil]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]], has some 120,000 members.

They are concentrated mainly in large urban centers in the Northeast, such as [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Recife]], or [[Rio de Janeiro]] in the Southeast. The cities of [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]] have a great number of followers, but in the South of Brazil the most common African influenced Ritual is Almas e Angola, which is an [[Umbanda]] like ritual. Nowadays, there are over 70 \"terreiros\" (temples) in Florian\u00f3polis, which are the places where the rituals run. In addition to Candombl\u00e9 which is of the [[Yoruba religion]], there is also Umbanda which blends [[Spiritism]] by ways of the same [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] belief system. There is prejudice about \"African cults\" in Brazil's south, but there are Catholics, Protestants and other kinds of Christians who also believe in the [[Orisha]]s, and go both to churches and terreiros.\n\nCandombl\u00e9, Umbanda, Batuque, [[Shango|Xango]], and [[Tambor de Mina]], were originally brought by black [[slavery|slaves]] shipped from Africa to Brazil. These black slaves would summon their gods, called [[Orisha|Orixas]], Voduns or Inkices with chants and dances they had brought from Africa. These cults were persecuted throughout most of Brazilian history, largely because they were believed to be [[Paganism|pagan]] or even [[Satanism|satanic]]. However, the Brazilian [[republic]]an government legalized all of them on the grounds of the necessary separation between the State and the Church in 1889.\n\nIn current practice, Umbanda followers leave offerings of food, candles and flowers in public places for the spirits. Candombl\u00e9 terreiros are more hidden from general view, except in famous festivals such as Iyemanja Festival and the Waters of Oxala in the Northeast.\n\nFrom [[Bahia]] northwards there are different practices such as Catimbo, Jurema with heavy indigenous elements. All over the country, but mainly in the [[Amazon rainforest]], there are many Indians still practicing their original traditions. Many of their beliefs and use of naturally occurring plant derivatives are incorporated into African, Spiritualists and folk religion.\n\nThough these religions have experienced much greater freedom since the decline of the influence of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], they have suffered increasing hostility from [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches, with attacks on temples and defacement of statues of the gods.<ref name=\"Mana2007\">[http://socialsciences.scielo.org/scielo.php?pid=S0104-93132007000100003&script=sci_arttext Neo-Pentecostalism and Afro-Brazilian religions: explaining the attacks on symbols of the African religious heritage in contemporary Brazil].

This is mostly because of the large [[Japanese Brazilian]] community. About a fifth of the Japanese Brazilian community are followers of Buddhism. Japanese Buddhist sects like [[Jodo Shinshu]], [[Nichiren Buddhism]] (most notably the [[Soka Gakkai]]), and [[Zen]] are the most popular. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ([[Vajrayana]]) is also present, since [[Chagdud Tulku Rinpoche]] founded the Khadro Ling center in [[Tr\u00eas Coroas]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (where he lived until his death in 2002), and many other institutions across the country. However, in recent years both Chinese Mahayana and South East Asian Theraveda sects are gaining popularity. Buddhism was introduced to Brazil in the early twentieth century, by Japanese immigrants, although now, 60% of Japanese Brazilians are now Christian due to missionary activities and intermarriage. Nevertheless, Japanese Brazilian culture has a substantial Buddhist influence.\n\n=== Judaism ===\n[[File:Sinagoga-kahal-zur-israel-recife.jpg|thumb|[[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]], (founded 1636) in [[Recife]] was the first Jewish congregation in the Americas.]]\n[[File:Sinagoga Beth El, S\u00e3o Paulo 2.JPG|thumb|right|A synagogue in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]].]]\n{{Main|History of the Jews in Brazil}}\nThe first Jews arrived in Brazil as ''crist\u00e3os-novos'' ([[New Christians]]) or [[conversos]], names applied to Jews or Muslims who converted to Catholicism, most of them forcibly.

The only exceptions are the [[Sindhi people|Sindhis]] in Manaus (who have formed an Indian Association with about a hundred members) and the [[Goa]]ns in S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\nBeside the PIOs, there are [[Hindu]] organizations such as [[ISKCON]], [[Brahma Kumari]]s are very active in Brasil. The number of adherents of these organizations is not officially recorded but is estimated to be a few thousand.\n\n===Positivist Church of Brazil===\n[[File:Pretos-velhos.JPG|thumbnail|Old Black Women and Men Spirits Images]]\nMany confuse Spiritism with Afro-Brazilian Religions like [[Umbanda]], [[Candombl\u00e9]] and others that have a following of almost 600,000 adherents. One of the most unusual features of the rich Brazilian spiritual landscape are the sects which use [[ayahuasca]] (an Amazonian [[entheogen]]ic tea), including [[Santo Daime]], [[Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal]], and Centro de Cultura C\u00f3smica. This syncretism, coupled with ideas prevalent during the military dicatorship, has resulted in a church for the secular, based on philosopher [[Auguste Comte]]'s principles of [[positivism]], based at the Positivist Church of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n=== Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith ===\n{{main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil}}\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Brazil started in 1919 with [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] first visiting the country that year,<ref name=\"alamb\">{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}</ref> and the first Bah\u00e1'\u00ed [[Spiritual Assembly|Local Spiritual Assembly]] in Brazil was established in 1928. There followed a period of growth with the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed)|pioneers]] from the United States finding national Brazilian converts and in 1961 an independent national Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community was formed. During the 1992 [[Earth Summit]], which was held in Brazil, the international and local Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community were given the responsibility for organizing a series of different programs, and since then the involvements of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in the country have continued to multiply.

[[Zoroastrianism]], [[Sanamahism]] and [[Judaism]] also have an ancient history in India, and each has several thousands of Indian adherents.

His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE.

The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]].

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including [[Allahabad]] (officially known as Prayagraj), [[Haridwar]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ujjain]], [[Rameshwaram]] and [[Vrindavan]]. Notable temple cities include [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple.\n\n[[Badrinath]], [[Puri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Rameswaram]] compose the main pilgrimage circuit of ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') hosting the four holiest [[Hindu]] temples:  [[Badrinath Temple]], [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarkadheesh Temple]] and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] respectively. The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]],[[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century. Many of the elements underlying India's [[casteism]] and [[communalism (South Asia)|communalism]] originated during the rule of the [[British India|British Raj]], particularly after the late 19th century; the authorities and others often politicized religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Makkar|1993|p=141}}</ref> The [[Indian Councils Act 1909]] (widely known as the Morley-Minto Reforms Act), which established separate Hindu and Muslim electorates for the Imperial Legislature and provincial councils, was particularly divisive.

The [[Shah Bano case]], a divorce lawsuit, generated much controversy when the Congress was accused of appeasing the Muslim orthodoxy by bringing in a parliamentary amendment to negate the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court's]] decision.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]]. According to the Indian government estimates, the assault caused the deaths of up to 100 soldiers, 250 militants, and hundreds of civilians.<ref name=\"Nichols_2003\">{{cite journal |title=The Politics of Assassination: Case Studies and Analysis |last=Nichols |first=B |journal=Australasian Political Studies Association Conference |year=2003 |url=http://www.utas.edu.au/government/APSA/BNichols.pdf|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThis triggered [[Indira Gandhi]]'s assassination by her outraged Sikh bodyguards on 31 October 1984, which set off a four-day period during which Sikhs were massacred; The [[Government of India]] reported 2,700 Sikh deaths however human rights organizations and newspapers report the death toll to be 10,000\u201317,000.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.\n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931.\n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = Snake River, Washington\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref> the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.\n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids.<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.  There once had been steamboats operating on the upper Columbia river, but by 1883, railroad competition had been so successful that all river boats had been driven off the route.<ref name = WheatFleet>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 =  \n| title = Sternwheelers up Columbia -- A Century of Steamboating in the Oregon Country\n| isbn = 0-8032-5874-7 \n| chapter = Ch. 8: The Wheat Fleet\n| lccn = 77007161 \n| location =  Lincoln NE \n| publisher = University of Nebraska \n| date = 1947 \n| at = 105-106\n}}</ref>  Wheat farming became widespread in the region in the 1880s and 1890s, and the railroads could not handle the larger and larger wheat crops being produced.<ref name = WheatFleet/>  The Open River Navigation company was formed to meet the demands for transport by wheat farmers and shippers, and it built a number of steamers, including ''Relief''.<ref name = WheatFleet/>\n\n== Construction ==\n''Relief'' was rebuilt from the much smaller stern-wheel steamer ''Columbia'' (US registry 127689), which had been {{convert|77|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet long, {{convert|20.4|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} on the [[Beam (nautical)|beam]], with a depth of hold of {{convert|3.6|ft|m|2|lk=on|abbr=on}} feet.<ref name = 1903mvrList>{{cite book\n| last1 = [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Dept]], Statistics Bureau \n| title = Annual List of Merchant Vessels\n| volume = 35\n| type = [[Fiscal year|FY]] end Jun 30, 1903\n| location = [[Washington, DC|Wash.

''Relief'' had been originally built in 1902, on the Columbia at [[Blalock, Oregon]], in [[Gilliam County, Oregon|Gilliam County]], and launched and operated as '''''Columbia''''', a much smaller vessel. ''Relief'' was used primarily as a freight carrier, first for about ten years in the [[Inland Empire]] region of Oregon and Washington, hauling wheat and fruit, and after that was operated on the lower Columbia river.\n\nAfter 1918 the owners of ''Relief'' struggled to find cargo, as railroads and especially highway transport cut sharply into the steamboat share of the transport business.  ''Relief'' was seriously damaged in a sinking in late 1924, but was eventually raised, and returned to service for some time.  ''Relief'' was abandoned in 1931.\n\n== Route ==\n===Rapids and portages ===\nIn its natural state, the Columbia river had a [[List of rapids of the Columbia River|many rapids and narrows]] which impeded navigation.  Moving upstream, at [[river mile]] 146.5 were the [[Cascades Rapids]], which were impassable upstream.  Next came [[Celilo Falls]], also known as The Dalles, which were a series of rapids, eddies, and chutes running between river miles 188 and 200.  Between river mile 200 and the mouth of the [[Snake River]], at river mile 325,<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://columbiariverimages.com/Regions/Places/snake_river.html\n | title = Snake River, Washington\n | last = \n | first =\n | date =\n | website = Lewis and Clark\u2019s Columbia River\n | publisher =\n | access-date = 8 Apr 2020\n | quote= }}</ref> the Umatilla Rapids were the most significant barrier to steamboat navigation.\n\nThe river below the Cascades was called the Lower Columbia.  Between the Cascades and The Dalles was the Middle Columbia.  Upstream from The Dalles was called the Upper Columbia. Steamboats could not move upstream (except in rare cases by [[Lining (steamboat)|lining)]] through either Celilo Falls or the Cascades.  In favorable conditions, steamboats could be taken down through the rapids.<ref name = MillsChap6>{{cite book \n| author1-last = Mills \n| author1-first = Randall V. \n| author-link1 = Randall V.

In 1896 the [[Cascades Locks and Canal]] were completed, which effectively joined the lower and middle river for navigation.  The portage railroad around Celilo Falls remained the only way to move steamboat cargo from the upper to the lower Columbia.\n\n===Railroad competition===\nRailroads and steamboats often competed for business.
