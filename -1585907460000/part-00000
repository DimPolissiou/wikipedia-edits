In the [[1991 Nepalese legislative election|1991 election]], the [[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] became the third-largest party in the [[Parliament of Nepal|Nepali parliament]]. However, disagreements within the [[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] surged, regarding which tactics were to be used by the party. One group, led by [[Prachanda|Pushpa Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda)]], argued for immediate armed revolution, while the other group, led by Nirmal Lama, claimed that Nepal was not yet ripe for armed struggle.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|332}}\n\nOn 22 May 1994, the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre)|CPN(UC)]]/[[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] was split in two. The militant faction later renamed itself the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], or CPN(M). This faction described the government forces, mainstream political parties, and the monarchy, as \"[[feudal]] forces\". The armed struggle began on 13 February 1996, when the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|CPN(M)]] carried out 7 simultaneous attacks over 6 districts.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|333}} Initially, the Nepali government mobilized the [[Nepal Police]] to contain the insurgency. The [[Royal Nepal Army]] was not involved in direct fighting because the conflict was regarded as a policing matter. On Friday, 1 June 2001, there was a [[Nepalese royal massacre|massacre of the Nepalese royal family]] at the [[Narayanhiti Palace]] - the official residence of the [[Shah dynasty|House of Gorkha]], which was the royal house of Nepal at the time. Perpetrated by [[Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah|Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah]], the heir apparent to the Nepalese thrown, there were ten deaths and five injuries - four injured victims and one self-inflicted injury on Dipendra after firing the weapon that he was using upon himself in the head as an apparent attempt at committing [[suicide]]. Dipendra's attempt against his own life initially failed as he fell into a coma for three days before dying, during which he was crowned as the new Nepalese king. On 25 July 2001, the government of [[Sher Bahadur Deuba]] and the Maoist insurgents declared a [[ceasefire]], and held peace talks from August to November of that year.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|335}} The failure of these peace talks resulted in the return to armed conflict, beginning with the Maoist attack on an army [[barracks]] in [[Dang Deokhuri District|Dang District]] in western Nepal, on 22 November.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|335}} The situation changed dramatically in 2002, as the number of attacks by both sides increased greatly, and more people died than in any other year of the war.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|309}}\n\nThe government responded by banning anti-monarchy statements,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anti-king remarks intolerable: Lohani |publisher=NepalNews: The Kathmandu Post |date=20 December 2003 |url=http://www.nepalnews.com.np/contents/englishdaily/ktmpost/2003/dec/dec21/ |accessdate=22 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041114013039/http://www.nepalnews.com.np/contents/englishdaily/ktmpost/2003/dec/dec21/ |archivedate = 14 November 2004}}</ref> imprisoning journalists, and shutting down newspapers accused of siding with the insurgents. Several rounds of negotiations, accompanied by temporary ceasefires, were held between the insurgents and the government. The government categorically rejected the insurgents' demand for the [[constituent assembly]] elections. At the same time, the Maoists refused to recognize the continued survival of [[constitutional monarchy]]. In November 2004, the government rejected both the Maoists' request to negotiate directly with [[King Gyanendra]] rather than via Prime Minister [[Sher Bahadur Deuba|Deuba]], and the Maoists' request for discussions to be mediated by a third party such as the United Nations.\n\nThroughout the war, the government controlled the main cities and towns, whilst the Maoists dominated the rural areas.

The insurgency period is known as the '''Maovadi dwandakaal''' ({{lang-ne|\u092e\u093e\u0913\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0940 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0915\u093e\u0932}}) in Nepal.\n\nThe rebellion was launched by the CPN-M on 13 February 1996 with the stated purpose of overthrowing the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Nepalese monarchy]] and establishing a [[People's Republic]].

However, communist groups, uncomfortable with the alliance between the [[United Left Front (Nepal, 1990)|ULF]] and the [[Nepali Congress|Congress Party]], formed a parallel front, the [[United National People's Movement|United National People's Movement (UNPM)]]. The [[United National People's Movement|UNPM]] called for elections to a [[constituent assembly]], and rejected compromises made by [[United Left Front (Nepal, 1990)|ULF]] and the [[Nepali Congress|Congress Party]] with the royal house. In November 1990, the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre)]], or CPN(UC), was formed, and included key elements of the [[United National People's Movement|UNPM]].

In the [[1991 Nepalese legislative election|1991 election]], the [[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] became the third-largest party in the [[Parliament of Nepal|Nepali parliament]]. However, disagreements within the [[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] surged, regarding which tactics were to be used by the party. One group, led by [[Prachanda|Pushpa Kamal Dahal (alias Prachanda)]], argued for immediate armed revolution, while the other group, led by Nirmal Lama, claimed that Nepal was not yet ripe for armed struggle.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|332}}\n\nOn 22 May 1994, the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre)|CPN(UC)]]/[[United People's Front of Nepal|UPFN]] was split in two. The militant faction later renamed itself the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]], or CPN(M). This faction described the government forces, mainstream political parties, and the monarchy, as \"[[feudal]] forces\". The armed struggle began on 13 February 1996, when the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|CPN(M)]] carried out 7 simultaneous attacks over 6 districts.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|333}} Initially, the Nepali government mobilized the [[Nepal Police]] to contain the insurgency. The [[Royal Nepal Army]] was not involved in direct fighting because the conflict was regarded as a policing matter. On Friday, 01 June 2001, there was a [[Nepalese royal massacre|massacre of the Nepalese royal family]] at the [[Narayanhiti Palace]] - the official residence of the [[Shah dynasty|House of Gorkha]], which was the royal house of Nepal at the time. Perpetrated by [[Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah|Prince Dipendra Bir Bikram Shah]], the heir apparent to the Nepalese thrown, there were ten deaths and five injuries - four injured victims and one self-inflicted injury on Dipendra after firing the weapon that he was using upon himself in the head as an apparent attempt at committing [[suicide]]. Dipendra's attempt against his own life initially failed as he fell into a coma for three days before dying, during which he was crowned as the new Nepalese king. On 25 July 2001, the government of [[Sher Bahadur Deuba]] and the Maoist insurgents declared a [[ceasefire]], and held peace talks from August to November of that year.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|335}} The failure of these peace talks resulted in the return to armed conflict, beginning with the Maoist attack on an army [[barracks]] in [[Dang Deokhuri District|Dang District]] in western Nepal, on 22 November.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|335}} The situation changed dramatically in 2002, as the number of attacks by both sides increased greatly, and more people died than in any other year of the war.<ref name=\"Lawoti-Pahari\" />{{rp|309}}\n\nThe government responded by banning anti-monarchy statements,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anti-king remarks intolerable: Lohani |publisher=NepalNews: The Kathmandu Post |date=20 December 2003 |url=http://www.nepalnews.com.np/contents/englishdaily/ktmpost/2003/dec/dec21/ |accessdate=22 November 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041114013039/http://www.nepalnews.com.np/contents/englishdaily/ktmpost/2003/dec/dec21/ |archivedate = 14 November 2004}}</ref> imprisoning journalists, and shutting down newspapers accused of siding with the insurgents. Several rounds of negotiations, accompanied by temporary ceasefires, were held between the insurgents and the government. The government categorically rejected the insurgents' demand for the [[constituent assembly]] elections. At the same time, the Maoists refused to recognize the continued survival of [[constitutional monarchy]]. In November 2004, the government rejected both the Maoists' request to negotiate directly with [[King Gyanendra]] rather than via Prime Minister [[Sher Bahadur Deuba|Deuba]], and the Maoists' request for discussions to be mediated by a third party such as the United Nations.\n\nThroughout the war, the government controlled the main cities and towns, whilst the Maoists dominated the rural areas.

At first, the Madurai Saurashtra Sabha was formed in the year 1895 and it was formally registered in the year 1900 with many objectives. The formation of this Sabha was the first step towards [[social mobilization]]. The Sabha's administration is carried out by elected Councillors and office bearers. It has its own rules and regulations regarding holding of elections, rights and duties of office bearers and celebration of social functions. The election to the Sabha is held once in three years. The [[social]] life of the Saurashtrians is controlled almost wholly by the Saurashtra Sabha. This organisation is a committee of the leading men of the community, which manages and controls all the schools and public institutions, the [[temple]] and its worship, and all political, [[Religion|religious]], and social questions among the Saurashtrians.\n\nThe Saurashtra Madhya (central) Sabha, which has its headquarters at [[Madurai]] now remains as the cultural center for all the Saurashtrians living in [[Tamil Nadu]]. Many well-to-do [[Merchant|merchants]] and [[philanthropists]] of the community have contributed substantially to the growth of these institutions.
