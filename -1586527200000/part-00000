As with the title, the album heralds the end of the 'Nightmare' concept. This overarching theme the group has been promoting in their past title songs since their debut single 'Chase Me' has finally ended and culminated in their new single - 'PIRI', a song showcasing Dreamcatcher's signature rock acoustics and incorporation of music from its [[Piri|namesake musical instrument]]. On the same day, Dreamcatcher's agency, HappyFace Entertainment, also announced that they will henceforth be renamed as DreamCatcher Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=108&aid=0002761004|title=\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc720 \"\uc18c\uc18d\uc0ac \uc774\ub984, \ud574\ud53c\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\u2192\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \ucef4\ud37c\ub2c8\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\"|website=entertain.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter promotions of the new song 'PIRI', Dreamcatcher went on their Asia Tour 'Invitation from Nightmare City', which was announced to be held in several cities - Jakarta, Manila, Singapore, Seoul itself, as well as Japanese cities Tokyo and Kobe - from March to May 2019. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the concert stop in Jakarta was later canceled - instead, Dreamcatcher only stopped by in the city for a short fan-meeting.\n\nSubsequently, in July, 3 more stops were announced as part of the 'Invitation From Nightmare City' tour - Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, together with Kuala Lumpur city in Malaysia. Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September. Unfortunately, due to a fire occurring at 170 Russell theater on August 31, Dreamcatcher was forced to cancel their Melbourne stop one day before the concert was to be held.\n\nOn August 31, Dreamcatcher announced the official 1st generation membership for their fanclub 'INSOMNIA', which will confer fans various benefits and limited edition goods. Both Korean and Japanese fanclub applications started on September 2, and lasted for a month.\n\nOn September 2, a series of pictures titled 'Mystery Code #01' were posted onto Instagram, possibly teasing a new release. The next day, a new 'Mystery Code #02' was posted onto their Instagram, containing 2 photos and a video. Following that, a comeback scheduler was unveiled - confirming the release of a new special mini album, ''Raid of Dream.''\n\nOn September 11, the group released their first Japanese full album titled ''The Beginning of The End'', which includes Japanese versions of most of their title songs and 2 new Japanese singles. The music video for the track 'Breaking Out' was released 2 days prior to the album release, and Dreamcatcher held a showcase to promote and perform the new Japanese songs on September 14 - an event that was broadcast on [https://live.line.me/ LINE Live].\n\nTogether with the release of Dreamcatcher's Korean comeback album ''Raid of Dream'', the music video of their new Korean song 'Deja Vu' was unveiled on September 18 after a sequence of teasers and trailers. A Japanese version of the song was also uploaded simultaneously. This song is a formal collaboration with the mobile game '[[King's Raid]]'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bbs.ruliweb.com/news/531/read/127729|title=\uac8c\uc784\uc744 \uc544\uc774\ub3cc \ub178\ub798\ub85c \ub9cc\ub4e4\ub2e4, '\ud0b9\uc2a4\ub808\uc774\ub4dcX\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0' \uc568\ubc94 \uc1fc\ucf00\uc774\uc2a4|website=\ub8e8\ub9ac\uc6f9|language=ko|access-date=2019-09-22|date=2019-09-18}}</ref>\n\nAfter the conclusion of 'Deja Vu' promotions, Dreamcatcher embarked on their second Europe Tour, specifically in the cities of London (October 24), Milan (October 27), Berlin (October 30), Warsaw (November 1), Paris (November 3), Amsterdam (November 5), and lastly Helsinki (November 7).

As with the title, the album heralds the end of the 'Nightmare' concept. This overarching theme the group has been promoting in their past title songs since their debut single 'Chase Me' has finally ended and culminated in their new single - 'PIRI', a song showcasing Dreamcatcher's signature rock acoustics and incorporation of music from its [[Piri|namesake musical instrument]]. On the same day, Dreamcatcher's agency, HappyFace Entertainment, also announced that they will henceforth be renamed as DreamCatcher Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=108&aid=0002761004|title=\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc720 \"\uc18c\uc18d\uc0ac \uc774\ub984, \ud574\ud53c\ud398\uc774\uc2a4\u2192\ub4dc\ub9bc\uce90\uccd0 \ucef4\ud37c\ub2c8\ub85c \ubcc0\uacbd\"|website=entertain.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-02-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter promotions of the new song 'PIRI', Dreamcatcher went on their Asia Tour 'Invitation from Nightmare City', which was announced to be held in several cities - Jakarta, Manila, Singapore, Seoul itself, as well as Japanese cities Tokyo and Kobe - from March to May 2019. However, due to undisclosed reasons, the concert stop in Jakarta was later canceled - instead, Dreamcatcher only stopped by in the city for a short fan-meeting.\n\nSubsequently, in July, 3 more stops were announced as part of the 'Invitation From Nightmare City' tour - Australian cities Melbourne and Sydney, together with Kuala Lumpur city in Malaysia. Concerts at these 3 locations took place from late August to early September. Unfortunately, due to a fire occurring at 170 Russell theater on August 31, Dreamcatcher was forced to cancel their Melbourne stop one day before the concert was to be held.\n\nOn August 31, Dreamcatcher announced the official 1st generation membership for their fanclub 'INSOMNIA', which will confer fans various benefits and limited edition goods. Both Korean and Japanese fanclub applications started on September 2, and lasted for a month.\n\nOn September 2, a series of pictures titled 'Mystery Code #01' were posted onto Instagram, possibly teasing a new release. The next day, a new 'Mystery Code #02' was posted onto their Instagram, containing 2 photos and a video. Following that, a comeback scheduler was unveiled - confirming the release of a new special mini album, ''Raid of Dream.''\n\nOn September 11, the group released their first Japanese full album titled ''The Beginning of The End'', which includes Japanese versions of most of their title songs and 2 new Japanese singles.

On board were seven crew members \u2013 the largest flight crew ever to fly on a single spacecraft at that time. They included commander [[Robert L. Crippen]], making his fourth Shuttle flight and second in six months (Crippen became the first American astronaut to complete two space missions in the same calendar year); pilot [[Jon A. McBride]]; three mission specialists \u2013 [[David C. Leestma]], [[Sally Ride|Sally K. Ride]] and [[Kathryn D. Sullivan]] \u2013 and two payload specialists, [[Paul Scully-Power]] and [[Marc Garneau]], the first Canadian citizen to serve as a Shuttle crew member, as well as the first Canadian in space. The mission also marked the first time two female astronauts had flown together.\n\nSullivan became the first American woman to walk in space when she and Leestma performed a 3-hour [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] on 11 October, demonstrating the Orbital Refueling System (ORS) and proving the feasibility of refueling satellites in orbit.\n\nNine hours after liftoff, the {{convert|5087|lbs|kg}} [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS) was deployed from the payload bay by the [[Remote Manipulator System|RMS]] robot arm, and its on-board thrusters boosted it into orbit {{convert|350|mi|km}} above the Earth. ERBS was the first of three planned satellites designed to measure the amount of energy received from the [[Sun]] and reradiated into space. It also studied the seasonal movement of energy from the [[tropics]] to the [[polar region]]s.\n\nAnother major mission activity was the operation of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B). The SIR-B was part of the OSTA-3 experiment package in the payload bay, which also included the Large Format Camera (LFC) to photograph the Earth, another camera called [[MAPS (camera)|MAPS]] which measured air pollution, and a feature identification and location experiment called FILE, which consisted of two TV cameras and two 70&nbsp;mm still cameras.\n[[File:SIR-B Sudbury Impact Crater.jpg|left|thumb|Sample image taken using the SIR-B over Canada.]]\nThe SIR-B was an improved version of a similar device flown on the OSTA-1 package during [[STS-2]]. It had an eight-panel antenna array measuring 35 feet by 7 feet (11 m by 2 m). It operated throughout the flight, but problems were encountered with ''Challenger'''s [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]] antenna, and therefore much of the data had to be recorded on board the orbiter rather than transmitted to Earth in real-time as was originally planned.\n\nPayload Specialist Scully-Power, an employee of the [[U.S. Naval Research Lab]], performed a series of [[oceanography]] observations during the mission. Garneau conducted a series of experiments sponsored by the Canadian government, called CANEX, which were related to medical, atmospheric, climatic, materials and robotic science. A number of [[Getaway Special|GAS]] canisters, covering a wide variety of materials testing and physics experiments, were also flown.\n\nA claim was later made that the Soviet [[Terra-3]] laser testing center was used to track Challenger with a low-power [[laser]] on 10 October. This supposedly caused the malfunction of on-board equipment and the temporary blinding of the crew, leading to a U.S. diplomatic protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/news/russia/1996/druma189_s96005.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists \u2013 \"Silent Space Is Being Monitored\"|accessdate=11 December 2006|author=Lieutenant Colonel Boris Kononenko|date=June 1996}}</ref> However, this story has been comprehensively denied by the crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautinews.it/2015/02/15/intervista-esclusiva-allastronauta-jon-mcbride/|title=Intervista esclusiva all\u2019astronauta Jon McBride|accessdate=15 February 2015|author=Paolo Baldo|date=2009|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 8-day, 5-hour, 23-minute, 33-second mission, ''Challenger'' traveled {{convert|3289444|mi|km}} and completed 132 orbits. It landed at the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center \u2013 becoming the second shuttle mission to land there \u2013 on 13 October 1984, at 12:26&nbsp;pm EDT.<ref name=mis41g>{{cite web|url=https://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/41-g/mission-41-g.html|title=41-G (13)|publisher=NASA|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe STS-41-G mission was later described in detail in the book ''Oceans to Orbit: The Story of Australia's First Man in Space, Paul Scully-Power'' by space historian [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]].\n\n==Mission insignia==\nThe thirteen complete stars in the blue field of the [[Flag of the United States|U.S. flag]] of the mission insignia symbolize the flight's numerical designation in the Space Transportation System's mission sequence and being essentially the 13th undertaken flight, by 'obscuring' the remaining stars. (the 17 stars in the black field were indicative of the flight's original designation as STS-17) Central, as if it is launching, is an astronaut insignia in gold, which was presented to each astronaut since Mercury, after completing their first space flight, as a reference to the mostly rookie crew. Gender symbols are placed next to each astronaut's name (the male symbol was 'buffed up' as to make it feasible to visualize on the patch), and a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] icon is placed next to Garneau's name. Originally it was intended to have Sullivan's name be donned with an icon for the [[Flag of Australia|Australian flag]] in similar fashion. She reportedly declined, as she was only born there, and felt the connection not sufficiently meriting this honor.\n\n==Wake-up calls==\nNASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the [[Gemini program]], and first used music to wake up a flight crew during [[Apollo 15]]. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.<ref name=\"chronology\">\n{{cite news\n| first = Colin\n| last = Fries\n| title = Chronology of Wakeup Calls\n| date = 25 June 2007\n| publisher = NASA\n| url = https://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf\n| accessdate = 13 August 2007\n}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

On board were seven crew members \u2013 the largest flight crew ever to fly on a single spacecraft at that time. They included commander [[Robert L. Crippen]], making his fourth Shuttle flight and second in six months (Crippen became the first American astronaut to complete two space missions in the same calendar year); pilot [[Jon A. McBride]]; three mission specialists \u2013 [[David C. Leestma]], [[Sally Ride|Sally K. Ride]] and [[Kathryn D. Sullivan]] \u2013 and two payload specialists, [[Paul Scully-Power]] and [[Marc Garneau]], the first Canadian citizen to serve as a Shuttle crew member, as well as the first Canadian in space. The mission also marked the first time two female astronauts had flown together.\n\nSullivan became the first American woman to walk in space when she and Leestma performed a 3-hour [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] on 11 October, demonstrating the Orbital Refueling System (ORS) and proving the feasibility of refueling satellites in orbit.\n\nNine hours after liftoff, the {{convert|5087|lbs|kg}} [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS) was deployed from the payload bay by the [[Remote Manipulator System|RMS]] robot arm, and its on-board thrusters boosted it into orbit {{convert|350|mi|km}} above the Earth. ERBS was the first of three planned satellites designed to measure the amount of energy received from the [[Sun]] and reradiated into space. It also studied the seasonal movement of energy from the [[tropics]] to the [[polar region]]s.\n\nAnother major mission activity was the operation of the Shuttle Imaging Radar-B (SIR-B). The SIR-B was part of the OSTA-3 experiment package in the payload bay, which also included the Large Format Camera (LFC) to photograph the Earth, another camera called [[MAPS (camera)|MAPS]] which measured air pollution, and a feature identification and location experiment called FILE, which consisted of two TV cameras and two 70&nbsp;mm still cameras.\n[[File:SIR-B Sudbury Impact Crater.jpg|left|thumb|Sample image taken using the SIR-B over Canada.]]\nThe SIR-B was an improved version of a similar device flown on the OSTA-1 package during [[STS-2]]. It had an eight-panel antenna array measuring 35 feet by 7 feet (11 m by 2 m). It operated throughout the flight, but problems were encountered with ''Challenger'''s [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub> band]] antenna, and therefore much of the data had to be recorded on board the orbiter rather than transmitted to Earth in real-time as was originally planned.\n\nPayload Specialist Scully-Power, an employee of the [[U.S. Naval Research Lab]], performed a series of [[oceanography]] observations during the mission. Garneau conducted a series of experiments sponsored by the Canadian government, called CANEX, which were related to medical, atmospheric, climatic, materials and robotic science. A number of [[Getaway Special|GAS]] canisters, covering a wide variety of materials testing and physics experiments, were also flown.\n\nA claim was later made that the Soviet [[Terra-3]] laser testing center was used to track Challenger with a low-power [[laser]] on 10 October. This supposedly caused the malfunction of on-board equipment and the temporary blinding of the crew, leading to a U.S. diplomatic protest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/news/russia/1996/druma189_s96005.htm|title=Federation of American Scientists \u2013 \"Silent Space Is Being Monitored\"|accessdate=11 December 2006|author=Lieutenant Colonel Boris Kononenko|date=June 1996}}</ref> However, this story has been comprehensively denied by the crew members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautinews.it/2015/02/15/intervista-esclusiva-allastronauta-jon-mcbride/|title=Intervista esclusiva all\u2019astronauta Jon McBride|accessdate=15 February 2015|author=Paolo Baldo|date=2009|language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 8-day, 5-hour, 23-minute, 33-second mission, ''Challenger'' traveled {{convert|3289444|mi|km}} and completed 132 orbits.

(the 17 stars in the black field were indicative of the flight's original designation as STS-17) Central, as if it is launching, is an astronaut insignia in gold, which was presented to each astronaut since Mercury, after completing their first space flight, as a reference to the mostly rookie crew. Gender symbols are placed next to each astronaut's name (the male symbol was 'buffed up' as to make it feasible to visualize on the patch), and a [[Flag of Canada|Canadian flag]] icon is placed next to Garneau's name. Originally it was intended to have Sullivan's name be donned with an icon for the [[Flag of Australia|Australian flag]] in similar fashion. She reportedly declined, as she was only born there, and felt the connection not sufficiently meriting this honor.\n\n==Wake-up calls==\nNASA began a tradition of playing music to astronauts during the [[Gemini program]], and first used music to wake up a flight crew during [[Apollo 15]]. Each track is specially chosen, often by the astronauts' families, and usually has a special meaning to an individual member of the crew, or is applicable to their daily activities.<ref name=\"chronology\">\n{{cite news\n| first = Colin\n| last = Fries\n| title = Chronology of Wakeup Calls\n| date = 25 June 2007\n| publisher = NASA\n| url = https://history.nasa.gov/wakeup%20calls.pdf\n| accessdate = 13 August 2007\n}}\n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The Forester was one of the first emerging crossover SUVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/subaru/forester/ |title=Subaru Forester |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=August 11, 2010 |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> It was built in the style of a car, but had a taller stance, higher [[h-point]] seating, and an [[all-wheel drive]] drivetrain. Subaru advertising employed the slogan \"SUV tough, Car Easy\". It used the Impreza platform but with the larger 2.5-liter [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ25D|EJ25D]] four-cylinder [[boxer engine]] from the Subaru Outback, making {{convert|123|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|220|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000&nbsp;rpm.\n\nIn Japan, the Forester replaced the Subaru Impreza Gravel Express, known in the US as the '''[[Subaru Outback Sport]]'''. However, the Outback Sport remained in production for the U.S. market. The Forester appeared after the introduction of the [[Nissan Rasheen]] in Japan with a similar appearance, and the Forester's Japanese competitors include the [[Toyota RAV4]], [[Mitsubishi RVR]], and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]]. Due to the Forester's low center of gravity, it meets the United States federal safety standards for passenger vehicles, and does not require a \"risk of rollover\" warning label on the driver's visor. Size and price-wise, it fits between the shared Impreza platform, and the larger Legacy.\n\nThe automatic transmissions used on AWD equipped vehicles will normally send 60% of the engine's torque to the front wheels and 40% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate transfer [[clutch]]. When the transmission detects a speed difference between the front and rear axle sets, the transmission progressively sends power to the rear wheels. Under slip conditions it can achieve an equal split in front and rear axle speeds.<ref name=\"Auto World\">[http://www.subaru-global.com/tec_awd.html \"Symmetrical AWD\" SUBARU GLOBAL]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210212806/http://www.subaru-global.com/tec_awd.html |date=December 10, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWhen accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicle's weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in reverse or first gear, the transmission divides the torque 50/50 to both front and rear wheels. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. The transmission clutch does not simply divide torque, but instead monitors speed between the front and rear differentials. In essence, the transmission is set more aggressively close to this ratio|date=July 2010}}  The manual transmission cars are set up with a near 50/50 torque split as a base setting, and it varies from there. Essentially, the manual cars are set up with more bias towards the rear than the automatic cars.\n\nThe trim levels were the basic model \"L\" and the fully equipped \"S\" for the USA versions.\n\nForester L came with a high level of standard equipment, including ABS, air conditioning, power windows, power locks, cruise control, digital temperature gauge, multi-reflector halogen headlights, fog lights, roof rack, rear window defogger, trailer harness connector, reclining front bucket seats with adjustable lumbar support, tilt steering, tinted glass, AM/FM/cassette stereo with its antenna laminated in the left-rear quarter window. Notably new in 2001 were the three-point seatbelts for all five seating positions, including force limiters in front and height-adjustable shoulder belt anchors for front and rear outboard positions, plus rear seat headrests for all three seating positions.\n\nForester S adds a viscous limited-slip differential, rear disc brakes, 16 \u00d7 6.5-inch alloy wheels with 215/60R16 tires (the L uses 15 \u00d7 6-inch steel wheels), upgraded moquette upholstery, heated front seats with net storage pockets in back, dual vanity mirrors, heated sideview mirrors, heated windshield wipers, and keyless entry. New equipment for 2001 included Titanium pearl paint for the bumpers and cladding; six-disc in-dash CD sound system; leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and handbrake handle; variable intermittent wipers with de-icers and driver's side fin; and the five-spoke alloy wheels. Some models were equipped with the $1,000 optional premium package on the Forester S, including monotone paint (Sedona Red Pearl), power moonroof, front side-impact airbags, and gold accent wheels. Other options were the $800 automatic transmission, $39 chrome tailpipe cover and $183 auto-dimming rear-view mirror with compass, bringing the sticker price to $25,412 including $495 delivery (U.S. dollars quoted).\n\n===Australia===\nThere was a change in body styling for all 2001\u20132002 models, and the 2001/2002 GT spec also had a change in engine management and power output was increased from 125 to {{convert|130|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n*'''GX''' - naturally aspirated 2.0-liter [[Flat-four engine|flat-4]], {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}\n**Engine size 1,994 cc (2.0-liter)\n**Compression ratio 9.7:1\n**Dual range gearbox - [[manual transmission|manual]] only\n**Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) 10.7 seconds\n*'''Limited''' - naturally aspirated 2.0-liter flat-4, {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}\n**Engine size 1,994 cc (2.0-liter)\n**Compression ratio 9.7:1\n**Dual range gearbox - manual only\n**Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) 10.7 seconds\n*'''Special Edition''' - naturally aspirated 2.0-liter flat-4, {{convert|92|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}\n**Engine Size 1,994 cc (2.0-liter)\n**Compression Ratio 9.7:1\n**Dual range gearbox - manual only\n**Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) 10.7 seconds\n\n[[File:2000 Subaru Forester (SF5 MY00) GT wagon (2015-07-10) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Facelift Subaru Forester GT]]\n\n*'''GT''' (1997\u20132000) - turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-4, {{convert|125|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}\n*'''GT''' (2000\u20132003) - turbocharged 2.0-liter flat-4, {{convert|130|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}}\n**Engine size 1,994 cc (2.0-liter)\n**Turbo TF035\n**Compression ratio 8.5:1\n**Acceleration 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0-62&nbsp;mph) 10.1 seconds\n\n===United States===\nThe U.S. market was offered the car starting in 1997 with either the 2.5-liter DOHC ([[Model year|MY]]1998 only) or 2.5-liter SOHC naturally aspirated engine (no turbocharged engines).

The 2003 Forester features weight-saving refinements such as an aluminum hood, perforated rails, and a [[hydroforming|hydro-formed]] front [[sub-frame]]. The most noticeable change was the offering of 2.5 L versions (normally aspirated and turbocharged) and in the U.S. the introduction of the turbo charged 2.5-liter model.\n\nIn the U.S., the naturally aspirated (non-turbo) X (previously L) and XS (previously S) were released in 2003. In 2004, the turbocharged XT version was released. However, the same model had been available since the late 1990s elsewhere in the world. The X and XS models feature a 2.5&nbsp;L [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, while the XT model features a 2.5&nbsp;L turbocharged [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] engine. Both engines have [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven [[camshafts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samarins.com/reviews/forester.html |title=Subaru Forester 2003-2008 review|work=[[Samarins.com]]|access-date=April 3, 2009}}</ref> The XT model uses the same [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] TD04 turbocharger used in the [[Subaru Impreza WRX]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Those seeking additional power for their Forester XT can replace the turbocharger and intercooler with used STI components which are readily available. All Forester 2.5&nbsp;L engines are of the [[interference engine]] type.\n\nIn 2004, Subaru launched an STI variant of the Forester, the Forester STI, for the Japanese Market, sharing the same engine as the 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STI. Starting with the 2004 XT, the turbocharged version had active valve control system [[Active valve control system|AVCS]] cylinder heads. The i-AVLS active valve lift system became standard on the naturally aspirated version of the Forester in 2006. This increased horsepower and torque figures to 173 HP and 166&nbsp;ft-lbs. The 2006 XT received a higher compression ratio to 8.4:1 from 8.2:1. This increased the XT's power to 230 HP and 235&nbsp;ft-lbs.\n\nFor the 2006 model year, Subaru gave the SG a facelift, using redesigned headlights, tail-lights, bonnet, grille, front bumper and side-moldings.\n\n===Safety===\nMY03-04 Models has a 4-Star [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] safety rating. MY05 Forester Model had a mid-life update, which update increased its ANCAP safety rating to 5 Stars.\n\nIn 2006, the turbocharged engine (powering the Forester XT) was awarded [[International Engine of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukintpress.com/engineoftheyear/winners/2_25.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20060318013540/http://www.ukintpress.com/engineoftheyear/winners/2_25.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 18, 2006|title=International Engine of the Year Award - 2.0L to 2.5L category}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subaru.com.au/news/?newsid=12491|title=Subaru Australia's announcement of winning the International Engine of the Year award}}</ref> This engine is also used in the Subaru Impreza WRX, as well as the re-badged [[Saab 9-2X]]Aero.\n\n===Maintenance===\nAll of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines for this generation have a timing belt made of rubber and cord. A belt must be replaced at {{convert|105,000|mi|km}}. These engines are [[interference engines]], meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, it is a good idea to change the water pump, thermostat, belt tensioner and all the idler pulleys for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.\nIn Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the timing belt replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.\nThe 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this problem was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still a problem.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:06-08 Subaru Forester 2.5XT Sports.jpg|thumb|right|2006\u20132008 Subaru Forester XT Sports]]\nThe U.S. Market was offered the car with either the 2.5 SOHC naturally aspirated engine, or the 2.5 DOHC turbocharged version\nadded in 2004.\n\n2004 versions sold in the United States:\n* '''2.5 X''' - Base model, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L [[Flat-four engine|flat-4]], {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XS''' - Luxury model, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XS Premium''' - Luxury model with sunroof and leather seats, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L [[flat-4]], {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XT Turbo ''' - [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|210|hp|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XT Turbo Premium''' - Leather seats, sunroof, Automatic Transmission only, turbocharged 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|210|hp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nIn 2005, the L.L.

The Forester had not been rated Good in the Small Overlap Front test until modifications were made for the 2014 model year. The small overlap test, introduced in 2012 by the IIHS, simulates a frontal collision on 25 percent of the driver's side front corner. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles. Another small overlap test was conducted on a number of vehicles, including a 2014 Forester, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. The crash test showed substantially more intrusion into the passenger side than into the driver's side of the Forester, it would have been rated Marginal<ref>{{cite web|date=|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Vehicles with good driver-side protection may leave passengers at risk|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|access-date=}}</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/automobiles/risks-higher-for-front-seat-passengers-in-some-suv-crashes-tests-show.html</ref>\n\n===X Mode===\nThe 2014 Forester has a new feature called X Mode that allows owners to go through more extreme conditions both on the road and off. The concept is that any driver, regardless of skill level, can drive safely on wet roads or muddy areas. It works by monitoring wheel-slip on all four wheels; should one or more wheels begin to slip, X Mode kicks in and applies the brakes to the affected wheel which results in a transfer of power to the opposite wheel. After it is engaged by a simple push button, X Mode stays engaged up until the vehicle's speed is about {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} then disengages itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmFqfywu-OQ/ |title=Subaru Lab Episode 5 - X Mode |publisher=Byers Dublin Subaru.org |date=April 8, 2013|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===EyeSight Driver Assist System<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MMhN9B1Jos&feature=player_embedded/ |title=Subaru Eyesight Overview|publisher=Subaru.com |date=June 27, 2012}}</ref>===\n\nThe 2014 top-of-the-line Touring model Forester offers Subaru's EyeSight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/spotlight-on-subaru-eyesight.html/ |title=Spotlight On: Subaru Eyesight|publisher=leftlanenews.com |date=February 14, 2013 <!-- @11:45 am --> |access-date=}}</ref> driver assist technology that uses [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[CCD camera]]s mounted on either side of the rearview mirror.

The passenger seat is higher, the sound system has been upgraded, the rear bench seats are higher and the console is re-positioned for the person riding in the center.  The manual transmission models were also upgraded to a six-speed transmission instead of the previous generation's five-speed transmission. Engines during these year models do have an issue, this seems to be related predominantly to US manufactured vehicles and Subaru Australia have had no significant issues with excess oil consumption in Australia with the Japanese manufactured vehicles.(Source Subaru Australia and extensive research prior to purchase by Australian customer (KRH)){{original research inline|date=January 2019}} with oil consumption, along with numerous other automotive manufactures at the time. Subaru had its settlement of a lawsuit approved by a US Court in August 2016.<ref>https://www.classlawgroup.com/subaru-oil-consumption-class-action-lawsuit/</ref> The US complainants experienced over 1.5 quarts of oil consumed between change intervals with low-level dash lights coming on. The settlement provided for such complainants to receive an extended eight year warranty on the engine, allowing for an engine rebuild for that excessive oil consumption.

The trim level determines which system is installed. All provide a nominal torque split biased 60 front to 40 rear.\n\n* Base: Variable Torque Distribution (VTD) utilizing electronically controlled clutches to control torque split.\n* Premium: enhanced \u201cX-Mode\u201d which is a Single Mode System that optimizes engine output and transmission ratio. It enhances control of the VDC system to further control wheelspin and incorporates Hill Descent Control (HDC).\n* Sport, Limited and Touring: further enhanced \u201cDual Function X-Mode\u201d System that adds specific, user engaged, settings for Snow/Dirt and Deep Snow/Mud modes.\n\nFor the first time, all trim levels of Forester are only available with one engine: Subaru's new [[Subaru FB engine#FB25 DI|FB25 DI]]. The engine is a non-turbo, direct injection flat (boxer) 4 cylinder producing {{Convert|182|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm and {{Convert|176|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm.<ref name=features/> There is also only a single transmission option: the [[List of Subaru transmissions#Subaru Lineartronic CVT TR690 and TR580|Lineartronic CVT]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.subaru.com/build-your-own/2019/FOR.html |title=Choose Your 2019 Forester |publisher=Subaru of America |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nAll Foresters come standard with Subaru's Eyesight Driver Assistance Technology.<ref name=features>{{cite web |url=https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/forester/features.html |title=2019 Forester: Features |publisher=Subaru of America |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time Subaru DriverFocus\u2122 Distraction Mitigation System comes standard on the Touring trim, which provides an alert when it detects the driver is distracted or is drowsy. In addition, the DriverFocus system is able to recognize five different drivers and will set seat and mirror positions and climate control settings accordingly.<ref name=features/>\n\nIn 2019, the Start/Stop feature was added to all Forester models. This feature turns off the engine when the brake pedal is pressed. The engine restarts only after the gas pedal is pressed. This feature comes on by default every time the engine is turned on but may be disabled after the engine is on.\n\n===e-BOXER===\nSubaru introduced the e-BOXER hybrid powertrain for the European-market Forester and [[Subaru XV|XV]] at Geneva in March 2019; the e-BOXER integrates an electric motor into the Lineartronic CVT to improve fuel economy and increase power.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/press/news-en/2019_03_05_6990/ |title=Subaru unveiled European-spec \"e-BOXER\" equipped models at Geneva International Motor Show |date=March 5, 2019 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> The e-BOXER powertrain features a modified FB20 rated at {{convert|110|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600\u20136,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|194|Nm|lbft |abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000&nbsp;rpm.

The Forester was one of the first emerging crossover SUVs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edmunds.com/subaru/forester/ |title=Subaru Forester |publisher=Edmunds.com |date=August 11, 2010 |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref> It was built in the style of a car, but had a taller stance, higher [[h-point]] seating, and an [[all-wheel drive]] drivetrain. Subaru advertising employed the slogan \"SUV tough, Car Easy\". It used the Impreza platform but with the larger 2.5-liter [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ25D|EJ25D]] four-cylinder [[boxer engine]] from the Subaru Outback, making {{convert|123|kW|hp PS|0|abbr=on}} at 5,600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|220|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000&nbsp;rpm.\n\nIn Japan, the Forester replaced the Subaru Impreza Gravel Express, known in the US as the '''[[Subaru Outback Sport]]'''. However, the Outback Sport remained in production for the U.S. market. The Forester appeared after the introduction of the [[Nissan Rasheen]] in Japan with a similar appearance, and the Forester's Japanese competitors include the [[Toyota RAV4]], [[Mitsubishi RVR]], and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]]. Due to the Forester's low center of gravity, it meets the United States federal safety standards for passenger vehicles, and does not require a \"risk of rollover\" warning label on the driver's visor. Size and price-wise, it fits between the shared Impreza platform, and the larger Legacy.\n\nThe automatic transmissions used on AWD equipped vehicles will normally send 60% of the engine's torque to the front wheels and 40% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate transfer [[clutch]]. When the transmission detects a speed difference between the front and rear axle sets, the transmission progressively sends power to the rear wheels. Under slip conditions it can achieve an equal split in front and rear axle speeds.<ref name=\"Auto World\">[http://www.subaru-global.com/tec_awd.html \"Symmetrical AWD\" SUBARU GLOBAL]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210212806/http://www.subaru-global.com/tec_awd.html |date=December 10, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nWhen accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicle's weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing rear wheel traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in reverse or first gear, the transmission divides the torque 50/50 to both front and rear wheels. {{Citation needed|reason=please give a reliable source for this assertion. The transmission clutch does not simply divide torque, but instead monitors speed between the front and rear differentials. In essence, the transmission is set more aggressively close to this ratio|date=July 2010}}  The manual transmission cars are set up with a near 50/50 torque split as a base setting, and it varies from there. Essentially, the manual cars are set up with more bias towards the rear than the automatic cars.\n\nThe trim levels were the basic model \"L\" and the fully equipped \"S\" for the USA versions.\n\nForester L came with a high level of standard equipment, including ABS, air conditioning, power windows, power locks, cruise control, digital temperature gauge, multi-reflector halogen headlights, fog lights, roof rack, rear window defogger, trailer harness connector, reclining front bucket seats with adjustable lumbar support, tilt steering, tinted glass, AM/FM/cassette stereo with its antenna laminated in the left-rear quarter window. Notably new in 2001 were the three-point seatbelts for all five seating positions, including force limiters in front and height-adjustable shoulder belt anchors for front and rear outboard positions, plus rear seat headrests for all three seating positions.\n\nForester S adds a viscous limited-slip differential, rear disc brakes, 16 \u00d7 6.5-inch alloy wheels with 215/60R16 tires (the L uses 15 \u00d7 6-inch steel wheels), upgraded moquette upholstery, heated front seats with net storage pockets in back, dual vanity mirrors, heated sideview mirrors, heated windshield wipers, and keyless entry. New equipment for 2001 included Titanium pearl paint for the bumpers and cladding; six-disc in-dash CD sound system; leather-wrapped steering wheel, shift knob and handbrake handle; variable intermittent wipers with de-icers and driver's side fin; and the five-spoke alloy wheels.

The 2003 Forester features weight-saving refinements such as an aluminum hood, perforated rails, and a [[hydroforming|hydro-formed]] front [[sub-frame]]. The most noticeable change was the offering of 2.5 L versions (normally aspirated and turbocharged) and in the U.S. the introduction of the turbo charged 2.5-liter model.\n\nIn the U.S., the naturally aspirated (non-turbo) X (previously L) and XS (previously S) were released in 2003. In 2004, the turbocharged XT version was released. However, the same model had been available since the late 1990s elsewhere in the world. The X and XS models feature a 2.5&nbsp;L [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, while the XT model features a 2.5&nbsp;L turbocharged [[Overhead camshaft#Dual overhead camshaft|DOHC]] engine. Both engines have [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven [[camshafts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samarins.com/reviews/forester.html |title=Subaru Forester 2003-2008 review|work=[[Samarins.com]]|access-date=April 3, 2009}}</ref> The XT model uses the same [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] TD04 turbocharger used in the [[Subaru Impreza WRX]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Those seeking additional power for their Forester XT can replace the turbocharger and intercooler with used STI components which are readily available. All Forester 2.5&nbsp;L engines are of the [[interference engine]] type.\n\nIn 2004, Subaru launched an STI variant of the Forester, the Forester STI, for the Japanese Market, sharing the same engine as the 2005 Subaru Impreza WRX STI. Starting with the 2004 XT, the turbocharged version had active valve control system [[Active valve control system|AVCS]] cylinder heads. The i-AVLS active valve lift system became standard on the naturally aspirated version of the Forester in 2006. This increased horsepower and torque figures to 173 HP and 166&nbsp;ft-lbs. The 2006 XT received a higher compression ratio to 8.4:1 from 8.2:1. This increased the XT's power to 230 HP and 235&nbsp;ft-lbs.\n\nFor the 2006 model year, Subaru gave the SG a facelift, using redesigned headlights, tail-lights, bonnet, grille, front bumper and side-moldings.\n\n===Safety===\nMY03-04 Models has a 4-Star [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] safety rating. MY05 Forester Model had a mid-life update, which update increased its ANCAP safety rating to 5 Stars.\n\nIn 2006, the turbocharged engine (powering the Forester XT) was awarded [[International Engine of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukintpress.com/engineoftheyear/winners/2_25.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20060318013540/http://www.ukintpress.com/engineoftheyear/winners/2_25.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 18, 2006|title=International Engine of the Year Award - 2.0L to 2.5L category}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subaru.com.au/news/?newsid=12491|title=Subaru Australia's announcement of winning the International Engine of the Year award}}</ref> This engine is also used in the Subaru Impreza WRX, as well as the re-badged [[Saab 9-2X]]Aero.\n\n===Maintenance===\nAll of the 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engines for this generation have a timing belt made of rubber and cord. A belt must be replaced at {{convert|105,000|mi|km}}. These engines are [[interference engines]], meaning that if the timing belt breaks or stretches, the pistons will hit the valves, resulting in an engine teardown, and a likely rebuild. Also, if this belt is replaced around 105,000 miles, it is a good idea to change the water pump, thermostat, belt tensioner and all the idler pulleys for this belt. The water pump and thermostat are behind this belt.\nIn Australia for the Series II (MY06) cars, Subaru changed the recommended service interval for the timing belt replacement from 100,000 kilometers to 125,000 kilometers.\nThe 2.5-liter 4-cylinder engine in the first-generation Foresters featured head gaskets which were prone to premature failure. For 2003 and later, this problem was addressed with a revised, higher performing design, but is still a problem.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===United States===\n[[File:06-08 Subaru Forester 2.5XT Sports.jpg|thumb|right|2006\u20132008 Subaru Forester XT Sports]]\nThe U.S. Market was offered the car with either the 2.5 SOHC naturally aspirated engine, or the 2.5 DOHC turbocharged version\nadded in 2004.\n\n2004 versions sold in the United States:\n* '''2.5 X''' - Base model, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L [[Flat-four engine|flat-4]], {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XS''' - Luxury model, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XS Premium''' - Luxury model with sunroof and leather seats, with naturally aspirated 2.5&nbsp;L [[flat-4]], {{convert|165|hp|kW|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XT Turbo ''' - [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|210|hp|0|abbr=on}}\n* '''2.5 XT Turbo Premium''' - Leather seats, sunroof, Automatic Transmission only, turbocharged 2.5&nbsp;L flat-4, {{convert|210|hp|0|abbr=on}}\n\nIn 2005, the L.L.

The Forester had not been rated Good in the Small Overlap Front test until modifications were made for the 2014 model year. The small overlap test, introduced in 2012 by the IIHS, simulates a frontal collision on 25 percent of the driver's side front corner. Since its adoption, the IIHS has noticed several automakers making non-symmetrical modifications to their vehicles. Another small overlap test was conducted on a number of vehicles, including a 2014 Forester, but was conducted on the passenger side instead. The crash test showed substantially more intrusion into the passenger side than into the driver's side of the Forester, it would have been rated Marginal<ref>{{cite web|date=|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/vehicles-with-good-driver-side-protection-may-leave-passengers-at-risk|title=Vehicles with good driver-side protection may leave passengers at risk|publisher=Insurance Institute for Highway Safety|access-date=}}</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/automobiles/risks-higher-for-front-seat-passengers-in-some-suv-crashes-tests-show.html</ref>\n\n===X Mode===\nThe 2014 Forester has a new feature called X Mode that allows owners to go through more extreme conditions both on the road and off. The concept is that any driver, regardless of skill level, can drive safely on wet roads or muddy areas. It works by monitoring wheel-slip on all four wheels; should one or more wheels begin to slip, X Mode kicks in and applies the brakes to the affected wheel which results in a transfer of power to the opposite wheel. After it is engaged by a simple push button, X Mode stays engaged up until the vehicle's speed is about {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} then disengages itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmFqfywu-OQ/ |title=Subaru Lab Episode 5 - X Mode |publisher=Byers Dublin Subaru.org |date=April 8, 2013|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===EyeSight Driver Assist System<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MMhN9B1Jos&feature=player_embedded/ |title=Subaru Eyesight Overview|publisher=Subaru.com |date=June 27, 2012}}</ref>===\n\nThe 2014 top-of-the-line Touring model Forester offers Subaru's EyeSight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leftlanenews.com/spotlight-on-subaru-eyesight.html/ |title=Spotlight On: Subaru Eyesight|publisher=leftlanenews.com |date=February 14, 2013 <!-- @11:45 am --> |access-date=}}</ref> driver assist technology that uses [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] [[CCD camera]]s mounted on either side of the rearview mirror.

The passenger seat is higher, the sound system has been upgraded, the rear bench seats are higher and the console is re-positioned for the person riding in the center.  The manual transmission models were also upgraded to a six-speed transmission instead of the previous generation's five-speed transmission. Engines during these year models do have an issue, this seems to be related predominantly to US manufactured vehicles and Subaru Australia have had no significant issues with excess oil consumption in Australia with the Japanese manufactured vehicles.(Source Subaru Australia and extensive research prior to purchase by Australian customer (KRH)){{original research inline|date=January 2019}} with oil consumption, along with numerous other automotive manufactures at the time. Subaru had its settlement of a lawsuit approved by a US Court in August 2016.<ref>https://www.classlawgroup.com/subaru-oil-consumption-class-action-lawsuit/</ref> The US complainants experienced over 1.5 quarts of oil consumed between change intervals with low-level dash lights coming on. The settlement provided for such complainants to receive an extended eight year warranty on the engine, allowing for an engine rebuild for that excessive oil consumption.   Some speculation on this is the use of different style piston rings on the engine style change and synthetic oil.{{According to whom|date=March 2017}}\n\n'''Pre-facelift styling'''\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"2\">\nFile:2014 Subaru Forester XC Boxer Diesel Symmetrical 2.5 Front.jpg|Front (2.5)\nFile:2014 Subaru Forester XC Boxer Diesel Symmetrical 2.5 Rear.jpg|Rear (2.5)\n</gallery>\n'''Post-facelift styling''' (2017\u20132018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/2017-subaru-forester-gets-minor-updates-news |title=2017 Subaru Forester Gets Minor Updates &#8211; News &#8211; Car and Driver |publisher=Caranddriver.com |date=2016-04-14 |accessdate=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:2016 Subaru Forester XE Premium Symmetrical AWD facelift 2.0.jpg|Front (2.0i Premium)\nSubaru Forester 2.0i-L EyeSight X-BREAK SJ5 Rear.jpg|Rear (2.0i-L EyeSight X-BREAK)\n</gallery>\n\n=={{anchor|SK|fifth}} Fifth generation (SK, 2018-present)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Fifth generation\n| image        = 2019 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium, front 10.6.19.jpg\n| also called  = \n| production   = 2018\u2013present\n| engine       = {{ubl\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Subaru FB engine#FB20|''FB20'']] [[Flat-four engine|H4]]\n  | 2.5&nbsp;L [[Subaru FB engine#FB25 DI|''FB25 DI'']] H4\n  | 2.0&nbsp;L [[Subaru FB engine#FB20D e-Boxer|''FB20D e-Boxer'']] Hybrid H4\n  }}\n| transmission = [[List of Subaru transmissions#Subaru Lineartronic CVT TR690 and TR580|Lineartronic CVT]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length       = {{convert|4625|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width        = {{convert|1815|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight       = {{convert|3449|to|3588|lb|kg||abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height       = {{convert|1730|mm|in|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/download.do?id=1327|title=2019 Forester Specifications|author=|date=|work=US Media Center|access-date=January 10, 2019}}</ref><ref name=MY19-PR/>\n}}\nThe 2019 Subaru Forester was revealed on March 28, 2018 at the [[New York International Auto Show#2018|New York International Auto Show]].<ref name=MY19-PR>{{cite press release |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/press/news-en/2018_03_29_5579/ |title=World Premier of All-New 2019 Forester at New York International Auto Show |date=March 29, 2018 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Like contemporary Subaru models, the 2019 model year moved the Forester to the Subaru Global Platform.\n\nIn the US market, the 2019 Subaru Forester is available in the following trims:\n\n*Forester\n*Forester Premium\n*Forester Sport\n*Forester Limited\n*Forester Touring\n\nAs with all auto makers, each trim comes with a different level of standard features.

All provide a nominal torque split biased 60 front to 40 rear.\n\n* Base: Variable Torque Distribution (VTD) utilizing electronically controlled clutches to control torque split.\n* Premium: enhanced \u201cX-Mode\u201d which is a Single Mode System that optimizes engine output and transmission ratio. It enhances control of the VDC system to further control wheelspin and incorporates Hill Descent Control (HDC).\n* Sport, Limited and Touring: further enhanced \u201cDual Function X-Mode\u201d System that adds specific, user engaged, settings for Snow/Dirt and Deep Snow/Mud modes.\n\nFor the first time, all trim levels of Forester are only available with one engine: Subaru's new [[Subaru FB engine#FB25 DI|FB25 DI]]. The engine is a non-turbo, direct injection flat (boxer) 4 cylinder producing {{Convert|182|hp|0|abbr=on}} at 5800 rpm and {{Convert|176|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm.<ref name=features/> There is also only a single transmission option: the [[List of Subaru transmissions#Subaru Lineartronic CVT TR690 and TR580|Lineartronic CVT]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.subaru.com/build-your-own/2019/FOR.html |title=Choose Your 2019 Forester |publisher=Subaru of America |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nAll Foresters come standard with Subaru's Eyesight Driver Assistance Technology.<ref name=features>{{cite web |url=https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/forester/features.html |title=2019 Forester: Features |publisher=Subaru of America |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time Subaru DriverFocus\u2122 Distraction Mitigation System comes standard on the Touring trim, which provides an alert when it detects the driver is distracted or is drowsy. In addition, the DriverFocus system is able to recognize five different drivers and will set seat and mirror positions and climate control settings accordingly.<ref name=features/>\n\nIn 2019, the Start/Stop feature was added to all Forester models. This feature turns off the engine when the brake pedal is pressed. The engine restarts only after the gas pedal is pressed. This feature comes on by default every time the engine is turned on but may be disabled after the engine is on.\n\n===e-BOXER===\nSubaru introduced the e-BOXER hybrid powertrain for the European-market Forester and [[Subaru XV|XV]] at Geneva in March 2019; the e-BOXER integrates an electric motor into the Lineartronic CVT to improve fuel economy and increase power.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.subaru.co.jp/press/news-en/2019_03_05_6990/ |title=Subaru unveiled European-spec \"e-BOXER\" equipped models at Geneva International Motor Show |date=March 5, 2019 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> The e-BOXER powertrain features a modified FB20 rated at {{convert|110|kW|hp PS|abbr=on|0}} at 5,600\u20136,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|194|Nm|lbft |abbr=on}} of torque at 4,000&nbsp;rpm.

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] first-hand, Thompson was a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Murison, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} Thompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|first class honours]] in [[classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an [[exchange student]] in [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first-hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. He recalled having witnessed the smashing of a jeweler's shop by a Nazi mob.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}} These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future cautious approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterize his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin. Although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]] in 1941 through the help of his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}} From Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved again in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where he worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar in the United Kingdom in the field.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}} At Nottingham, Thompson focused mainly on research and teaching rather than administrative work.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Thompson sought to approach the subject without ideological ballast.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism probably influenced his research of this field.{{sfn|Markus|2001|pp=680-681}} His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation. He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} \n\nThompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society through its encounter with [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's reliance on primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, distinguished him from many more recent historians, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations...

After his retirement Thompson spent a year at the [[University of Wisconsin]], during which he produced four major papers which were later printed in the collection ''Romans and Barbarians: the Decline of the Western Empire'' (1982). Thompson subsequently shifted his focus to the end of [[Roman Britain]], on which he published the monographs ''Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain'' (1984) and ''Who was Saint Patrick?'' (1985). Thompson died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is present in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]].

He was Professor and Director of the Classics Department at the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1948 to 1979.\n\nThompson was a pioneer in the study of [[Late Antiquity]], and was for decades the most prominent British scholar in this field. Drawing upon a massive amount of research, Thompson revitalized [[English language|English-language]] scholarship on the history of early [[Germanic peoples]]. Having experienced the barbarity of [[Nazism]] first-hand, Thompson was a [[Marxism|Marxist]], and worked towards detaching the study of Germanic peoples from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past. \n\n==Early life==\nEdward Arthur Thompson was born on 22 May 1914 in the town of [[Waterford]], Ireland to a strictly [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} His father, Robert James Thompson, who was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent, worked for the [[National Health Insurance]]. His mother, Margaret Murison, was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=679}} Thompson graduated from [[The High School, Dublin]], and then entered [[Trinity College Dublin]] with a [[sizar]]ship, a distinction he shared with [[Jonathan Swift]]. He was the first of his family to enter university.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}  Thompson graduated with [[First-class honours|first class honours]] in [[classics]] from Trinity College in 1936, later attributing his selection of the classics as a discipline to the choice of his headmaster at The High School.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}\n\nFrom 1937\u20131938, Thompson was an [[exchange student]] in [[Berlin]]. While in Germany, Thompson experienced at first hand the barbarism of [[Nazism]]. He recalled having witnessed the smashing of a jeweler's shop by a Nazi mob.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}} These experiences had a major influence on Thompson's future cautious approach to the study of [[Germanic peoples]], which was to characterize his approach to this subject.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=680}}{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|right|upright=1|thumb|Distribution of the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] (700 AD), which was the subject of numerous studies by Thompson]]\nThompson's first appointment in [[academia]], as lecturer in classics, was a two-year stint at Trinity College Dublin. Although initially appointed for one year, Thompson's contract was renewed, and he stayed on (though at a reduced salary) until 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}}\n\nAlready prepared to enter [[World War II]] with an enlistment in the [[British Army]], Thompson secured an appointment at the [[University of Swansea]] in 1941 through the help of his friend [[Benjamin Farrington]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=681}} From Swansea, Thompson transferred to [[King's College, London]], teaching as a classics lecturer from 1945 to 1948. It was during this time that Thompson's first books, ''[[Ammianus Marcellinus]]'' (1947), and ''A History of Attila and the Huns'' (1948). Both were later reprinted.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Career at the University of Nottingham==\nThompson moved again in 1948{{spaced ndash}}this time to direct the classics department at the [[University of Nottingham]], where he worked from 1948 to 1979.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} During this time, Thompson contributed to the increasing quality of studies of Late Antiquity in the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=684}} He was considered the leading scholar in the United Kingdom in the field.{{sfn|Markus|1994}}{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}} At Nottingham, Thompson focused mainly on research and teaching rather than administrative work.{{sfn|Todd|2004}}\n\nBy the early 1950s, Thompson's research was increasingly focused on the early Germanic peoples. At this time, very little research had been carried out in this field in the English-speaking world. Thompson sought to approach the subject without ideological ballast.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}} Nevertheless, his revulsion towards Nazism probably influenced his research of this field.{{sfn|Markus|2001|pp=680-681}} His works were pioneering in the field of Germanic studies,{{sfn|Todd|2004}} in which he was the leading scholar of his generation. He helped detach the field from the ideological bias which had characterized it in the past.{{sfn|The Guardian. 31 January 1994}} \n\nThompson published his work ''The Early Germans'' in 1965, which was largely concerned with the changing structure of Germanic society through its encounter with [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=687}} His works on early Germanic peoples, such as the [[Visigoths]], quickly became standard reference works on the subject, and were still considered unsurpassed at the time of his death.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}} Thompson's reliance on primary sources to examine the past, and his attempts to establish clarity in the field, distinguished him from many more recent historians, who are heavily influenced by [[critical theory]] and consider primary sources unreliable.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=692}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = Edward Thompson... was the leading scholar of his generation on the history of the Germanic migrations...

After his retirement Thompson spent a year at the [[University of Wisconsin]], during which he produced four major papers which were later printed in the collection ''Romans and Barbarians: the Decline of the Western Empire'' (1982). Thompson subsequently shifted his focus to the end of [[Roman Britain]], on which he published the monographs ''Saint Germanus of Auxerre and the End of Roman Britain'' (1984) and ''Who was Saint Patrick?'' (1985). Thompson died in Nottingham on 1 January 1994.{{sfn|The Times. 2 February 1994}}\n\n==Politics==\nThompson's revulsion towards Nazism, and his rejection of the strict Presbyterianism of his family, made him receptive towards Marxist ideology, which was popular among intellectuals in the 1930s. He was particularly impressed by the works of [[Friedrich Engels]]. Influenced by Benjamin Farrington, Thompson joined the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] by 1941.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=682}} The influence of Marxism is present in Thompson's works on a wide variety of subjects.{{sfn|Markus|2001|p=686}}\n\nThompson left the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1956, the year of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet Union's intervention in Hungary]].

It was developed by [[Larry Gelbart]] as the first original spin-off series adapted from the 1970 feature film ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', which, in turn, was based on [[Richard Hooker (author)|Richard Hooker]]'s 1968 novel ''[[MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors]]''. The series, which was produced with [[20th Century Fox Television]] (currently part of [[Walt Disney Television|Disney Television Studios]]) for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \"4077th [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]\" in [[Uijeongbu]], [[South Korea]], during the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353). The show's [[title sequence]] features an instrumental-only version of \"[[Suicide Is Painless]],\" the original film's theme song. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, ''[[M*A*S*H Goes to Maine]]'', failed. The television series is the best-known of the ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' works, and one of the highest-rated shows in [[Television in the United States|U.S. television history]].\n\n== Plot ==\n''M*A*S*H'' aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour in length. The series is usually categorized as a [[situation comedy]], though it has also been described as a \"[[black comedy|dark comedy]]\" or a \"[[comedy-drama|dramedy]]\" because of the often dramatic subject matter.{{efn-ua|The term \"dramedy\" (drama + comedy), although coined in 1978, was not in common usage until after ''M*A*S*H'' had gone off the air.}}\n\nThe show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a [[United States Army]] ''[[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]'' (MASH) in the Korean War (1950\u201353). (The [[asterisk]]s in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie.){{clarify|date=July 2017}} The \"4077th MASH\" was one of several surgical units in Korea.\n\nWhile the show is traditionally viewed as a comedy, many episodes had a more serious tone. Early seasons aired on network prime time while the [[Vietnam War]] was still going on; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.\n\nEpisodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the civilian draftees of 4077th&nbsp;\u2013 Hawkeye, Trapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example&nbsp;\u2013 who are forced to leave their homes to tend the wounded and dying of the war, and the \"regular Army\" characters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who tend to represent patriotism and duty (though Houlihan and Potter could also represent the other perspective at times). Other characters, such as Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Cpl. Klinger, help demonstrate various American civilian attitudes toward Army life, while guest characters played by such actors as [[Eldon Quick]], [[Herb Voland]], [[Mary Wickes]], and [[Tim O'Connor (actor)|Tim O'Connor]] also help further the show's discussion of America's place as Cold War war maker and peace maker.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main cast===\n{{Main|List of M*A*S*H characters}}\n{{See also|List of M*A*S*H cast members}}\nThrough changes of personnel ''M*A*S*H'' maintained a relatively constant [[ensemble cast]], with four characters \u2013 [[Hawkeye Pierce|Hawkeye]], [[Father Mulcahy]], [[Margaret Houlihan]], and [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Maxwell Klinger|Maxwell Klinger]] \u2013 on the show for all 11 seasons. Several other main characters departed or joined the program during its run, and numerous guest actors and recurring characters were used. The writers found creating so many names difficult, and used names from elsewhere; for example, characters on [[List of M*A*S*H episodes (season 7)|the seventh season]] were named after the [[1978 Los Angeles Dodgers season|1978 Los Angeles Dodgers]].<ref name=\"levine20110130\">{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Ken|title=Naming characters on TV shows|url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2011/01/one-of-hardest-tasks-in-any-script-is.html|accessdate=2011-01-30|newspaper=kenlevine.blogspot.com|date=2011-01-30}}</ref>\n* Note: Character appearances include double-length episodes as two appearances, making 260 in total.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This was a result of changes in writing and production staff, rather than the cast defections of McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary Burghoff. Series co-creator and joke writer [[Larry Gelbart]] departed after Season 4, the first featuring Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan. This resulted in Farrell and Morgan having only a single season reading scripts featuring Gelbart's comic timing, which defined the feel and rhythm of Seasons 1\u20134 featuring predecessors Rogers and Stevenson, respectively. [[Larry Linville]] (the show's [[comic foil]]) and Executive Producer [[Gene Reynolds]] both departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in ''M*A*S*H'' being fully stripped of its original comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6 \u2014 the debut of the Charles Winchester era.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nWhereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of ''M*A*S*H'' for the show's first five seasons (1972\u20131977), [[Alan Alda]] and newly promoted Executive Producer [[Burt Metcalfe]] became the new dramatic voice of ''M*A*S*H'' for Seasons 6\u201311. By the start of Season 8 (1979\u20131980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of Gary Burghoff, ''M*A*S*H'' displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously moving between comedy and drama.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several episodes experimented by going outside the sitcom format:\n* \"Point of View\" \u2013 shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound\n* \"Dreams\" \u2013 an idea of Alda's, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams\n* \"A War For All Seasons\" \u2013 features a story line that takes place over the course of 1951\n* \"Life Time\" \u2013 a precursor to the American television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]],'' it utilizes the [[real time (media)|real time]] method of narration<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nAnother change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as [[McCarthyism|the McCarthy era]], various sporting events, and the stardom of [[Marilyn Monroe]] were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nWhile the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt \"the cracks were starting to show\" by season 9 (1980\u20131981).<ref name=\"book of MASH\">{{cite book| last = Kalter| first = Suzy | authorlink = | title = The Complete Book of M*A*S*H| publisher = Abradale Press, Harry M.

In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a 2-1/2 hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode produced was the penultimately aired episode \"As Time Goes By\". The series finale movie, titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched U.S. television broadcast]] in history at that time, with 106 million viewers.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\n===Set location===\n[[File:MASH site - Malibu Creek State Park - 2 January 2010.jpg|thumb|M*A*S*H site in Malibu Creek State Park. Hulk of a Dodge WC54 ambulance. Copy of the original M*A*S*H signpost was installed on the site in 2008.]]\nThe 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu ([[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], Los Angeles County, California) was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same set used to shoot the movie, although there were changes made to the positions of several tents for the TV show. The indoor set, on a sound stage at Fox Studios in [[Century City, California|Century City]], was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the \"outdoor\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the chopper pad required using the ranch).\n\nJust as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode as a forest fire caused by enemy [[incendiary bomb]]s that forced the 4077th to bug out.\n\nThe Malibu location is today known as [[Malibu Creek State Park]]. Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted [[Jeep]] and a [[Dodge]] ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.\n\nOn February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and ''M*A*S*H'' director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1941) and the ''[[Planet of the Apes (TV series)|Planet of the Apes]]'' television series (1974) were filmed, among many other productions. Much of this location, including the signpost and markers, was thought to have been destroyed in the 2018 [[Woolsey Fire]]<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-monica-mountains-20181111-story.html Woolsey fire destroys historic ranches, movie sets and open spaces in Santa Monica Mountains] Retrieved November 11, 2018</ref> but subsequently was determined to have survived the fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conejovalleyguide.com/welcome/mash-set-at-malibu-creek-state-park-survives-the-woolsey-fire|title=MASH Set at Malibu Creek State Park Survives the Woolsey Fire|website=Conejo Valley Guide {{!}} Conejo Valley Events|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Smithsonian exhibit===\n[[File:MASH Operating Room in the National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|right|The operating room set on display in the [[National Museum of American History]] as part of the \"MASH: Binding Up the Wounds\" exhibit in 1983.]]\nThe exhibit ''M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds'' was at the [[National Museum of American History]] from July 30, 1983 through February 3, 1985.

A different innovation was based on the show's producers' desire not to have a [[laugh track]], contrary to the network's desire to have one. They compromised by omitting laughter in the scenes set in the operating room. The DVD releases of the series allow viewers to select an audio version with no laugh track.\n\nIn his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking \"notes\" on a script,  his writing partner and he changed the script to a \"cold show\" \u2013 one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared {{convert|100|F}}. Levine says, \"This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Emerson Winchester |url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2007/10/charles-emerson-winchester.html |website=... by Ken Levine |author=Ken Levine |date=October 18, 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Jackie Cooper]] wrote that Alan Alda, whom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons, concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended.<ref>Jackie Cooper, ''Please Don't Shoot My Dog'', p. 290, William Morrow & Company, 1981</ref>\n\n===Vehicles===\nThe helicopters used on the series were model [[H-13 Sioux]] (military designation and nickname of the [[Bell 47]] civilian model). As in the film, some care seems to have been taken to use the correct model of the long-lived [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] 47 series. In the opening credits and many of the episodes, Korean War-vintage H-13Ds and Es (Bell 47D-1s) were used complete with period-correct external [[Litter (rescue basket)|litters]]. A later (1954\u201373) 47G occasionally made an appearance. The helicopters are similar in appearance (with the later \"G\" models having larger two-piece fuel tanks, a slightly revised cabin, and other changes) with differences noticeable only to a serious helicopter fan. In the pilot episode, a later Bell 47J (production began in 1957) was shown flying Henry Blake to Seoul, en route to a meeting with General Hammond in Tokyo.<ref>Day, Dwayne A. \"[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/MASH/HE12.htm MASH/Medevac Helicopters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119001032/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/MASH/HE12.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}.\" ''Centennial of Flight,'' April 18, 2008.</ref> A [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Sud Aviation Allouette II]] helicopter was also shown transporting Henry Blake to the 4077th in the episode \"Henry, Please Come Home\".\n\nThe [[Jeep]]s used were 1953 military M38 or civil CJ2A [[Willys]] Jeeps and also World War II Ford GPWs and Willys MB's. Two episodes featured the M38A1 Jeep, one of which was stolen from a General by Radar and Hawkeye after their Jeep was stolen. Two of the ambulances were [[WC-54]] Dodges and one was a [[Dodge WC series|WC-27]]. A WC-54 ambulance remains at the site and was burned in the Malibu fires on October 9, 1982, while a second WC-27 survives at a South El Monte museum without any markings. The bus used to transport the wounded was a 1954 [[Ford]] model. In the last season, an M43 ambulance from the Korean War era also was used in conjunction with the WC-54s and WC-27.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bell 47G-MASH.jpg|Bell 47G helicopter in MASH colours.\nFile:Mashdodge.jpg|Burned Dodge ambulance at Malibu Creek State Park\n\nFile:Mashjeep.jpg|Burned Jeep (most likely a CJ-2A) at Malibu Creek State Park\n</gallery>\n\n===Laugh track===\nSeries creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted ''M*A*S*H'' broadcast without a [[laugh track]]. Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. \"We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,\" said Gelbart in 1998. \"It's hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody's guts being sewn up.\"<ref>{{cite AV media| people = [[Larry Gelbart|Gelbart, Larry]] | title = Emmy TV Legends: Larry Gelbart Interview | medium = Interview with Dan Harrison | publisher = Archive for American Television | location = [[Los Angeles, California]] | date = May 26, 1998 | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/larry-gelbart}}</ref>\n\nSeasons 1\u20135 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6\u201311 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy-drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\"O.R.\",d \"The Bus\", \"[[Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?]]\", \"[[The Interview (M*A*S*H)|The Interview]]\", \"Point of View\", and \"[[Dreams (M*A*S*H)|Dreams]]\" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \"[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]\".<ref name=gelbart/> The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the \"technical difficulty\" was later released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown without the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating \"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like ''M*A*S*H'', it's downright unbearable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myreviewer.com/Review_of_MASH_Season_3_DVD_Review/a57838/page2 |title=Myreviewer.com/Review of MASH Season 3 DVD Review |publisher=Myreviewer.com |date=2004-03-20 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nOn all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/mash3.shtml |title=DVD Review: M*A*S*H \u2013 Season Three (Collector's Edition) |publisher=AVRev.com |date=2003-02-18 |accessdate=2011-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103002343/http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/mash3.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/reviews/review.asp?Index=4536&User=35366 |title=Another MASH DVD review mentioning audio choices |publisher=Dvd.reviewer.co.uk |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\n\"They're a lie,\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \"You're telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\" continued Gelbart. \"But our show was a film show \u2013 supposedly shot in the middle of [[Korea]]. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\" Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. \"So you know what they said?\" Gelbart said. \"'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!'

It was developed by [[Larry Gelbart]] as the first original spin-off series adapted from the 1970 feature film ''[[MASH (film)|M*A*S*H]]'', which, in turn, was based on [[Richard Hooker (author)|Richard Hooker]]'s 1968 novel ''[[MASH: A Novel About Three Army Doctors]]''. The series, which was produced with [[20th Century Fox Television]] (currently part of [[Walt Disney Television|Disney Television Studios]]) for CBS, follows a team of doctors and support staff stationed at the \"4077th [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]\" in [[Uijeongbu]], [[South Korea]], during the [[Korean War]] (1950\u201353). The show's [[title sequence]] features an instrumental-only version of \"[[Suicide Is Painless]],\" the original film's theme song. The show was created after an attempt to film the original book's sequel, ''[[M*A*S*H Goes to Maine]]'', failed. The television series is the best-known of the ''[[M*A*S*H]]'' works, and one of the highest-rated shows in [[Television in the United States|U.S. television history]].\n\n== Plot ==\n''M*A*S*H'' aired weekly on CBS, with most episodes being a half-hour in length. The series is usually categorized as a [[situation comedy]], though it has also been described as a \"[[black comedy|dark comedy]]\" or a \"[[comedy-drama|dramedy]]\" because of the often dramatic subject matter.{{efn-ua|The term \"dramedy\" (drama + comedy), although coined in 1978, was not in common usage until after ''M*A*S*H'' had gone off the air.}}\n\nThe show is an ensemble piece revolving around key personnel in a [[United States Army]] ''[[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]'' (MASH) in the Korean War (1950\u201353). (The [[asterisk]]s in the name are not part of military nomenclature and were creatively introduced in the novel and used in only the posters for the movie version, not the actual movie.){{clarify|date=July 2017}} The \"4077th MASH\" was one of several surgical units in Korea.\n\nWhile the show is traditionally viewed as a comedy, many episodes had a more serious tone. Early seasons aired on network prime time while the [[Vietnam War]] was still going on; the show was forced to walk the fine line of commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest against it. For this reason, the show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.\n\nEpisodes were both plot- and character-driven, with several narrated by one of the show's characters as the contents of a letter home. The show's tone could move from silly to sobering from one episode to the next, with dramatic tension often occurring between the civilian draftees of 4077th&nbsp;\u2013 Hawkeye, Trapper John, and B.J. Hunnicutt, for example&nbsp;\u2013 who are forced to leave their homes to tend the wounded and dying of the war, and the \"regular Army\" characters, such as Margaret Houlihan and Colonel Potter, who tend to represent patriotism and duty (though Houlihan and Potter could also represent the other perspective at times). Other characters, such as Col. Blake, Maj. Winchester, and Cpl.

This was a result of changes in writing and production staff, rather than the cast defections of McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville, Wayne Rogers and Gary Burghoff. Series co-creator and joke writer [[Larry Gelbart]] departed after Season 4, the first featuring Mike Farrell and Harry Morgan. This resulted in Farrell and Morgan having only a single season reading scripts featuring Gelbart's comic timing, which defined the feel and rhythm of Seasons 1\u20134 featuring predecessors Rogers and Stevenson, respectively. [[Larry Linville]] (the show's [[comic foil]]) and Executive Producer [[Gene Reynolds]] both departed at the conclusion of Season 5 in 1977, resulting in ''M*A*S*H'' being fully stripped of its original comedic foundation by the beginning of Season 6 \u2014 the debut of the Charles Winchester era.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nWhereas Gelbart and Reynolds were the comedic voice of ''M*A*S*H'' for the show's first five seasons (1972\u20131977), [[Alan Alda]] and newly promoted Executive Producer [[Burt Metcalfe]] became the new dramatic voice of ''M*A*S*H'' for Seasons 6\u201311. By the start of Season 8 (1979\u20131980), the writing staff had been completely overhauled, and with the departure of Gary Burghoff, ''M*A*S*H'' displayed a distinctively different feel, consciously moving between comedy and drama.\n\nThe end of the Vietnam War in 1975 was a significant factor as to why storylines become less political in nature and more character driven. Several episodes experimented by going outside the sitcom format:\n* \"Point of View\" \u2013 shown from the perspective of a soldier with a throat wound\n* \"Dreams\" \u2013 an idea of Alda's, where during a deluge of casualties, members of the 4077 take naps on a rotation basis, allowing the viewer to see the simultaneously lyrical and disturbing dreams\n* \"A War For All Seasons\" \u2013 features a story line that takes place over the course of 1951\n* \"Life Time\" \u2013 a precursor to the American television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]],'' it utilizes the [[real time (media)|real time]] method of narration<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nAnother change was the infusion of story lines based on actual events and medical developments that materialized during the Korean War. Considerable research was done by the producers, including interviews with actual MASH surgeons and personnel to develop story lines rooted in the war itself. Such early 1950s events as [[McCarthyism|the McCarthy era]], various sporting events, and the stardom of [[Marilyn Monroe]] were all incorporated into various episodes, a trend that continued until the end of the series.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\nWhile the series remained popular through these changes, it eventually began to run out of creative steam. Korean War doctors regularly contacted producers with experiences that they thought might make for a good storyline, only to learn the idea had previously been used. Harry Morgan admitted that he felt \"the cracks were starting to show\" by season 9 (1980\u20131981).<ref name=\"book of MASH\">{{cite book| last = Kalter| first = Suzy | authorlink = | title = The Complete Book of M*A*S*H| publisher = Abradale Press, Harry M.

In the end, season 11 had 15 episodes (although six had been filmed during season 10 and held over) and a 2-1/2 hour movie, which was treated as five episodes and was filmed before the nine remaining episodes. The final episode produced was the penultimately aired episode \"As Time Goes By\". The series finale movie, titled \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched U.S. television broadcast]] in history at that time, with 106 million viewers.<ref name=\"book of MASH\"/>\n\n===Set location===\n[[File:MASH site - Malibu Creek State Park - 2 January 2010.jpg|thumb|M*A*S*H site in Malibu Creek State Park. Hulk of a Dodge WC54 ambulance. Copy of the original M*A*S*H signpost was installed on the site in 2008.]]\nThe 4077th consisted of two separate sets. An outdoor set in the mountains near Malibu ([[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], Los Angeles County, California) was used for most exterior and tent scenes for every season. This was the same set used to shoot the movie, although there were changes made to the positions of several tents for the TV show. The indoor set, on a sound stage at Fox Studios in [[Century City, California|Century City]], was used for the indoor scenes for the run of the series. Later, after the indoor set was renovated to permit many of the \"outdoor\" scenes to be filmed there, both sets were used for exterior shooting as script requirements dictated (e.g., night scenes were far easier to film on the sound stage, but scenes at the chopper pad required using the ranch).\n\nJust as the series was wrapping production, a brush fire destroyed most of the outdoor set on October 9, 1982. The fire was written into the final episode as a forest fire caused by enemy [[incendiary bomb]]s that forced the 4077th to bug out.\n\nThe Malibu location is today known as [[Malibu Creek State Park]]. Formerly called the Century Ranch and owned by 20th Century Fox Studios until the 1980s, the site today is returning to a natural state, and is marked by a rusted [[Jeep]] and a [[Dodge]] ambulance used in the show. Through the 1990s, the area was occasionally used for television commercial production.\n\nOn February 23, 2008, series stars Mike Farrell, Loretta Swit and William Christopher (along with producers Gene Reynolds and Burt Metcalfe and ''M*A*S*H'' director Charles S. Dubin) reunited at the set to celebrate its partial restoration. The rebuilt signpost is now displayed on weekends, along with tent markers and maps and photos of the set. The state park is open to the public. It was also the location where the film ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'' (1941) and the ''[[Planet of the Apes (TV series)|Planet of the Apes]]'' television series (1974) were filmed, among many other productions. Much of this location, including the signpost and markers, was thought to have been destroyed in the 2018 [[Woolsey Fire]]<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-monica-mountains-20181111-story.html Woolsey fire destroys historic ranches, movie sets and open spaces in Santa Monica Mountains] Retrieved November 11, 2018</ref> but subsequently was determined to have survived the fire.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conejovalleyguide.com/welcome/mash-set-at-malibu-creek-state-park-survives-the-woolsey-fire|title=MASH Set at Malibu Creek State Park Survives the Woolsey Fire|website=Conejo Valley Guide {{!}} Conejo Valley Events|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-28}}</ref>\n\n===Smithsonian exhibit===\n[[File:MASH Operating Room in the National Museum of American History.jpg|thumb|right|The operating room set on display in the [[National Museum of American History]] as part of the \"MASH: Binding Up the Wounds\" exhibit in 1983.]]\nThe exhibit ''M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds'' was at the [[National Museum of American History]] from July 30, 1983 through February 3, 1985.

Sets were decorated with props from the show including the iconic signpost, Hawkeye's still and Major Winchester's [[Webcor]] tape recorder and phonograph. The exhibit also encouraged visitors to compare the show to real Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals of the Korean and the Vietnam Wars.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=M*A*S*H: Binding Up the Wounds {{!}} Smithsonian|url=http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/MASH-Binding-Up-the-Wounds-2721|website=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=PIANTADOS|first1=ROGER|title=MASH Lives, At the Smithsonian|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1983/07/29/mash-lives-at-the-smithsonian/0628f8fa-4794-4eb4-a243-01f524a35e2c/|work=Washington Post|date=July 29, 1983}}</ref>\n\nRadar's teddy bear, originally found at the ranch set, was never on display at the Smithsonian.

A different innovation was based on the show's producers' desire not to have a [[laugh track]], contrary to the network's desire to have one. They compromised by omitting laughter in the scenes set in the operating room. The DVD releases of the series allow viewers to select an audio version with no laugh track.\n\nIn his blog, writer Ken Levine revealed that on one occasion, when the cast offered too many nitpicking \"notes\" on a script,  his writing partner and he changed the script to a \"cold show\" \u2013 one set during the frigid Korean winter. The cast then had to stand around barrel fires in parkas at the Malibu ranch when the temperatures neared {{convert|100|F}}. Levine says, \"This happened maybe twice, and we never got a ticky-tack note again.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Charles Emerson Winchester |url=http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2007/10/charles-emerson-winchester.html |website=... by Ken Levine |author=Ken Levine |date=October 18, 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Jackie Cooper]] wrote that Alan Alda, whom Cooper directed in several episodes during the first two seasons, concealed a lot of hostility beneath the surface, and the two of them barely spoke to each other by the time Cooper's tenure on the show ended.<ref>Jackie Cooper, ''Please Don't Shoot My Dog'', p. 290, William Morrow & Company, 1981</ref>\n\n===Vehicles===\nThe helicopters used on the series were model [[H-13 Sioux]] (military designation and nickname of the [[Bell 47]] civilian model). As in the film, some care seems to have been taken to use the correct model of the long-lived [[Bell Helicopter|Bell]] 47 series. In the opening credits and many of the episodes, Korean War-vintage H-13Ds and Es (Bell 47D-1s) were used complete with period-correct external [[Litter (rescue basket)|litters]]. A later (1954\u201373) 47G occasionally made an appearance. The helicopters are similar in appearance (with the later \"G\" models having larger two-piece fuel tanks, a slightly revised cabin, and other changes) with differences noticeable only to a serious helicopter fan. In the pilot episode, a later Bell 47J (production began in 1957) was shown flying Henry Blake to Seoul, en route to a meeting with General Hammond in Tokyo.<ref>Day, Dwayne A. \"[http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/MASH/HE12.htm MASH/Medevac Helicopters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119001032/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Rotary/MASH/HE12.htm |date=2012-01-19 }}.\" ''Centennial of Flight,'' April 18, 2008.</ref> A [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Sud Aviation Allouette II]] helicopter was also shown transporting Henry Blake to the 4077th in the episode \"Henry, Please Come Home\".\n\nThe [[Jeep]]s used were 1953 military M38 or civil CJ2A [[Willys]] Jeeps and also World War II Ford GPWs and Willys MB's. Two episodes featured the M38A1 Jeep, one of which was stolen from a General by Radar and Hawkeye after their Jeep was stolen. Two of the ambulances were [[WC-54]] Dodges and one was a [[Dodge WC series|WC-27]]. A WC-54 ambulance remains at the site and was burned in the Malibu fires on October 9, 1982, while a second WC-27 survives at a South El Monte museum without any markings. The bus used to transport the wounded was a 1954 [[Ford]] model. In the last season, an M43 ambulance from the Korean War era also was used in conjunction with the WC-54s and WC-27.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Bell 47G-MASH.jpg|Bell 47G helicopter in MASH colours.\nFile:Mashdodge.jpg|Burned Dodge ambulance at Malibu Creek State Park\n\nFile:Mashjeep.jpg|Burned Jeep (most likely a CJ-2A) at Malibu Creek State Park\n</gallery>\n\n===Laugh track===\nSeries creators Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds wanted ''M*A*S*H'' broadcast without a [[laugh track]]. Though CBS initially rejected the idea, a compromise was reached that allowed for omitting the laughter during operating room scenes if desired. \"We told the network that under no circumstances would we ever can laughter during an OR scene when the doctors were working,\" said Gelbart in 1998. \"It's hard to imagine that 300 people were in there laughing at somebody's guts being sewn up.\"<ref>{{cite AV media| people = [[Larry Gelbart|Gelbart, Larry]] | title = Emmy TV Legends: Larry Gelbart Interview | medium = Interview with Dan Harrison | publisher = Archive for American Television | location = [[Los Angeles, California]] | date = May 26, 1998 | url = https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/larry-gelbart}}</ref>\n\nSeasons 1\u20135 utilized a more invasive laugh track; a more subdued audience was employed for Seasons 6\u201311 when the series shifted from sitcom to comedy-drama with the departure of Gelbart and Reynolds. Several episodes (\"O.R.,\" \"The Bus\", \"[[Quo Vadis, Captain Chandler?]]\", \"[[The Interview (M*A*S*H)|The Interview]]\", \"Point of View\", and \"[[Dreams (M*A*S*H)|Dreams]]\" among them) omitted the laugh track altogether; as did almost all of Season 11, including the 135-minute series finale, \"[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]\".<ref name=gelbart/> The laugh track is also omitted from some international and syndicated airings of the show; on one occasion during an airing on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], the laugh track was accidentally left on, and viewers expressed their displeasure, an apology from the network for the \"technical difficulty\" was later released, as during its original run on BBC2 in the UK, it was shown without the laugh track. UK DVD critics speak poorly of the laugh track, stating \"canned laughter is intrusive at the best of times, but with a programme like ''M*A*S*H'', it's downright unbearable.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myreviewer.com/Review_of_MASH_Season_3_DVD_Review/a57838/page2 |title=Myreviewer.com/Review of MASH Season 3 DVD Review |publisher=Myreviewer.com |date=2004-03-20 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}</ref>\n\nOn all released DVDs, both in Region 1 (including the US and Canada) and Region 2 (Europe, including the UK), an option is given to watch the show with or without the laugh track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/mash3.shtml |title=DVD Review: M*A*S*H \u2013 Season Three (Collector's Edition) |publisher=AVRev.com |date=2003-02-18 |accessdate=2011-05-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103002343/http://www.avrev.com/dvd/revs/mash3.shtml |archivedate=November 3, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvd.reviewer.co.uk/reviews/review.asp?Index=4536&User=35366 |title=Another MASH DVD review mentioning audio choices |publisher=Dvd.reviewer.co.uk |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2011-05-17}}</ref>\n\n\"They're a lie,\" said Gelbart in a 1992 interview. \"You're telling an engineer when to push a button to produce a laugh from people who don't exist. It's just so dishonest. The biggest shows when we were on the air were ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' both of which were taped before a live studio audience where laughter made sense,\" continued Gelbart. \"But our show was a film show \u2013 supposedly shot in the middle of [[Korea]]. So the question I always asked the network was, 'Who are these laughing people? Where did they come from?'\" Gelbart persuaded CBS to test the show in private screenings with and without the laugh track. The results showed no measurable difference in the audience's enjoyment. \"So you know what they said?\" Gelbart said. \"'Since there's no difference, let's leave it alone!'

Stories persist that the episode was seen by so many people that the New York City Sanitation/Public Works Department reported the plumbing systems broke down in some parts of the city from so many New Yorkers waiting until the end to use the toilet. Articles copied into Alan Alda's book ''The Last Days of M*A*S*H'' include interviews with New York City Sanitation workers citing the spike in water use on that night. According to the interviews at 11:03 pm, EST New York City public works noted the highest water usage at one given time in the City's history.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Notable wrestling programs to have started or competed in the NCWA and are now in other associations include: [[California Baptist Lancers|California Baptist]], [[McKendree Bearcats|McKendree]], [[Notre Dame College]], and [[SIU Edwardsville Cougars|Southern Illinois Edwardsville]].\n\n== History ==\nA post-secondary athletic association built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling, the NCWA was founded in 1997 as a 501c3 non-profit by the current executive director, Jim Giunta, after resigning as executive director of the Texas Interscholastic Wrestling Association (TIWA). At its founding the association had 13 member teams, but today the NCWA is composed of over 150 wrestling teams and clubs from across the United States and Canada. Many of these programs were formerly NCAA scholarship programs which were affected by Title IX legislation, which has resulted in many colleges being forced to give up their wrestling programs in the name of gender equality. The variety of institutions competing in the NCWA is wide and unrestricted as junior colleges, trade schools and post-secondary prep institutions compete in the same national championship as four-year colleges and universities.\n\n=== NCWA Growth ===\n<ref>http://ncwaalumni.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/5/4/12543370/2013_ncwa_media_guide.pdf</ref>\n{{col begin}}\n{{col 3}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This is evident with advances such as the GoGreco Program, instant replay and challenges in matches, and the Collegiate Cup championship format.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who were passed over by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA schools have a chance to compete at an NCWA program.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who transferred out of an NCAA/NAIA/NJCAA school have a second chance to wrestle in college.\n* Some U.S. states do not have NCAA, NAIA, and/or NJCAA teams with wrestling, but do have at least one NCWA wrestling program, which can make it easier for high school athletes to decide where they want to wrestle in college in terms of financial costs. \n* The NCWA allows student-athletes four total seasons of eligibility with no time frame to complete them unlike the NCAA, who requires student-athletes to complete four seasons of eligibility in five years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school, and the NJCAA, requires student-athletes to complete two seasons of eligibility in three years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school.\n\n=== Similarities with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\n* Collegiate weight classes are used (125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 174, 184, 197, 285&nbsp;lbs).\n* All meets and tournaments use NCAA rules and procedures.\n* All conferences host a Conference Championships tournament with a specific allotment of automatic qualifiers based on placement finish in the Conference Championships.\n* Like the NAIA, a school can enter two wrestlers in the same weight class at the Conference and National Championships (if they both qualify for the latter); one is deemed the scorer and the other the non-scorer (no advancement, match, or placement points are awarded to this wrestler).\n* Like the NAIA, the NCWA allows a student-athlete four total seasons of eligibility regardless of time frame. The NCAA require students to complete their four seasons of eligibility in five years starting from the student's first year of competition (barring a sixth-year grant for hardship). Athletes previously competing for an NCAA, NJCAA, or CCCAA program that transfer to the NCWA will still have the remaining number of eligible seasons without the previous time frame. \n* Like the WCWA, schools traditionally competing in the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, or CCCAA can all compete against one another.\n\n=== Differences with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\nAs mentioned before, the NCWA allows many types of funding to its wrestling programs that might not be allowed by the NCAA. This can allow the wrestling team to grow at its own rate.\n\n==== 235 lb weight class ====\nThe NCWA is the only association with collegiate wrestling to offer an 11th weight class: 235&nbsp;lbs. There are a number of benefits from this: \n* This weight class bridges the weight gap between the 197&nbsp;lb and 285&nbsp;lb weight classes, the biggest weight disparity among any two weight classes. \n* College wrestlers who wrestled in the 195 or 220&nbsp;lb weight classes in high school might find this easier to compete in than having to wrestle at 197&nbsp;lbs or 285&nbsp;lbs. \n* Schools who have two or more prominent athletes in the 197 and/or 285&nbsp;lb weight classes can now give their athletes another chance to succeed individually and earn team points.\n* Another weight class leads to higher team scores at tournaments.\n* The 11th weight class can often be used as a tiebreaker as the first criterion of \"Number of Matches Won\" in dual meet settings.\n\n==== Collegiate Cup Championship Series ====\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, the National Championships in March and the Collegiate Cup Duals (previously known as the National Dual Meet Championship) directly related to each other in a team's point total. A team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals transferred to additional points being awarded at the National Championships.\n\nThe '''National Wrestling Coaches Association''' (or '''\"NWCA\"''') have a National Duals tournament for NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA teams, but all do not tie into their respective National Championships point totals. Penn State University (NCAA D-I) won four straight National Championships from 2011 to 2014 \u2013 without ever competing in the NCAA D-I entry of the National Duals. The NCWA's National Championship Series is the first of any of the college divisions to have a true champion that is indicative of both its team's as well as its individuals' success.\n\n==== GoGreco Program ====\nStarting in 2016, the NCWA launched the GoGreco Program with USA Wrestling.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref> While USA Wrestling's Freestyle and Greco-Roman season and procedures are separate from the wrestling teams and individuals that participate in them, the NCWA owns and operates the GoGreco Program within their domain and directly controls and promotes another wrestling opportunity. This is the first collegiate-level Greco-Roman wrestling national championship. The inaugural championships will take place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of [[Richland College]].\n\nThe first tournament, the Texas GoGreco Championships, took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017 at Richland College. The [[University of North Texas]] won the tournament with six of seven wrestlers winning in the finals. Richland College and [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] finished second and third, respectively.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/texas-colleges-prepare-for-gogreco-nationals</ref>\n\n==== Women's Folkstyle Wrestling ====\nWhereas the WCWA has athletes compete in freestyle, the NCWA has its women's division compete in collegiate folkstyle wrestling. There are a number of teams that compete in both the WCWA and NCWA to give their athletes more competitive opportunity.\n\n== National Events ==\nThe NCWA sponsors nine types national events:\n# '''''[http://www.nationalduals.org/champions-challenge.html The Champions Challenge]'''''\n# '''''[http://nationalduals.org The NCWA National Duals]'''''\n# '''''Regional Duals Championship'''''\n# '''''Conference Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/recruit-me-high-school-wrestling-combine-tickets-31942923143?aff=eac2# Recruit Me High School Wrestling Combine]'''''\n# '''''[http://www.ncwanationals.org/ National Collegiate Wrestling Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://ncwa.net/gogreco GoGreco National Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Vision Forum'''''\n\n=== Champions Challenge ===\nFrom 2010\u20132011, the Champions Challenge was formed by the NAIA and NCWA to bring more highlight matches to the wrestling community by pitting NAIA All-Stars against NCWA All-Stars at each weight class in a dual meet (except for 235&nbsp;lbs since the NAIA does not recognize that weight class in competition). The All-Stars were usually the highest returning All-American at each weight class barring injury; the coaching staffs were one or two coaches for each school represented in the dual. The NCAA Division II is slated to join in the next event.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Champions Challenge series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Dual Meet\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Series Record<br>(Streak)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(1/2)</sup> \n|39\n|NCWA\n|3\n|NAIA 1-0 (1-0)\n|-\n|2011\n|Orlando, Florida<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(2/2)</sup>\n|23\n|NCWA\n|15\n|NAIA 2-0 (2-0)\n|-\n|}\n\n=== National Dual Meet Championship ===\nIn 2008, the NCWA approved the National Dual Meet Championship where the top teams in the country would compete against one another to crown a true team champion starting in 2009. No other association had an official dual-based team champion at the time and that is still the case except in the NCWA. The current structure has 24 teams competing in a bracketed format down to 24 places.\n\nIn its thirteenth season, the NCWA hosted its first National Dual Meet Championship. Whereas the National Championships focuses more on individual success and teams can depend on one or a few exceptional wrestlers, the National Duals highlights teams with solid line-ups and good wrestlers at each weight class. It is common for teams that win or place highly in the National Duals to do so at the National Championships later. The National Duals usually take place in late January before the National Championships.\n\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, two changes took place: 1) the National Dual Meet Championship was now renamed as the Collegiate Cup Duals and 2) a team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals would earn it a certain amount of team points at the National Championships and aid them in winning it. Two major reasons for this change were to 1) encourage more teams to want to wrestle in the Collegiate Cup Duals and, 2) while still recognizing up to two different champions at the two different tournaments, one team could be determined as the best true overall team and individual wrestling champion that year.\n\nDuring the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA ruled that the National Dual Meet Championship will be held on the eastern side of the United States during even-numbered years and on the western side of the United States during odd-numbered years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|NCWA National Dual Meet Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University)\n|Grand Valley<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref><ref>http://multibriefs.com/briefs/ncwa/NCWA020309.php</ref>\n|33\n|Central Florida<br>\n|18\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Shelbyville, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University and [[University of Georgia]])\n|Marion Military<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref>\n|27\n|Apprentice<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|[[Dalton, Georgia]]<br>([[Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center]])\n|California Baptist <sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=918</ref><ref>https://cbulancers.com/news/2011/1/30/SWEET_GEORGIA_CHAMPS.aspx</ref>\n|42\n|Central Florida<br>\n|4\n|First team to win event while in transition to another association.\n|-\n|2012\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(1/5)</sup> <ref>http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page=showarticle&ArticleID=24627</ref><ref>http://daltondailycitizen.com/sports/x1296872934/Something-gained-Flames-win-title-at-NCWA-National-Duals</ref>\n|25\n|Lindenwood<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Lindenwood <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1217</ref><ref>http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2013/1/19/WREST_0119130858.aspx</ref>\n|30\n|Liberty <br>\n|19\n|First time the event was a rematch of the previous year's finals.\n|-\n|2014\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Grand Canyon<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/grand-canyon-edges-shorter-to-claim-ncwa-collegiate-cup-dual-championship/33909</ref>\n|23\n|Shorter<br>\n|19\n|First time the event became the Collegiate Cup Duals and team points were a factor for the overall Collegiate Cup championship.<br> \n|-\n|2015\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(2/5)</sup><ref>http://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=960&TeamID=</ref>\n|37\n|Apprentice<br>\n|9\n|First team to win event more than once.\n|-\n|2016\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Central Florida <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2016/ucf-wins-first-national-duals-title-defeats-grand-valley-state</ref>\n|32\n|Grand Valley State<br>\n|18\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|[[Lynchburg, Virginia]]<br>(Liberty University)\n|Emmanuel <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Features/2017/January/28/Emmanuel-wins-NCWA-Duals-title</ref>\n|33\n|Liberty<br>\n|13\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Liberty <sup>(3/5)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/liberty-tops-emmanuel-30-15-for-duals-title-gvsu-3rd</ref>\n|30\n|Emmanuel<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Mesquite, Nevada]]<br>([[CasaBlanca Resort|CasaBlanca Resort Event Center]])\n|Liberty <sup>(4/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/a8e864a1-d3fb-429b-aacc-fa439d69b150</ref>\n|28\n|Apprentice<br>\n|18\n|First school to win back-to-back titles\n|-\n|2020\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Men's: Liberty <sup>(5/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref><ref>https://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=3222&TeamID=</ref><br>Women's: Schreiner <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref>\n|43<br>48\n|Men's: Apprentice<br>Women's: Liberty\n|13<br>6\n|First ever Women's National Dual Meet Championship\n|-\n|}\n\n==== 6:12 Project ====\nThe 6:12 Project is a community outreach program created by the NCWA for its wrestlers, coaches, officials, volunteers, and staff to help the city hosting the NCWA National Duals. NCWA wrestling programs serve food to those in need and hold canned and non-perishable food drives. They later donate those goods, as well as clothes (especially jackets), to one of the city's organizations.\n\nThe name \"6:12 Project\" comes from the Biblical quote Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12 from the New Testament:\n:\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\"\n  \nThe first 6:12 Project took place at the 2012 National Duals in Dalton, Georgia and repeated for the 2013 and 2014 events which were also held in Dalton. It is scheduled to continue at the 2015 Collegiate Cup Duals in Dalton again.\n\n=== NCWA Regional Duals Championship ===\nInitially created as the Western Regional Duals, this event was created in order to give teams in the western and central part of North America the opportunity to compete in a national dual meet event like the National Dual Meet Championship.\n\nHistorically, the National Dual Meet Championship has been hosted on the eastern side of the United States in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia. When the Collegiate Cup was passed in 2013, questions and concerns were raised as to whether teams closer to the physical location of the National Dual Meet Championship would have an unfair competitive advantage in terms of championship points calculated for the Collegiate Cup series.\n\nAt the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA passed a resolution stating that in even-numbered years the National Duals would take place on the eastern side and the Regional Duals on the western side; in odd-numbered years, the National Duals would take place at a western location and the Regional Duals an eastern location.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Regional Duals Championship series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|[[St. George, Utah]]<br>([[Dixie State University]])\n|[[Grays Harbor College|Grays Harbor]] <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/2017-ncwa-western-regional-dual-championship-results</ref>\n|33\n|[[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young]]<br>\n|23\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]<br>([[Western High School (Las Vegas)|Western High School]])\n|Brigham Young<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/byu-beats-colorado-state-for-first-regional-duals-title</ref>\n|38\n|<br>[[Colorado State University|Colorado State]]\n|10\n|First time a team appeared in consecutive finals matches\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Akron, Ohio]]<br>([[Springfield High School (Akron, Ohio)|Springfield High School]])\n|[[Mott Community College|Mott]]<sup>(1/1)</sup>\n|38\n|[[East Carolina University|East Carolina]]<br>\n|18\n|First Regional Dual Championship to take place in the East\n|-\n|2020\n|[[Surprise, Arizona]]<br>([[Ottawa University|Ottawa University Surprise]])\n|[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|Nevada - Las Vegas]]<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/367c40a8-7f5b-03e6-e3c5-aad907449b04</ref>\n|39\n|[[Wayne State University|Wayne State]]<br>\n|24\n|Round-robin format was used\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Conference Championships ===\nFollowing the inaugural season, the NCWA approved a five-conference format where wrestlers would compete for advancement into the National Championships as well as seeding if they qualified. The number of conferences has fluctuated throughout the years including reaching a record high of 9 and currently set at 8. Additionally, some conferences have been re-named over the years. These conferences are geographically-based and are similar to the National Championships tournament where Division I and II programs wrestle in one bracket, but differ in that team scores are kept as one tournament (unlike the National Championships having a Division I team score and Division II team score). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|1998 Conference Champions\n|-\n!

Most athletes are high school student-athletes which is the primary focus, however students at a post-secondary institution without a wrestling program may also attend. The event also allows students to ask questions about collegiate competition to college coaches.\n\n=== Men's Collegiate Wrestling Championships ===\nThe first major event the NCWA hosted took place in 1998 was the inaugural National Championships with 26 teams in one division in the 10 then-standard weight classes. Since then, the event has grown to include approximately 340 qualifiers among 150+ teams within the 11 NCWA weight classes where two champions are crowned (Division I and Division II).\n\nHere, individuals are recognized for their outstanding individual achievement. They can earn team points (unless they are the non-scorer on their team) by advancing through the tournament, scoring bonus points in matches, and placing in the top 8. Teams accumulate points from all of their scoring wrestlers. The National Championships have traditionally been held in the middle of March. Division I and Division II teams compete in one bracketed tournament where the overall team points are separated at the end between the two.\n\nIn 1998, the NCWA approved an eleventh weight class, the 235&nbsp;lb weight class.\n\nIn 2007, the NCWA approved All-American status for wrestlers placing in top 8. Previously, only the top 6 wrestlers in each weight class were named All-Americans.\n\nIn 2010, the NCWA approved a two-division classification system - the Division I level composed of established teams meeting specific criteria and the Division II tier where up-start teams as well as teams aiming to join Division I would compete.\n\nSince the 2013\u20132014 season when the Collegiate Cup championship series was passed, teams' National Championships points are added with their National Dual Meet Championship finish points to determine the overall team champion.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or during the tournament due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n{|

Championships ===\nThe first Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships took place at the 2008 National Championships. The NCWA sponsored this event under their new banner organization, the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Association ('''NCWWA'''). The weight classes have been designed to closely resemble most female athletes' natural weight ranges as well as let programs that also compete in women's collegiate freestyle to acclimate to folkstyle competition. To date, the NCWA is still the only collegiate association in the United States to officially recognize women's collegiate wrestling. Whereas before matches were done using freestyle rules, as was the norm with associations like the WCWA, the NCWWA uses collegiate/folkstyle rules like in the NCWA, NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA.\n\nNo team score was recorded at the inaugural 2008 tournament, but since then team score has been kept. Bo Icalia and Josh White are tied for head coaches to have won the most titles; Icalia won the 2010 and 2011 titles as head coach of [[Yakima Valley Community College]] and the 2012 and 2013 titles as head coach of [[Southwestern Oregon Community College]]. White has won the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 titles all with Southwestern Oregon Community College.\n\nThe top 3 wrestlers in each weight class are recognized as All-Americans. [[University of South Florida]]'s Jasmine Grant is the NCWWA's first and only 4x All-American (2011\u20132014) so far. [[University of Maine]]'s Samantha Frank has won 3 national titles going into the 2017\u20132018 season.\n\nThe Women's College Wrestling Championships has traditionally been dominated by northern and northwestern teams.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or after it had started in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Women's Collegiate National Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Team championship\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Most Outstanding Wrestler<br>(Team)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2008\n|Lakeland, Florida<br>(Lakeland Center)\n|colspan=4|No team score kept\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Hampton, Virginia<br>(Hampton University)\n|Yakima Valley<ref>http://www.ncwwa.net/news?news_id=13</ref>\n|73.0\n|Simon Fraser<br>\n|58.0\n|Ashlee Phy (Yakima Valley)\n|-\n|2010\n|Hampton, Virginia<br>(Hampton University)\n|Yakima Valley\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Macon, Georgia<br>(Mercer University)\n|Yakima Valley<ref>http://www.yakimaherald.com/sports</ref>\n|124.0\n|Mercer\n|45.0\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Daytona Beach, Florida<br>(Ocean Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.goboxers.com/news/2012/3/12/WWREST_0312121801.aspx?path=wwrestling</ref>\n|83.5\n|Pacific\n|61.5\n|Erica Poe (Southwestern Oregon)\n|-\n|2013\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.ncwwa.net/news?news_id=26</ref>\n|100.0\n|Lindenwood \u2013 Belleville\n|53.0\n|Sonia Beri (San Jose)\n|-\n|2014\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1397</ref>\n|77.0\n|[[West Chester University|West Chester]]\n|31.0\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/liberty-wins-2015-ncwa-national-championships/57034</ref>\n|128.0\n|Ottawa\n|98.0\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2016\n|Kissimmee, Florida<br>(Silver Spurs Arena)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|127.0\n|Ottawa\n|83.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2017\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|97.5\n|Ottawa\n|69.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2018\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|134.0\n|Midland\n|52.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2019\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Grays Harbor\n|65.5\n|Schreiner\n|63.0\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Schreiner\n|170.5\n|[[Umpqua Community College|Umpqua]]\n|119.5\n|Cendall Manley (Liberty)<ref>http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=379056</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n=== GoGreco National Championships ===\nApproved in 2016, the GoGreco Program was launched with USA Wrestling in order to improve the U.S.A.'s performance in Junior- and Senior-level Greco-Roman competition. The GoGreco season starts on the last weekend of March and concludes with the GoGreco Collegiate National Championships on the first weekend of June.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref>\n\nGoGreco Nationals is an open-entry event to any NCWA Member institution. NCAA, NAIA & NJCAA institutions that are not currently a member of the NCWA are encouraged to join the NCWA for the GoGreco Season and to send athletes to the Nationals. Student-athletes must maintain the same academic standards that are required of the NCWA and their member institutions in order to compete.\n\nThe inaugural championships took place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of Richland College.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|GoGreco National Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host team)\n! colspan=4|Team championship\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(1/3)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/north-texas-wins-first-greco-roman-college-nationals</ref>\n|55.0\n|Richland\n|34.0\n|Inaugural championships\n|-\n|2018\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(2/3)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/north-texas-defends-its-gogreco-championship-with-four-champions</ref>\n|49.0\n|Richland\n|37.0\n|Most Outstanding Wrestler: Dominic Vazquez (Toledo)\n|-\n|2019\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(3/3)</sup>\n|83.0\n|Richland\n|42.0\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Vision Forum ===\nEvery year since 1997, the NCWA's Vision Forum convenes during the wrestling off-season in the summer and is held at about the same location as and set a few days before the National Wrestling Coaches Association Convention.

With the National Dual Meet Championship, the team that wins the Collegiate Cup will earn 24 team points. The runner-up will receive 23, third-place 22, and so forth until the 23rd-place team receives 2 points. All other teams that participated, but did not place in the top 23 will receive 1 point. Those points will be carried over to the individual-based National Championships where teams will continue to score points based on their individual athletes' performances.\n\nThe winner of the Collegiate Cup will have accrued the most total points between both events and be presented with the College Cup as the overall NCWA National Champions. Grand Canyon University was the first champion of the new format in 2014.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Championship Year !! Champion School !!

Men's Division I programs are athletic department funded or have met the NCWA's D-I criteria. Many of the Division I programs also offer athletic scholarships.  Men's Division II teams are broken into categories; Emerging Programs, that are developing into Division I teams, and Clubs that operate on campuses where there are established NCAA/NCAA/NJCAA Teams; few Division II schools are of the latter circumstance. Schools whose wrestling teams are competing in the NCWA during their school's transitional period are placed into Division I. Women's programs are any collegiate/post-seconday scholastic programs who also compete in the collegiate folkstyle ruleset. GoGreco programs have most of the same set-up as the men's and women's divisions with the exception that it is under a Greco-Roman ruleset. \n\nIn August 2010, the current two-division system was passed at that year's Vision Forum and implemented for the 2011 National Championships.\n\n=== Conferences ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is led by founder and executive director Jim Giunta headquartered in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and built to help the promotion of [[collegiate wrestling]].\n\nMany teams were formerly [[NCAA]] programs displaced by Title IX legislation and/or are preparing to join the NCAA, [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], or [[NJCAA]]. Teams in transition to a higher division not eligible for the NCAA postseason also compete in the NCWA. Notable wrestling programs to have started or competed in the NCWA and are now in other associations include: [[California Baptist Lancers|California Baptist]], [[McKendree Bearcats|McKendree]], [[Notre Dame College]], and [[SIU Edwardsville Cougars|Southern Illinois Edwardsville]].\n\n== History ==\nA post-secondary athletic association built to help the promotion of collegiate wrestling, the NCWA was founded in 1997 as a 501c3 non-profit by the current executive director, Jim Giunta, after resigning as executive director of the Texas Interscholastic Wrestling Association (TIWA). At its founding the association had 13 member teams, but today the NCWA is composed of over 150 wrestling teams and clubs from across the United States and Canada. Many of these programs were formerly NCAA scholarship programs which were affected by Title IX legislation, which has resulted in many colleges being forced to give up their wrestling programs in the name of gender equality.

This is evident with advances such as the GoGreco Program, instant replay and challenges in matches, and the Collegiate Cup championship format.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who were passed over by NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA schools have a chance to compete at an NCWA program.\n* Talented high school student-athletes who transferred out of an NCAA/NAIA/NJCAA school have a second chance to wrestle in college.\n* Some U.S. states do not have NCAA, NAIA, and/or NJCAA teams with wrestling, but do have at least one NCWA wrestling program, which can make it easier for high school athletes to decide where they want to wrestle in college in terms of financial costs. \n* The NCWA allows student-athletes four total seasons of eligibility with no time frame to complete them unlike the NCAA, who requires student-athletes to complete four seasons of eligibility in five years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school, and the NJCAA, requires student-athletes to complete two seasons of eligibility in three years of enrollment starting from the student's first year at the school.\n\n=== Similarities with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\n* Collegiate weight classes are used (125, 133, 141, 149, 157, 165, 174, 184, 197, 285&nbsp;lbs).\n* All meets and tournaments use NCAA rules and procedures.\n* All conferences host a Conference Championships tournament with a specific allotment of automatic qualifiers based on placement finish in the Conference Championships.\n* Like the NAIA, a school can enter two wrestlers in the same weight class at the Conference and National Championships (if they both qualify for the latter); one is deemed the scorer and the other the non-scorer (no advancement, match, or placement points are awarded to this wrestler).\n* Like the NAIA, the NCWA allows a student-athlete four total seasons of eligibility regardless of time frame. The NCAA require students to complete their four seasons of eligibility in five years starting from the student's first year of competition (barring a sixth-year grant for hardship). Athletes previously competing for an NCAA, NJCAA, or CCCAA program that transfer to the NCWA will still have the remaining number of eligible seasons without the previous time frame. \n* Like the WCWA, schools traditionally competing in the NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, or CCCAA can all compete against one another.\n\n=== Differences with NCAA, NAIA, NJCAA, CCCAA, and WCWA ===\nAs mentioned before, the NCWA allows many types of funding to its wrestling programs that might not be allowed by the NCAA. This can allow the wrestling team to grow at its own rate.\n\n==== 235 lb weight class ====\nThe NCWA is the only association with collegiate wrestling to offer an 11th weight class: 235&nbsp;lbs. There are a number of benefits from this: \n* This weight class bridges the weight gap between the 197&nbsp;lb and 285&nbsp;lb weight classes, the biggest weight disparity among any two weight classes. \n* College wrestlers who wrestled in the 195 or 220&nbsp;lb weight classes in high school might find this easier to compete in than having to wrestle at 197&nbsp;lbs or 285&nbsp;lbs. \n* Schools who have two or more prominent athletes in the 197 and/or 285&nbsp;lb weight classes can now give their athletes another chance to succeed individually and earn team points.\n* Another weight class leads to higher team scores at tournaments.\n* The 11th weight class can often be used as a tiebreaker as the first criterion of \"Number of Matches Won\" in dual meet settings.\n\n==== Collegiate Cup Championship Series ====\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, the National Championships in March and the Collegiate Cup Duals (previously known as the National Dual Meet Championship) directly related to each other in a team's point total. A team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals transferred to additional points being awarded at the National Championships.\n\nThe '''National Wrestling Coaches Association''' (or '''\"NWCA\"''') have a National Duals tournament for NCAA Division I, Division II, Division III, NAIA, NJCAA, and NCWA teams, but all do not tie into their respective National Championships point totals. Penn State University (NCAA D-I) won four straight National Championships from 2011 to 2014 \u2013 without ever competing in the NCAA D-I entry of the National Duals. The NCWA's National Championship Series is the first of any of the college divisions to have a true champion that is indicative of both its team's as well as its individuals' success.\n\n==== GoGreco Program ====\nStarting in 2016, the NCWA launched the GoGreco Program with USA Wrestling.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref> While USA Wrestling's Freestyle and Greco-Roman season and procedures are separate from the wrestling teams and individuals that participate in them, the NCWA owns and operates the GoGreco Program within their domain and directly controls and promotes another wrestling opportunity. This is the first collegiate-level Greco-Roman wrestling national championship. The inaugural championships will take place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of [[Richland College]].\n\nThe first tournament, the Texas GoGreco Championships, took place on Saturday, May 6, 2017 at Richland College. The [[University of North Texas]] won the tournament with six of seven wrestlers winning in the finals. Richland College and [[University of Houston\u2013Downtown]] finished second and third, respectively.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/texas-colleges-prepare-for-gogreco-nationals</ref>\n\n==== Women's Folkstyle Wrestling ====\nWhereas the WCWA has athletes compete in freestyle, the NCWA has its women's division compete in collegiate folkstyle wrestling. There are a number of teams that compete in both the WCWA and NCWA to give their athletes more competitive opportunity.\n\n== National Events ==\nThe NCWA sponsors nine types national events:\n# '''''[http://www.nationalduals.org/champions-challenge.html The Champions Challenge]'''''\n# '''''[http://nationalduals.org The NCWA National Duals]'''''\n# '''''Regional Duals Championship'''''\n# '''''Conference Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/recruit-me-high-school-wrestling-combine-tickets-31942923143?aff=eac2# Recruit Me High School Wrestling Combine]'''''\n# '''''[http://www.ncwanationals.org/ National Collegiate Wrestling Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships'''''\n# '''''[https://ncwa.net/gogreco GoGreco National Championships]'''''\n# '''''The Vision Forum'''''\n\n=== Champions Challenge ===\nFrom 2010\u20132011, the Champions Challenge was formed by the NAIA and NCWA to bring more highlight matches to the wrestling community by pitting NAIA All-Stars against NCWA All-Stars at each weight class in a dual meet (except for 235&nbsp;lbs since the NAIA does not recognize that weight class in competition). The All-Stars were usually the highest returning All-American at each weight class barring injury; the coaching staffs were one or two coaches for each school represented in the dual. The NCAA Division II is slated to join in the next event.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Champions Challenge series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Dual Meet\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Series Record<br>(Streak)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Orlando, Florida]]<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(1/2)</sup> \n|39\n|NCWA\n|3\n|NAIA 1-0 (1-0)\n|-\n|2011\n|Orlando, Florida<br>(University of Central Florida)\n|NAIA<sup>(2/2)</sup>\n|23\n|NCWA\n|15\n|NAIA 2-0 (2-0)\n|-\n|}\n\n=== National Dual Meet Championship ===\nIn 2008, the NCWA approved the National Dual Meet Championship where the top teams in the country would compete against one another to crown a true team champion starting in 2009. No other association had an official dual-based team champion at the time and that is still the case except in the NCWA. The current structure has 24 teams competing in a bracketed format down to 24 places.\n\nIn its thirteenth season, the NCWA hosted its first National Dual Meet Championship. Whereas the National Championships focuses more on individual success and teams can depend on one or a few exceptional wrestlers, the National Duals highlights teams with solid line-ups and good wrestlers at each weight class. It is common for teams that win or place highly in the National Duals to do so at the National Championships later. The National Duals usually take place in late January before the National Championships.\n\nStarting in the 2013\u20132014 season, two changes took place: 1) the National Dual Meet Championship was now renamed as the Collegiate Cup Duals and 2) a team's finish at the Collegiate Cup Duals would earn it a certain amount of team points at the National Championships and aid them in winning it. Two major reasons for this change were to 1) encourage more teams to want to wrestle in the Collegiate Cup Duals and, 2) while still recognizing up to two different champions at the two different tournaments, one team could be determined as the best true overall team and individual wrestling champion that year.\n\nDuring the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA ruled that the National Dual Meet Championship will be held on the eastern side of the United States during even-numbered years and on the western side of the United States during odd-numbered years.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|NCWA National Dual Meet Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2009\n|[[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University)\n|Grand Valley<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref><ref>http://multibriefs.com/briefs/ncwa/NCWA020309.php</ref>\n|33\n|Central Florida<br>\n|18\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2010\n|[[Shelbyville, Tennessee]]<br>(Middle Tennessee State University and [[University of Georgia]])\n|Marion Military<sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.nationalduals.org/college.html</ref>\n|27\n|Apprentice<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|[[Dalton, Georgia]]<br>([[Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center]])\n|California Baptist <sup>(1/1)</sup> <ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=918</ref><ref>https://cbulancers.com/news/2011/1/30/SWEET_GEORGIA_CHAMPS.aspx</ref>\n|42\n|Central Florida<br>\n|4\n|First team to win event while in transition to another association.\n|-\n|2012\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(1/5)</sup> <ref>http://themat.com/section.php?section_id=3&page=showarticle&ArticleID=24627</ref><ref>http://daltondailycitizen.com/sports/x1296872934/Something-gained-Flames-win-title-at-NCWA-National-Duals</ref>\n|25\n|Lindenwood<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2013\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Lindenwood <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1217</ref><ref>http://www.lindenwoodlions.com/news/2013/1/19/WREST_0119130858.aspx</ref>\n|30\n|Liberty <br>\n|19\n|First time the event was a rematch of the previous year's finals.\n|-\n|2014\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Grand Canyon<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/grand-canyon-edges-shorter-to-claim-ncwa-collegiate-cup-dual-championship/33909</ref>\n|23\n|Shorter<br>\n|19\n|First time the event became the Collegiate Cup Duals and team points were a factor for the overall Collegiate Cup championship.<br> \n|-\n|2015\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Liberty <sup>(2/5)</sup><ref>http://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=960&TeamID=</ref>\n|37\n|Apprentice<br>\n|9\n|First team to win event more than once.\n|-\n|2016\n|Dalton, Georgia<br>(Northwest Georgia Trade and Convention Center)\n|Central Florida <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2016/ucf-wins-first-national-duals-title-defeats-grand-valley-state</ref>\n|32\n|Grand Valley State<br>\n|18\n|\n|-\n|2017\n|[[Lynchburg, Virginia]]<br>(Liberty University)\n|Emmanuel <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Wrestling/Features/2017/January/28/Emmanuel-wins-NCWA-Duals-title</ref>\n|33\n|Liberty<br>\n|13\n|\n|-\n|2018\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Liberty <sup>(3/5)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/liberty-tops-emmanuel-30-15-for-duals-title-gvsu-3rd</ref>\n|30\n|Emmanuel<br>\n|15\n|\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Mesquite, Nevada]]<br>([[CasaBlanca Resort|CasaBlanca Resort Event Center]])\n|Liberty <sup>(4/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/a8e864a1-d3fb-429b-aacc-fa439d69b150</ref>\n|28\n|Apprentice<br>\n|18\n|First school to win back-to-back titles\n|-\n|2020\n|Lynchburg, Virginia<br>(Liberty University)\n|Men's: Liberty <sup>(5/5)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref><ref>https://www.liberty.edu/campusrec/clubsports/index.cfm?PID=25954&NewsID=3222&TeamID=</ref><br>Women's: Schreiner <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/8cfaf5d4-e571-3651-e44a-23a019761d69</ref>\n|43<br>48\n|Men's: Apprentice<br>Women's: Liberty\n|13<br>6\n|First ever Women's National Dual Meet Championship\n|-\n|}\n\n==== 6:12 Project ====\nThe 6:12 Project is a community outreach program created by the NCWA for its wrestlers, coaches, officials, volunteers, and staff to help the city hosting the NCWA National Duals. NCWA wrestling programs serve food to those in need and hold canned and non-perishable food drives. They later donate those goods, as well as clothes (especially jackets), to one of the city's organizations.\n\nThe name \"6:12 Project\" comes from the Biblical quote Ephesians chapter 6, verse 12 from the New Testament:\n:\"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against power, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.\"\n  \nThe first 6:12 Project took place at the 2012 National Duals in Dalton, Georgia and repeated for the 2013 and 2014 events which were also held in Dalton. It is scheduled to continue at the 2015 Collegiate Cup Duals in Dalton again.\n\n=== NCWA Regional Duals Championship ===\nInitially created as the Western Regional Duals, this event was created in order to give teams in the western and central part of North America the opportunity to compete in a national dual meet event like the National Dual Meet Championship.\n\nHistorically, the National Dual Meet Championship has been hosted on the eastern side of the United States in Georgia, Tennessee, or Virginia. When the Collegiate Cup was passed in 2013, questions and concerns were raised as to whether teams closer to the physical location of the National Dual Meet Championship would have an unfair competitive advantage in terms of championship points calculated for the Collegiate Cup series.\n\nAt the 2017 Vision Forum, the NCWA passed a resolution stating that in even-numbered years the National Duals would take place on the eastern side and the Regional Duals on the western side; in odd-numbered years, the National Duals would take place at a western location and the Regional Duals an eastern location.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Regional Duals Championship series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Finals match\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|[[St. George, Utah]]<br>([[Dixie State University]])\n|[[Grays Harbor College|Grays Harbor]] <sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/2017-ncwa-western-regional-dual-championship-results</ref>\n|33\n|[[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young]]<br>\n|23\n|Inaugural event.\n|-\n|2018\n|[[Las Vegas|Las Vegas, Nevada]]<br>([[Western High School (Las Vegas)|Western High School]])\n|Brigham Young<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/byu-beats-colorado-state-for-first-regional-duals-title</ref>\n|38\n|<br>[[Colorado State University|Colorado State]]\n|10\n|First time a team appeared in consecutive finals matches\n|-\n|2019\n|[[Akron, Ohio]]<br>([[Springfield High School (Akron, Ohio)|Springfield High School]])\n|[[Mott Community College|Mott]]<sup>(1/1)</sup>\n|38\n|[[East Carolina University|East Carolina]]<br>\n|18\n|First Regional Dual Championship to take place in the East\n|-\n|2020\n|[[Surprise, Arizona]]<br>([[Ottawa University|Ottawa University Surprise]])\n|[[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|Nevada - Las Vegas]]<sup>(1/1)</sup><ref>https://arena.flowrestling.org/event/367c40a8-7f5b-03e6-e3c5-aad907449b04</ref>\n|39\n|[[Wayne State University|Wayne State]]<br>\n|24\n|Round-robin format was used\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Conference Championships ===\nFollowing the inaugural season, the NCWA approved a five-conference format where wrestlers would compete for advancement into the National Championships as well as seeding if they qualified. The number of conferences has fluctuated throughout the years including reaching a record high of 9 and currently set at 8. Additionally, some conferences have been re-named over the years. These conferences are geographically-based and are similar to the National Championships tournament where Division I and II programs wrestle in one bracket, but differ in that team scores are kept as one tournament (unlike the National Championships having a Division I team score and Division II team score). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|1998 Conference Champions\n|-\n!

Most athletes are high school student-athletes which is the primary focus, however students at a post-secondary institution without a wrestling program may also attend. The event also allows students to ask questions about collegiate competition to college coaches.\n\n=== Men's Collegiate Wrestling Championships ===\nThe first major event the NCWA hosted took place in 1998 was the inaugural National Championships with 26 teams in one division in the 10 then-standard weight classes. Since then, the event has grown to include approximately 340 qualifiers among 150+ teams within the 11 NCWA weight classes where two champions are crowned (Division I and Division II).\n\nHere, individuals are recognized for their outstanding individual achievement. They can earn team points (unless they are the non-scorer on their team) by advancing through the tournament, scoring bonus points in matches, and placing in the top 8. Teams accumulate points from all of their scoring wrestlers. The National Championships have traditionally been held in the middle of March. Division I and Division II teams compete in one bracketed tournament where the overall team points are separated at the end between the two.\n\nIn 1998, the NCWA approved an eleventh weight class, the 235&nbsp;lb weight class.\n\nIn 2007, the NCWA approved All-American status for wrestlers placing in top 8. Previously, only the top 6 wrestlers in each weight class were named All-Americans.\n\nIn 2010, the NCWA approved a two-division classification system - the Division I level composed of established teams meeting specific criteria and the Division II tier where up-start teams as well as teams aiming to join Division I would compete.\n\nSince the 2013\u20132014 season when the Collegiate Cup championship series was passed, teams' National Championships points are added with their National Dual Meet Championship finish points to determine the overall team champion.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or during the tournament due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]]. \n\n{|

Championships ===\nThe first Women's Collegiate Wrestling Championships took place at the 2008 National Championships. The NCWA sponsored this event under their new banner organization, the National Collegiate Women's Wrestling Association ('''NCWWA'''). The weight classes have been designed to closely resemble most female athletes' natural weight ranges as well as let programs that also compete in women's collegiate freestyle to acclimate to folkstyle competition. To date, the NCWA is still the only collegiate association in the United States to officially recognize women's collegiate wrestling. Whereas before matches were done using freestyle rules, as was the norm with associations like the WCWA, the NCWWA uses collegiate/folkstyle rules like in the NCWA, NCAA, NAIA, and NJCAA.\n\nNo team score was recorded at the inaugural 2008 tournament, but since then team score has been kept. Bo Icalia and Josh White are tied for head coaches to have won the most titles; Icalia won the 2010 and 2011 titles as head coach of [[Yakima Valley Community College]] and the 2012 and 2013 titles as head coach of [[Southwestern Oregon Community College]]. White has won the 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 titles all with Southwestern Oregon Community College.\n\nThe top 3 wrestlers in each weight class are recognized as All-Americans. [[University of South Florida]]'s Jasmine Grant is the NCWWA's first and only 4x All-American (2011\u20132014) so far. [[University of Maine]]'s Samantha Frank has won 3 national titles going into the 2017\u20132018 season.\n\nThe Women's College Wrestling Championships has traditionally been dominated by northern and northwestern teams.\n\nIn 2020, multiple teams and individual wrestlers withdrew from the tournament before or after it had started in response to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|Women's Collegiate National Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host location)\n! colspan=4|Team championship\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Most Outstanding Wrestler<br>(Team)\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2008\n|Lakeland, Florida<br>(Lakeland Center)\n|colspan=4|No team score kept\n|\n|-\n|2009\n|Hampton, Virginia<br>(Hampton University)\n|Yakima Valley<ref>http://www.ncwwa.net/news?news_id=13</ref>\n|73.0\n|Simon Fraser<br>\n|58.0\n|Ashlee Phy (Yakima Valley)\n|-\n|2010\n|Hampton, Virginia<br>(Hampton University)\n|Yakima Valley\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|2011\n|Macon, Georgia<br>(Mercer University)\n|Yakima Valley<ref>http://www.yakimaherald.com/sports</ref>\n|124.0\n|Mercer\n|45.0\n|\n|-\n|2012\n|Daytona Beach, Florida<br>(Ocean Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.goboxers.com/news/2012/3/12/WWREST_0312121801.aspx?path=wwrestling</ref>\n|83.5\n|Pacific\n|61.5\n|Erica Poe (Southwestern Oregon)\n|-\n|2013\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.ncwwa.net/news?news_id=26</ref>\n|100.0\n|Lindenwood \u2013 Belleville\n|53.0\n|Sonia Beri (San Jose)\n|-\n|2014\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://www.ncwa.net/news?news_id=1397</ref>\n|77.0\n|[[West Chester University|West Chester]]\n|31.0\n|\n|-\n|2015\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon<ref>http://news.theopenmat.com/college-wrestling-news/liberty-wins-2015-ncwa-national-championships/57034</ref>\n|128.0\n|Ottawa\n|98.0\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2016\n|Kissimmee, Florida<br>(Silver Spurs Arena)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|127.0\n|Ottawa\n|83.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2017\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|97.5\n|Ottawa\n|69.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2018\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Southwestern Oregon\n|134.0\n|Midland\n|52.5\n|Samantha Frank (Maine)\n|-\n|2019\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Grays Harbor\n|65.5\n|Schreiner\n|63.0\n|\n|-\n|2020\n|Allen, Texas<br>(Allen Event Center)\n|Schreiner\n|170.5\n|[[Umpqua Community College|Umpqua]]\n|119.5\n|Cendall Manley (Liberty)<ref>http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&MID=379056</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n=== GoGreco National Championships ===\nApproved in 2016, the GoGreco Program was launched with USA Wrestling in order to improve the U.S.A.'s performance in Junior- and Senior-level Greco-Roman competition. The GoGreco season starts on the last weekend of March and concludes with the GoGreco Collegiate National Championships on the first weekend of June.<ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/college-gogreco-season-announced</ref>\n\nGoGreco Nationals is an open-entry event to any NCWA Member institution. NCAA, NAIA & NJCAA institutions that are not currently a member of the NCWA are encouraged to join the NCWA for the GoGreco Season and to send athletes to the Nationals. Student-athletes must maintain the same academic standards that are required of the NCWA and their member institutions in order to compete.\n\nThe inaugural championships took place on June 3, 2017 in Dallas, Texas on the campus of Richland College.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=10|GoGreco National Championships series history\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year \n! rowspan=\"2\"|Host city<br>(Host team)\n! colspan=4|Team championship\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Notes\n|-\n!Winner \n!Points\n!Runner-up \n!Points\n|-\n|2017\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(1/3)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2017/north-texas-wins-first-greco-roman-college-nationals</ref>\n|55.0\n|Richland\n|34.0\n|Inaugural championships\n|-\n|2018\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(2/3)</sup><ref>https://ncwa.net/news/2018/north-texas-defends-its-gogreco-championship-with-four-champions</ref>\n|49.0\n|Richland\n|37.0\n|Most Outstanding Wrestler: Dominic Vazquez (Toledo)\n|-\n|2019\n|Dallas, Texas<br>(Richland College)\n|North Texas<sup>(3/3)</sup>\n|83.0\n|Richland\n|42.0\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Vision Forum ===\nEvery year since 1997, the NCWA's Vision Forum convenes during the wrestling off-season in the summer and is held at about the same location as and set a few days before the National Wrestling Coaches Association Convention.

With the National Dual Meet Championship, the team that wins the Collegiate Cup will earn 24 team points. The runner-up will receive 23, third-place 22, and so forth until the 23rd-place team receives 2 points. All other teams that participated, but did not place in the top 23 will receive 1 point. Those points will be carried over to the individual-based National Championships where teams will continue to score points based on their individual athletes' performances.\n\nThe winner of the Collegiate Cup will have accrued the most total points between both events and be presented with the College Cup as the overall NCWA National Champions. Grand Canyon University was the first champion of the new format in 2014.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Championship Year !! Champion School !!

Men's Division I programs are athletic department funded or have met the NCWA's D-I criteria. Many of the Division I programs also offer athletic scholarships.  Men's Division II teams are broken into categories; Emerging Programs, that are developing into Division I teams, and Clubs that operate on campuses where there are established NCAA/NCAA/NJCAA Teams; few Division II schools are of the latter circumstance. Schools whose wrestling teams are competing in the NCWA during their school's transitional period are placed into Division I. Women's programs are any collegiate/post-seconday scholastic programs who also compete in the collegiate folkstyle ruleset. GoGreco programs have most of the same set-up as the men's and women's divisions with the exception that it is under a Greco-Roman ruleset. \n\nIn August 2010, the current two-division system was passed at that year's Vision Forum and implemented for the 2011 National Championships.\n\n=== Conferences ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
