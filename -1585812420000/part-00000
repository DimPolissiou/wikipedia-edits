They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.<ref name=\"History\" /> In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in [[seed funding]], and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1.<ref name=\"History\" /> After months at beta stage, the application launched in November 2009, exclusively on the App Store for the iPhone. Koum then hired a friend in [[Los Angeles]], Chris Peiffer, to develop a [[BlackBerry]] version, which arrived two months later.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nTo cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one.

They realized that to take the idea further, they'd need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\".

It is affiliated\nto the [[International Handball Federation]]\n(IHF).\n\nThe OCHF is administered by an executive\ncommittee elected annually by its members.\nThe OCHF members are the local governing\nHandball federations in countries within the\nOceania region that are also members of the\nIHF.\n\n==History==\nThe first '''Oceania Handball Federation''' (OHF) was founded on 9 July 1993, by Mr. [[Alexander Dimitric]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].\n\nIn 1994, the first ever Oceania Senior Men's and Women's Championships were held in the Australian Capital city of Canberra, at the Australian Institute of Sport. This inaugural event was played between New Zealand and Australia Senior Men's and Women's teams in which Australia prevailed in both. In 1995, the first ever Oceania Junior Championships were held for men and women (Porirua, New Zealand). Australia won the Junior Men's Championship and New Zealand won the Junior Women's Championships. Although these games were called Continental championships, only Australia and New Zealand took part in these early days.\n\nFrom 1998-2009, Mr. Vernon Winitana (New Zealand) was President of the Oceania Handball Federation. He was first elected to this position in December 1998 (Mittagong, NSW, Australia), then re-elected in May 2003 (Porirua, New Zealand). In 2000, Mr. Winitana joined the International Handball Federation and held the position of 'Vice-President', onbehalf of Oceania.\nBetween 1998-2008 much work and support was done to promote and grow the sport of Handball throughout the Pacific in order to grow the membership with other Pacific Nations. This was a requirement set by the IHF (that in order for Oceania to be fully recognized as a Continental Federation the IHF required 7 full members to join the OHF).   During this time, Olympic Solidarity programmes were held throughout the Pacific including: Australia (Mittagong, NSW), Samoa, Cook Islands and Vanuatu to name a few, early contact and work was also done in Fiji and Tonga.  The result of this work saw the Cook Islands and Samoa Handball Association's gained full membership of the IHF in 2000, shortly followed by Vanuatu. The Samoan Handball Association presented their first ever National Junior Women's team to compete at the Oceania Junior Championships in 1999, (Porirua, NZ) which was won by New Zealand.\n\nIn 2000 the IHF made big efforts to promote Handball in Oceania because of the upcoming Sydney Olympics which were held in 2000. The legendary coach [[Bengt Johansson (handball)|Bengt Johansson]] ([[Sweden]]) was sent to support on site, economic support was given, development aid granted and additional help sent wherever possible. [[Alex Gavrilovic]] from Handball Australia was the Olympic Handball Competition Manager at [[2000 Olympic Games]], [[Sydney]] and was pivotal in showcasing Handball in this region, to the World. This was a big highlight in the history of Handball in the Oceania region. Mr. Gavrilovic also went on to play the same role for Handball programme at the 2011 London Olympics.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 work continued to keep growing the membership of the Oceania Handball Federation to look at ways to include New Caledonia, Tahiti and Wallis and Futuna as 'Affiliate' members of the Oceania Handball Federation.  These countries were only able to gain 'Affiliate' membership status, as at that time the French Handball Federation had not formally released these countries from their membership, and there were considerable implications for these countries if they left the French Handball Federation and joined the OHF, therefore their 'Affiliate' status.\nIn 2003, the 'Affiliate' countries were invited to compete and participate in Oceania 'Pacific Cup'. Tahiti participated in their first-ever Oceania Handball event which was held (Porirua, New Zealand) and sponsored by the IHF. This was welcomed by the Oceania Handball in an attempt to broaden the participation numbers (as most events were still only Australia and NZ competing regularly).\n''Note: The French Handball Federation has had a long presence in the Pacific via their former / existing (colonies/associates/territories): Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Tahiti, Wallis & Futuna etc. these countries have enjoyed a handball history that pre-date's Australia and New Zealand's inclusion into the International Handball community.''\n\nIn 2003, Mr Sacha Dimitich (Australia) was acknowledged and recognized as a Life Member of the Oceania Handball Federation, for the hard work, dedication and commitment he had given to the sport of Handball in Oceania. From 2006 to 2008, Mr. Winitana in his capacity as IHF Continental Vice-President challenged and raised his concerns with the IHF Executive Council regarding funding and development resources that had been promised to the Oceania region, once they had fulfilled their obligations to the IHF to get 7 full members on board, among other matters. This unfortunately put him at odds with the IHF Executive Board, and in 2008 he was removed from the IHF, and the recognition of the NZ national Handball entity he represented (Handball NZ) was removed by the IHF and awarded to a newly formed entity called the 'New Zealand Handball Federation'.\nOne of the last acts of the Oceania Handball Federation before it was disbanded as at the 'Oceania Senior Men's Handball Championships' held in Wellington, NZ - the Oceania Handball Federation recognized Mama Keu Mitchell (Cook Islands Handball Association) as its Patron, and for her long term contributions to the sport.\n\nIn 2009, the Oceania Handball Federation was disbanded and was re-established on 21 April 2011 as '''Oceania Continent Handball Federation'''.

It is affiliated\nto the [[International Handball Federation]]\n(IHF).\n\nThe OCHF is administered by an executive\ncommittee elected annually by its members.\nThe OCHF members are the local governing\nHandball federations in countries within the\nOceania region that are also members of the\nIHF.\n\n==History==\nThe first '''Oceania Handball Federation''' (OHF) was founded on 9 July 1993, by Mr. [[Alexander Dimitric]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].\n\nIn 1994, the first ever Oceania Senior Men's and Women's Championships were held in the Australian Capital city of Canberra, at the Australian Institute of Sport. This inaugural event was played between New Zealand and Australia Senior Men's and Women's teams in which Australia prevailed in both. In 1995, the first ever Oceania Junior Championships were held for men and women (Porirua, New Zealand). Australia won the Junior Men's Championship and New Zealand won the Junior Women's Championships. Although these games were called Continental championships, only Australia and New Zealand took part in these early days.\n\nFrom 1998-2009, Mr. Vernon Winitana (New Zealand) was President of the Oceania Handball Federation. He was first elected to this position in December 1998 (Mittagong, NSW, Australia), then re-elected in May 2003 (Porirua, New Zealand). In 2000, Mr. Winitana joined the International Handball Federation and held the position of 'Vice-President', onbehalf of Oceania.\nBetween 1998-2008 much work and support was done to promote and grow the sport of Handball throughout the Pacific in order to grow the membership with other Pacific Nations. This was a requirement set by the IHF (that in order for Oceania to be fully recognized as a Continental Federation the IHF required 7 full members to join the OHF).   During this time, Olympic Solidarity programmes were held throughout the Pacific including: Australia (Mittagong, NSW), Samoa, Cook Islands and Vanuatu to name a few, early contact and work was also done in Fiji and Tonga.  The result of this work saw the Cook Islands and Samoa Handball Association's gained full membership of the IHF in 2000, shortly followed by Vanuatu. The Samoan Handball Association presented their first ever National Junior Women's team to compete at the Oceania Junior Championships in 1999, (Porirua, NZ) which was won by New Zealand.\n\nIn 2000 the IHF made big efforts to promote Handball in Oceania because of the upcoming Sydney Olympics which were held in 2000. The legendary coach [[Bengt Johansson (handball)|Bengt Johansson]] ([[Sweden]]) was sent to support on site, economic support was given, development aid granted and additional help sent wherever possible. [[Alex Gavrilovic]] from Handball Australia was the Olympic Handball Competition Manager at [[2000 Olympic Games]], [[Sydney]] and was pivotal in showcasing Handball in this region, to the World. This was a big highlight in the history of Handball in the Oceania region. Mr. Gavrilovic also went on to play the same role for Handball programme at the 2011 London Olympics.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2003 work continued to keep growing the membership of the Oceania Handball Federation to look at ways to include New Caledonia, Tahiti and Wallis and Futuna as 'Affiliate' members of the Oceania Handball Federation.  These countries were only able to gain 'Affiliate' membership status, as at that time the French Handball Federation had not formally released these countries from their membership, and there were considerable implications for these countries if they left the French Handball Federation and joined the OHF, therefore their 'Affiliate' status.\nIn 2003, the 'Affiliate' countries were invited to compete and participate in Oceania 'Pacific Cup'. Tahiti participated in their first-ever Oceania Handball event which was held (Porirua, New Zealand) and sponsored by the IHF. This was welcomed by the Oceania Handball in an attempt to broaden the participation numbers (as most events were still only Australia and NZ competing regularly).\n''Note: The French Handball Federation has had a long presence in the Pacific via their former / existing (colonies/associates/territories): Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Tahiti, Wallis & Futuna etc. these countries have enjoyed a handball history that pre-date's Australia and New Zealand's inclusion into the International Handball community.''\n\nIn 2003, Mr Sacha Dimitich (Australia) was acknowledged and recognized as a Life Member of the Oceania Handball Federation, for the hard work, dedication and commitment he had given to the sport of Handball in Oceania. From 2006 to 2008, Mr. Winitana in his capacity as IHF Continental Vice-President challenged and raised his concerns with the IHF Executive Council regarding funding and development resources that had been promised to the Oceania region, once they had fulfilled their obligations to the IHF to get 7 full members on board, among other matters. This unfortunately put him at odds with the IHF Executive Board, and in 2008 he was removed from the IHF, and the recognition of the NZ national Handball entity he represented (Handball NZ) was removed by the IHF and awarded to a newly formed entity called the 'New Zealand Handball Federation'.\nOne of the last acts of the Oceania Handball Federation before it was disbanded as at the 'Oceania Senior Men's Handball Championships' held in Wellington, NZ - the Oceania Handball Federation recognized Mama Keu Mitchell (Cook Islands Handball Association) as its Patron, and for her long term contributions to the sport.\n\nIn 2009, the Oceania Handball Federation was disbanded and was re-established on 21 April 2011 as '''Oceania Continent Handball Federation'''. [[Paul Smith (Handball)|Paul Smith]] (Handball Australia) was elected as President and every year the member federations are re-electing the executive committee.\n\n==OCHF Presidents==\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" align=\"center\" \n!S.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], there were 3.4 million [[Filipino American]]s, including [[Multiracial American]]s who were part Filipino living in the US; in 2011 the [[United States Department of State]] estimating the population at four million. Filipino Americans constitute the second-largest population of [[Asian American]]s, and the largest population of [[Overseas Filipinos]].\n\nThe first recorded presence of Filipinos in what is now the United States dates to October 1587, with the first permanent settlement of Filipinos in present-day [[Louisiana]] in 1763. Migration of significant numbers of Filipinos to the United States did not occur until the early 20th century, when the Philippines was an overseas territory of the United States. After World War II, and until 1965, migration of Filipinos to the United States was reduced limited to primarily military and medically connected immigration. Since 1965, due to changes in immigration policy, the population of Filipino Americans has expanded significantly.\n\nFilipino Americans can be found throughout the United States, especially in the [[Western United States]] and metropolitan areas. In California, Filipinos were initially concentrated in its Central Valley, especially in Stockton, but later shifted to Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area. Other states with significant populations of Filipinos include: Hawaii, Illinois, Texas, and Washington. New Jersey and the New York Metropolitan area also has a significant population of Filipinos. There are smaller populations of Filipino Americans elsewhere.\n\nAs a population, Filipino Americans are multilingual, with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] being the largest non-English language being spoken. A majority of Filipino Americans are [[Christianity in the United States|Christian]], with smaller populations having other religious views. On average, Filipino Americans earn a higher average household income and achieve a higher level of education than the national average.\n\n==National population demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n\n|type=USA\n|1910|160\n|1920|5603\n|1930|45208\n|1940|45563\n|1950|61636\n|1960|176310\n|1970|343060\n|1980|774652\n|1990|1406770\n|2000|2364815\n|2010|3416840\n|source      =<br />\n*<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/appC.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327164259/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/appC.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 March 2010 |title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States |author=Campbell Gibson |author2=Kay Jung |date=September 2002 |work=Population Division |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=22 December 2014 }}</ref> \n*<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-16.pdf |title=The Asian Population: 2000 |author=Jessica S.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], there were 3.4 million [[Filipino American]]s, including [[Multiracial American]]s who were part Filipino living in the US; in 2011 the [[United States Department of State]] estimating the population at four million. Filipino Americans constitute the second-largest population of [[Asian American]]s, and the largest population of [[Overseas Filipinos]].\n\nThe first recorded presence of Filipinos in what is now the United States dates to October 1587, with the first permanent settlement of Filipinos in present-day [[Louisiana]] in 1763. Migration of significant numbers of Filipinos to the United States did not occur until the early 20th century, when the Philippines was an overseas territory of the United States. After World War II, and until 1965, migration of Filipinos to the United States was reduced limited to primarily military and medically connected immigration. Since 1965, due to changes in immigration policy, the population of Filipino Americans has expanded significantly.\n\nFilipino Americans can be found throughout the United States, especially in the [[Western United States]] and metropolitan areas. In California, Filipinos were initially concentrated in its Central Valley, especially in Stockton, but later shifted to Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area. Other states with significant populations of Filipinos include: Hawaii, Illinois, Texas, and Washington. New Jersey and the New York Metropolitan area also has a significant population of Filipinos. There are smaller populations of Filipino Americans elsewhere.\n\nAs a population, Filipino Americans are multilingual, with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] being the largest non-English language being spoken. A majority of Filipino Americans are [[Christianity in the United States|Christian]], with smaller populations having other religious views. On average, Filipino Americans earn a higher average household income and achieve a higher level of education than the national average.\n\n==National population demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n\n|type=USA\n|1910|160\n|1920|5603\n|1930|45208\n|1940|45563\n|1950|61636\n|1960|176310\n|1970|343060\n|1980|774652\n|1990|1406770\n|2000|2364815\n|2010|3416840\n|source      =<br />\n*<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/appC.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327164259/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/appC.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 March 2010 |title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States |author=Campbell Gibson |author2=Kay Jung |date=September 2002 |work=Population Division |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=22 December 2014 }}</ref> \n*<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/c2kbr01-16.pdf |title=The Asian Population: 2000 |author=Jessica S.

It was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1907 by W. F. Oakes. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1463>{{cite NSW SHR|5051363|Colemans Bridge over Leycester Creek|hr=01463|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n===Colemans Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was built in 1907 by [[Sydney]] contractor W.

In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Colemans Bridge has particular technical significance, having iron piers, the only two-lane Dare truss, footways, and long spans. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Colemans Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nColemans Bridge over Leycester Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible. In the context of its landscape it is visually attractive. As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\". Through this, the complete set of bridges gain some social significance, as they could be said to be held in reasonable esteem by many travellers in NSW.

In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Colemans Bridge has particular technical significance, having iron piers, the only two-lane Dare truss, footways, and long spans. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Colemans Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nColemans Bridge over Leycester Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

As such, the bridge has moderate aesthetic significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nTimber truss bridges are prominent to road travellers, and NSW has in the past been referred to as the \"timber truss bridge state\".

They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.

[[Wakool River]], connecting [[Mallan, New South Wales|Mallan]] and [[Dilpurra, New South Wales|Dilpurra]], both in the [[Murray River Council]] local government area, in the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]], Australia. The bridge was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1929. The bridge is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]] and was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1464>{{cite NSW SHR|5051366|Coonamit Bridge over Wakool River|hr=01464|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTimber [[Truss bridge|truss]] road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials.<ref name=\"nswshr-1464\" /> The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1464/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1464/>\n\nTimber truss bridges and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travelers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1464/>\n\n== Description ==\nCoonamit Bridge is a Dare type timber truss road bridge. It has two timber truss [[Span (architecture)|spans]], each of {{convert|28.2|m}}. There are five approach spans at one end and two at the other, giving the bridge an overall length of {{convert|128|m}}. The superstructure is supported by timber trestles and provides a carriage way with a minimum width of {{convert|5.5|m}}. The guard rail is of timber post and rail construction and extends the full length of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-1464/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\n2018, the physical condition is good and intact.<ref name=nswshr-1464/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe Coonamit Bridge is a Dare type timber truss bridge that was completed in 1929.
