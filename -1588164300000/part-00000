This dialogue opens with the normal liturgical greeting, \"The Lord be with you\", but in view of the special solemnity of the rite now beginning, the priest then exhorts the faithful: \"Lift up your hearts.\" The faithful respond with: \"We lift them up to the Lord.\" The priest then introduces the great theme of \"Eucharist\", a word originating in the Greek word for giving thanks: \"Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\" The faithful join in this sentiment, saying: \"It is right and just.\"\n\nThe priest continues with one of many thematic Eucharistic Prayer prefaces, which lead to the [[Sanctus]] acclamation: \"Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.

Do this in memory of me.\"<ref>{{Bibleverse||Luke|22:19}}; {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|11:24-25}}</ref> In many places, a consecrated bell is rung after the elevation of each element. The tradition of raising the host and chalice high after the [[Consecration]] has its origin in the [[ad orientem]] celebration of the Mass, and is done so that the people may more readily see the Host. It is also customary on solemnities and other days for the altar servers to offer incense to the Host and chalice during the elevation. The priest then announces: \"The mystery of faith,\" and the faithful respond with an [[Memorial Acclamation|acclamation]], using one of three prescribed formulae.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 151</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mass at Lourdes.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Mass at the Grotto at [[Lourdes]]. The chalice is displayed to the faithful immediately after the consecration of the wine.]]\nThe Eucharistic Prayer includes the [[Epiclesis]] (which since early Christian times the Eastern churches have seen as the climax of the Consecration), praying  that the Holy Spirit might transform the elements of bread and wine and thereby the people into one body in Christ.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 79c,f</ref> The whole portion of the Antiphon recalling Christ's passion, death, and resurrection, is called the [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|Anamnesis]].\n\nIntercessions for both the living and the souls in [[Purgatory]] follow. When there are priests concelebrating the Mass they join the main celebrant in the central prayers, up to the intercessions, which they may divide among themselves.\n\nThe Antiphon ends with an emphatic [[doxology]] for which the priest elevates the paten with the Host and the deacon (if there is one) elevates the chalice, and the priest(s) proclaim of Christ that \"through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy spirit, all glory and honor is yours, Almighty Father, for ever and ever,\" to which the faithful sing or chant the great Amen. This Amen is the faithful's assent to all that God has wrought through the consecration and re-presention of the sacrifice of Christ.\n\nBoth the doxology and Great Amen are preferably sung or chanted. This is in line with the ''Instruction on Music in the Liturgy'' which says: \"One cannot find anything more religious and more joyful in sacred celebrations than a whole congregation expressing its faith and devotion in song. Therefore the active participation of the whole people, which is shown in singing, is to be carefully promoted. ...It should first of all include acclamations, responses to the greetings of the priest and ministers and to the prayers of litany form, and also antiphons and psalms, refrains or repeated responses, hymns and canticles.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_instr_19670305_musicam-sacram_en.html|title=Musicam sacram|website=www.vatican.va|at=16|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>{{Roman Catholicism}}\n\n===Communion rite{{anchor|Communion rite}}===<!-- There are links to this heading -->\nAll together recite or sing the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\" (\"Pater Noster\" or \"Our Father\").

After praying: \"Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: Peace I leave you, my peace I give you;<ref>John 14:27</ref> look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will.  Who live and reign for ever and ever,\" the priest wishes the faithful the peace of Christ: \"The peace of the Lord be with you always.\" The deacon or, in his absence, the priest may then invite those present to offer each other the sign of peace. The form of the sign of peace varies according to local custom for a respectful greeting (for instance, a handshake or a bow between strangers, or a kiss/hug between family members).\n\nThe priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling. Covering this action the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" (\"[[Agnus Dei]]\" in Latin) is sung or recited,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 83</ref>\n\nIf [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]] are required, they may come forward at this time, and approach the altar itself after the priest has received Communion.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 162</ref> The priest then presents the Eucharistic Bread to the congregation, saying: \"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those who are called to the supper of the Lamb.\"<ref>[Rev 19:9]</ref> Then all repeat: \"Lord, I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed,\"<ref>Mat 8:8</ref> which is a reference in the Gospel of Matthew to where a Roman centurion manifests exemplary faith in Jesus to heal his servant, saying that Jesus' word alone was sufficient.

By long tradition and liturgical law, Mass is not celebrated at any time on [[Good Friday]], but rather the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord (with hosts consecrated at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday). Nor may Mass on [[Holy Saturday]] be celebrated before the [[Easter Vigil]] (the beginning of the celebration of Easter Sunday, which is customarily begun only after sunset, completing the [[Easter Triduum]] which began on Thursday).\n\nPriests are required to celebrate Mass frequently and are earnestly recommended to do so daily.<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref> However, \"apart from those cases in which the law allows him to celebrate or concelebrate the Eucharist a number of times on the same day, a priest may not celebrate more than once a day,\"<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\"/> and \"a priest may not celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice without the participation of at least one of the faithful, unless there is a good and reasonable cause for doing so.\"<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\"/> <!-- This note seems unnecessary, especially since it pertains mostly to the pre-Vatican II practice.

The bishop of a diocese<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1E.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref> and the pastor of a parish<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P1U.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref> are required to celebrate or arrange for another priest to celebrate on every Sunday or [[Holy Day of Obligation]], a Mass \"pro populo\" \u2013 that is, for the faithful entrusted to his care.\n\nFor Latin Rite priests, there are a few general exceptions to the limitation to celebrate only one Mass a day.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 204</ref> By tradition, they may celebrate Mass three times on Christmas Day (the Midnight Mass or \"Mass of the Angels\", the Dawn Mass or \"Shepherd's Mass\", and the Day Mass or \"Mass of the Divine Word\", each of which has its own readings and chants).\n\nOn [[All Souls' Day]] they may also, on the basis of a privilege to all priests by [[Pope Benedict XV]] in August 1915, celebrate Mass three times; only one of the three Masses may be for the personal intentions of the priest, while the other two Masses must be for all the faithful departed and for the intentions of the Pope. A priest who has concelebrated the Chrism Mass, which may be held on the morning of Holy Thursday, may also celebrate or concelebrate the Mass of the Lord's Supper that evening. A priest may celebrate or concelebrate both the Mass of the Easter Vigil and Mass of Easter Sunday (the Easter Vigil \"should not begin before nightfall; it should end before daybreak on Sunday\"; and may therefore take place at midnight or in the early hours of Easter morning). Finally, a priest who has concelebrated Mass at a meeting of priests or during a pastoral visitation by a bishop or a bishop's delegate, may celebrate a second Mass for the benefit of the laity.\n\nIn addition to these general permissions, the Local Ordinary may, for a good reason, permit priests to celebrate twice (they are then said to \"[[bination|binate]]\") on weekdays, and three times (\"trinate\" or \"trination\") on Sundays and Holy Days (canon 905 \u00a72). Examples would be if a parish priest were to need to celebrate the usual, scheduled daily Mass of a parish and a funeral later in the morning, or three Masses to accommodate all of the parishioners in a very populous parish on Sundays. In particularly difficult circumstances, the Pope can grant the diocesan bishop permission to give his priests faculties to trinate on weekdays and quadrinate on Sundays.\n\nIn many countries, the bishop's power to permit priests to celebrate two or three Masses on one day is widely used, and it is common for priests assigned to parish ministry to celebrate at least two Masses on any given Sunday, and two Masses on several other days of the week. Permission for four Masses on one day has been obtained in order to cope with large numbers of Catholics either in mission lands or where the ranks of priests are diminishing. This sometimes also happens in the case of historic churches which are unusually small compared to their number of parishioners, but which have not been replaced due to their historic character.\n[[File:Catholic Beach Mass Long Beach New York.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A Catholic beach Mass held in [[Long Beach, New York]].]]\n===Summary table regarding priests with pastoral responsibilities===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" width=40%\n|- bgcolor=#f9f9f9\n! width=\"70%\" | Situation\n! width=\"5%\" | Masses permitted\n! width=\"5%\" | Masses required*\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Normal weekday\n| 1\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Normal Sunday\n| 1\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Sunday, for just reasons**\n| 2\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| All Souls' Day\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Christmas Day***\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Weekday with permission of Local Ordinary\n| 2\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Sunday or Holy Day with permission of Local Ordinary\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Weekday with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary\n| 3\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|Sunday or Holy Day with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary\n| 4\n| 1\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> By any priest of a parish for the people; that is to say, individual priests are not required to say Masses on these days per se, but a Mass in each parish or oratory must be available for the people.<br>\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> According to the pastor's own judgment.<br>\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> By longstanding custom, this includes the First Mass of Christmas \"during the night\", even if it begins somewhat earlier than midnight.\n\n==Duration of the celebration==\nThe length of time that it takes to celebrate Mass varies considerably. While the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy is shorter than other liturgical rites, it may on solemn occasions \u2013 even apart from exceptional circumstances such as the [[Easter Vigil]] or an event such as ordinations \u2013 take over an hour and a half. The length of the [[homily]] is an obvious factor that contributes to the overall length. (On Wednesday 7 March 2018, during his weekly general audience in the Vatican's Paul VI Hall, continuing his catechesis on the liturgy, Pope Francis advised the clergy that homilies ought to last \u201cno more than 10 minutes\u201d). Other factors are the number of people receiving Communion and the number and length of the chants and other singing.\n\nFor most of the second millennium, before the twentieth century brought changes beginning with [[Pope Pius X]]'s encouragement of frequent Communion, the usual Mass was said exactly the same way whether people other than a server were present or not. No homily was given,<ref>Preaching was generally done outside Mass. The ''[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/rubrics/ Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae]'' of the Tridentine Missal mentions preaching at Mass only in connection with [[Solemn Mass]] (in section VI, 60) and only as a possibility.</ref> and most often only the priest himself received Communion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ellard|first=Gerald|title=Chapter XI: Sacrificial-Mindedness Largely Lost - and Found|url=http://jloughnan.tripod.com/ellard11.htm|work=CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WORSHIP|accessdate=November 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928215532/http://jloughnan.tripod.com/ellard11.htm|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Moral theologians gave their opinions on how much time the priest should dedicate to celebrating a Mass, a matter on which canon law and the Roman Missal were silent. One said that an hour should not be considered too long.  Several others that, in order to avoid tedium, Mass should last no more than half an hour; and in order to be said with due reverence, it should last no less than twenty minutes. Another theologian, who gave half an hour as the minimum time, considered that Mass could not be said in less than a quarter of an hour, an opinion supported by others, including Saint [[Alphonsus Liguori]] who said that any priest who finished Mass in less than that time could scarcely be excused from mortal sin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liguori|first=Alphonsus|title=Sacerdos Sanctificatus; or, Discourses on the Mass and Office|year=1846|pages=30\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTAEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=Jones, James|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Ritual Masses==\nA Mass celebrated in connection with a particular rite, such as an ordination, a wedding, or a profession of religious vows, may use texts provided in the \"Ritual Masses\" section of the Roman Missal.

The [[Late Latin]] word ''missa'' substantively corresponds to the [[classical Latin]] word ''missio''.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Liturgy of the Mass}}</ref> In antiquity, ''missa'' simply meant \"dismissal\".

This form, promulgated  by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1969 and revised by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2002, was introduced at the request of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) in succession to the [[Tridentine Mass]] promulgated in 1570 in accordance with decrees of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u201346). Use of the 1962 form of the Tridentine Mass is still permitted as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.  Celebrations in other [[Latin liturgical rites]] have been and still are used, as well as [[Eastern Christian]] forms of the [[Divine Liturgy]].\n\nThe ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC or ''Catechism'') produced in 1994 discusses the importance of the Mass in the Catholic tradition based on the whole history of the Mass and the understanding of it to that time. The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|United States Catholic Conference]] edition of the ''Catechism'' prefers to call the Mass the \"Eucharistic Celebration\", after its roots in the celebrational [[Last Supper]]. Under this topic in the Subject Index it lists as principal subtopics: commanded by Christ; center of the Church's life; memorial celebration; in the Church from the beginning; participation as Church precept; structure and movement.<ref>Vatican City: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1994, {{ISBN|1-55586-513-5}}.</ref>\n\n===Liturgical Texts===\nThe [[Roman Missal]] contains the [[prayer]]s, [[antiphon]]s and [[rubric]]s of the Mass. Earlier editions also contained the Scripture readings, which were then fewer in number. The latest edition of the Roman Missal contains the normal (\"ordinary\") form of Mass in the Roman Rite<ref>\"The Missal published by Paul VI and then republished in two subsequent editions by John Paul II, obviously is and continues to be the normal Form \u2013 the ''Forma ordinaria'' \u2013 of the Eucharistic Liturgy\" [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict to the Bishops, 7 July 2007], paragraph 5</ref> and the 1962 edition the [[Tridentine Mass]] which, in the circumstances indicated in the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', may be celebrated as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite.\n\nThe [[Lectionary]] presents passages from the [[Bible]] arranged in the order for reading at each day's Mass. Compared with the scripture readings in the pre-1970 Missal, the modern Lectionary contains a much wider variety of passages, too many to include in the Missal. A [[Gospel Book|Book of the Gospels]], also called the Evangeliary,<ref>General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM), paragraph 44</ref> is recommended for the [[Gospel (liturgy)|reading from the Gospels]], but where this book is not available the Lectionary is used in its place.\n\n==Structure of Mass==\n{{Roman Rite of Mass}}\n{{For|earlier forms|Pre-Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Mass}}\n\nThe Eucharistic celebration is \"one single act of worship\" but consists of different elements, which always include \"the proclamation of the Word of God; thanksgiving to God the Father for all his benefits, above all the gift of his Son; the consecration of bread and wine, which signifies also our own transformation into the body of Christ;<ref>1 Corinthians 10:17</ref> and participation in the liturgical banquet by receiving the Lord's body and blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P44.HTM|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref>\n\nWithin the fixed structure of the Roman-Rite Mass outlined below, the \"proper\" or daily-varying parts are the Scripture readings and [[responsorial psalm]], the [[antiphon]]s at the entrance and communion processions, and the texts of the three prayers known as the [[collect]], the prayer over the gifts, and the post-communion prayer. These convey themes from the liturgical season, the feast days of titles or events in the life of Christ, the feast days and commemorations of the saints, or for Masses for particular circumstances (e.g., funeral Masses, Masses for the celebration of Confirmation, Masses for peace, to begin the academic year, etc.).\n\nThe easiest way to determine the type of form the Mass will take is the positioning of the priest and the language.  The Tridentine form is almost universally, though not obligatorily, celebrated with the priest facing ''[[ad orientem]]'' and must be in Latin, while in the post-Vatican II form the priest generally, though again not obligatorily, faces ''[[versus populum]]'' and uses the language of the people taking part.\n\n===Introit, Procession, and Introductory Rites===\nThe [[Priest (Catholic Church)|priest]] enters in procession into the [[nave]] with altar servers, and with a [[deacon]] if there is one. The deacon may carry the [[Gospel Book|Evangelion]] (Gospel book), which he will place on the [[altar]]; and one altar server, called the [[crucifer]], carries a [[processional cross]] at the front of the procession. Other servers may carry blessed candles, [[incense]] and a [[thurible]]. During this procession, ordinarily, the entrance chant or hymn is sung.<ref>\"The antiphon with its Psalm from the Graduale Romanum or the Graduale Simplex, or another chant ... whose text has been approved by the Conference of Bishops\". GIRM, paragraph 48</ref> If there is no singing at the entrance, the entrance antiphon is recited either by some or all of the faithful or by a lector; otherwise it is said by the priest himself.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 256</ref> When the procession arrives at the sanctuary, all bow toward the altar. The priest and other ordained ministers kiss the altar. Then, when the priest arrives at his chair, he leads the assembly in making the [[Sign of the Cross]], saying: \"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,\"<ref name=\"Order of Mass\">{{cite web|title=THE ORDER OF MASS|url=http://www.usccb.org/romanmissal/order-of-mass.pdf|publisher=International Committee on English in the Liturgy, Inc.|accessdate=November 19, 2011|year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Holy Mass|url=http://www.theworkofgod.org/devotns/euchrist/guide.htm|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref> to which the faithful answer: \"Amen.\" Then the priest \"signifies the presence of the Lord to the community gathered there by means of the Greeting. By this Greeting and the response of the faithful, the mystery of the Church gathered together is made manifest.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 50</ref> The greetings are derived from the [[Pauline epistles]].\n[[Image:Kapucijnenkerk.hoofdaltaar02.jpg|thumb|left|240px|High altar of the Capuchin church in [[Ostend]], [[Belgium]].]]\nThen the priest invites those present to take part in the [[Penitential Act]], of which the Missal proposes three forms, the first of which is the [[Confiteor]]. One form includes tropes acclaiming God's deeds on our behalf, and the priest has some freedom in formulating these. This is concluded with the priest's prayer of absolution, \"which, however, lacks the efficacy of the Sacrament of Penance.\"<ref name=\"GIRM, 51\">GIRM, paragraph 51</ref> It does absolve [[venial sins]], however. \"From time to time on Sundays, especially in Easter Time, instead of the customary Penitential Act, the blessing and sprinkling of water may take place as a reminder of Baptism.\"<ref name=\"GIRM, 51\"/> This ceremony, in which the congregation is cleansed with [[holy water]], is known as the [[Asperges]].\n\n\"After the Penitential Act, the [[Kyrie|Kyrie, Eleison]] (Lord, have mercy) is always begun, unless it has already been part of the Penitential Act. Since it is a chant by which the faithful acclaim the Lord and implore his mercy, it is usually executed by everyone, that is to say, with the faithful and the choir or [[cantor]] taking part in it.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 52</ref> The Kyrie may be sung or recited in the vernacular language or in the original [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref>''Roman Missal'', \"The Order of Mass\", 7</ref> It is the only portion of the Mass in Greek instead of Latin or Latinised Hebrew.\n\n\"The [[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria in Excelsis]] (Glory to God in the highest) is a most ancient and venerable hymn by which the Church, gathered in the [[Holy Spirit]], glorifies and entreats [[God the Father]] and the Lamb. ...It is sung or said on Sundays outside Advent and Lent, and also on Solemnities and Feasts, and at particular celebrations of a more solemn character.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 53</ref> The Gloria is omitted at [[requiem Mass]]es (funerals and Masses for the dead) on ordinary feast-days of [[Catholic Saint|saints]], weekdays, and [[Votive Mass]]es. It is also optional, in line with the perceived degree of solemnity of the occasion, at Ritual Masses such as those celebrated for Marriage (\"Nuptial Mass\"), [[Confirmation]] or [[Religious Profession]], at Masses on the Anniversary of Marriage or Religious Profession, and at Masses for Various Needs and Occasions.\n\n\"Next the Priest calls upon the people to pray and everybody, together with the Priest, observes a brief silence so that they may become aware of being in God\u2019s presence and may call to mind their intentions. Then the Priest pronounces the prayer usually called the \u201c[[Collect]]\u201d and through which the character of the celebration finds expression.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 54</ref>\n\n===Liturgy of the Word===\nOn Sundays and solemnities, three Scripture readings are given. On other days there are only two. If there are three readings, the first is from the [[Old Testament]] (a term wider than [[Hebrew Scriptures]], since it includes the [[Deuterocanonical Books]]), or the [[Acts of the Apostles]] during [[Eastertide]].  The first reading is followed by a [[Responsorial Psalm]], a complete [[Book of Psalms|Psalm]] or a sizeable portion of one. A [[Cantor (church)|cantor]], [[choir]] or lector leads, and the congregation sings or recites a refrain. \"That the people may be able to sing the Psalm response more readily, texts of some responses and Psalms have been chosen for the various seasons of the year or for the various categories of Saints. These may be used in place of the text corresponding to the reading whenever the Psalm is sung.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 61</ref> The second reading is from the [[New Testament]], typically from one of the [[Pauline epistles]]. The reader begins most reading with the introductory statement \"a reading from the Book of...\" or \"a reading from the Letter to...,\" and concludes each reading by proclaiming that the reading is \"the word of the Lord,\"; the congregation responds by saying \"Thanks be to God.\" The lector will usually be a scheduled volunteer from among the congregation; when two non-Gospel readings are given, they may be given by two different lectors or by one, according to local preference.\n[[File:Deacon Friel.jpg|240px|thumb|right]]\nThe final reading and high point of the Liturgy of the Word is the proclamation of the [[Gospel]]. This is preceded by the singing of the Gospel Acclamation, typically an [[Alleluia]] with a verse of Scripture, which may be omitted if not sung. Alleluia is replaced during [[Lent]] by a different acclamation of praise. All stand while the [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel]] is chanted or read by a [[deacon]] or, if none is available, by a priest. The reading is traditionally introduced with the phrase \"a reading from the Holy Gospel according to\" followed by the evangelist's name. To conclude the Gospel reading, the priest or deacon proclaims: \"The Gospel of the Lord\" and the faithful respond, \"Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.\" The priest or deacon then kisses the book.<ref>''Roman Missal'', \"The Order of Mass\", 16</ref> If a deacon participates, he reads the Gospel. If a deacon is not present, the celebrating priest or a concelebrant, if there is one, proclaims it.<ref>''Roman Missal'', \"The Order of Mass\", 14</ref>\n\nAt least on Sundays and [[Holy Days of Obligation]], a [[homily]], a [[Sermon (oration)|sermon]] that draws upon some aspect of the readings or of the liturgy, is then given. Ordinarily the priest celebrant himself gives the homily, but he may entrust it to a concelebrating priest or to the deacon, but never to a lay person. In particular cases and for a just cause, a bishop or priest who is present but cannot concelebrate may give the homily. On days other than Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, the homily, though not obligatory, is recommended.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 66</ref>\n\nOn Sundays and solemnities, all then profess their Christian faith by reciting or singing the [[Nicene Creed]] or, especially from Easter to Pentecost, the [[Apostles' Creed]], which is particularly associated with baptism and is often used in Masses for children.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word concludes with the Universal Prayer or Prayer of the Faithful. The priest begins it with a brief introduction, then a deacon, a cantor, or another lay person announces some intentions for prayer, to which the congregation responds with a short invocation such as \"Lord hear our prayer.\"  The priest concludes with a longer prayer.\n\n===Liturgy of the Eucharist===\n[[File:4200-20080119-0624UTC--nazareth-church-of-the-annunciation-grotto.jpg|thumb|right|Mass in the [[Basilica of the Annunciation|Grotto of the Annunciation]], Nazareth.]]\n\nThe linen [[Corporal (liturgy)|corporal]] is spread over the center of the altar, and the Liturgy of the Eucharist begins with the ceremonial placing on it of bread and wine. These may be brought to the [[altar]] in a procession, especially if Mass is celebrated with a large congregation.<ref>\"It is a praiseworthy practice for the bread and wine to be presented by the faithful.\" GIRM, paragraph 73</ref> The unleavened, wheat bread (in the tradition of the [[Latin Church]])<ref>GIRM, paragraph 320</ref> is placed on a [[paten]], and the wine (from grapes) is put in a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] and mixed with a little water, As the priest places each on the corporal, he says a silent prayer over each individually, which, if this rite is unaccompanied by singing, he is permitted to say aloud, in which case the congregation responds to each prayer with: \"Blessed be God forever.\" Then the priest washes his hands, \"a rite in which the desire for interior purification finds expression.\"<ref>GIRM, paragraph 76</ref>\n\nThe congregation, which has been seated during this preparatory rite, rises, and the priest gives an exhortation to pray: \"Pray, brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God, the almighty Father.\" The congregation responds: \"May the Lord accept the sacrifice at your hands, for the praise and glory of his name, for our good, and the good of all his holy Church.\" The priest then pronounces the variable prayer over the gifts.\n\nThe [[Anaphora (liturgy)|Eucharistic Prayer]], \"the centre and high point of the entire celebration\",<ref>GIRM, paragraph 78</ref> then begins with a dialogue between priest and the faithful. This dialogue opens with the normal liturgical greeting, \"The Lord be with you\", but in view of the special solemnity of the rite now beginning, the priest then exhorts the faithful: \"Lift up your hearts.\" The faithful respond with: \"We lift them up to the Lord.\" The priest then introduces the great theme of \"Eucharist\", a word originating in the Greek word for giving thanks: \"Let us give thanks to the Lord, our God.\" The faithful join in this sentiment, saying: \"It is right and just.\"\n\nThe priest continues with one of many thematic Eucharistic Prayer prefaces, which lead to the [[Sanctus]] acclamation: \"Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God of hosts. Heaven and earth are full of your glory. Hosanna in the highest. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Hosanna in the highest.\"<ref>{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title=Sanctus from ''Missa de Angelis''|trans-title=12th century |medium=vimeo |language=Latin|url= https://vimeo.com/265820680|access-date=20 April 2018 |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location=Val\u00e8ncia |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn some countries, including the [[United States]], the faithful kneel immediately after the singing or recitation of the Sanctus.

The tradition of raising the host and chalice high after the [[Consecration]] has its origin in the [[ad orientem]] celebration of the Mass, and is done so that the people may more readily see the Host. It is also customary on solemnities and other days for the altar servers to offer incense to the Host and chalice during the elevation. The priest then announces: \"The mystery of faith,\" and the faithful respond with an [[Memorial Acclamation|acclamation]], using one of three prescribed formulae.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 151</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mass at Lourdes.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Mass at the Grotto at [[Lourdes]]. The chalice is displayed to the faithful immediately after the consecration of the wine.]]\nThe Eucharistic Prayer includes the [[Epiclesis]] (which since early Christian times the Eastern churches have seen as the climax of the Consecration), praying  that the Holy Spirit might transform the elements of bread and wine and thereby the people into one body in Christ.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 79c,f</ref> The whole portion of the Antiphon recalling Christ's passion, death, and resurrection, is called the [[Anamnesis (Christianity)|Anamnesis]].\n\nIntercessions for both the living and the souls in [[Purgatory]] follow. When there are priests concelebrating the Mass they join the main celebrant in the central prayers, up to the intercessions, which they may divide among themselves.\n\nThe Antiphon ends with an emphatic [[doxology]] for which the priest elevates the paten with the Host and the deacon (if there is one) elevates the chalice, and the priest(s) proclaim of Christ that \"through him, with him, in him, in the unity of the Holy spirit, all glory and honor is yours, Almighty Father, for ever and ever,\" to which the faithful sing or chant the great Amen. This Amen is the faithful's assent to all that God has wrought through the consecration and re-presention of the sacrifice of Christ.\n\nBoth the doxology and Great Amen are preferably sung or chanted. This is in line with the ''Instruction on Music in the Liturgy'' which says: \"One cannot find anything more religious and more joyful in sacred celebrations than a whole congregation expressing its faith and devotion in song. Therefore the active participation of the whole people, which is shown in singing, is to be carefully promoted. ...It should first of all include acclamations, responses to the greetings of the priest and ministers and to the prayers of litany form, and also antiphons and psalms, refrains or repeated responses, hymns and canticles.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_instr_19670305_musicam-sacram_en.html|title=Musicam sacram|website=www.vatican.va|at=16|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref>{{Roman Catholicism}}\n\n===Communion rite{{anchor|Communion rite}}===<!-- There are links to this heading -->\nAll together recite or sing the \"[[Lord's Prayer]]\" (\"Pater Noster\" or \"Our Father\").

After praying: \"Lord Jesus Christ, who said to your Apostles: Peace I leave you, my peace I give you;<ref>John 14:27</ref> look not on our sins, but on the faith of your Church, and graciously grant her peace and unity in accordance with your will.  Who live and reign for ever and ever,\" the priest wishes the faithful the peace of Christ: \"The peace of the Lord be with you always.\" The deacon or, in his absence, the priest may then invite those present to offer each other the sign of peace. The form of the sign of peace varies according to local custom for a respectful greeting (for instance, a handshake or a bow between strangers, or a kiss/hug between family members).\n\nThe priest breaks the host and places a piece in the main chalice; this is known as the rite of fraction and commingling. Covering this action the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" (\"[[Agnus Dei]]\" in Latin) is sung or recited,<ref>GIRM, paragraph 83</ref>\n\nIf [[extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion]] are required, they may come forward at this time, and approach the altar itself after the priest has received Communion.<ref>GIRM, paragraph 162</ref> The priest then presents the Eucharistic Bread to the congregation, saying: \"Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.

By long tradition and liturgical law, Mass is not celebrated at any time on [[Good Friday]], but rather the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord (with hosts consecrated at the Mass of the Lord's Supper on Holy Thursday). Nor may Mass on [[Holy Saturday]] be celebrated before the [[Easter Vigil]] (the beginning of the celebration of Easter Sunday, which is customarily begun only after sunset, completing the [[Easter Triduum]] which began on Thursday).\n\nPriests are required to celebrate Mass frequently and are earnestly recommended to do so daily.<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/_P38.HTM|title=Code of Canon Law - IntraText|website=www.vatican.va|access-date=2017-04-30}}</ref> However, \"apart from those cases in which the law allows him to celebrate or concelebrate the Eucharist a number of times on the same day, a priest may not celebrate more than once a day,\"<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\"/> and \"a priest may not celebrate the Eucharistic Sacrifice without the participation of at least one of the faithful, unless there is a good and reasonable cause for doing so.\"<ref name=\"Code of Canon Law - IntraText\"/> <!-- This note seems unnecessary, especially since it pertains mostly to the pre-Vatican II practice.

A priest who has concelebrated the Chrism Mass, which may be held on the morning of Holy Thursday, may also celebrate or concelebrate the Mass of the Lord's Supper that evening. A priest may celebrate or concelebrate both the Mass of the Easter Vigil and Mass of Easter Sunday (the Easter Vigil \"should not begin before nightfall; it should end before daybreak on Sunday\"; and may therefore take place at midnight or in the early hours of Easter morning). Finally, a priest who has concelebrated Mass at a meeting of priests or during a pastoral visitation by a bishop or a bishop's delegate, may celebrate a second Mass for the benefit of the laity.\n\nIn addition to these general permissions, the Local Ordinary may, for a good reason, permit priests to celebrate twice (they are then said to \"[[bination|binate]]\") on weekdays, and three times (\"trinate\" or \"trination\") on Sundays and Holy Days (canon 905 \u00a72). Examples would be if a parish priest were to need to celebrate the usual, scheduled daily Mass of a parish and a funeral later in the morning, or three Masses to accommodate all of the parishioners in a very populous parish on Sundays. In particularly difficult circumstances, the Pope can grant the diocesan bishop permission to give his priests faculties to trinate on weekdays and quadrinate on Sundays.\n\nIn many countries, the bishop's power to permit priests to celebrate two or three Masses on one day is widely used, and it is common for priests assigned to parish ministry to celebrate at least two Masses on any given Sunday, and two Masses on several other days of the week. Permission for four Masses on one day has been obtained in order to cope with large numbers of Catholics either in mission lands or where the ranks of priests are diminishing. This sometimes also happens in the case of historic churches which are unusually small compared to their number of parishioners, but which have not been replaced due to their historic character.\n[[File:Catholic Beach Mass Long Beach New York.jpg|thumb|right|500px|A Catholic beach Mass held in [[Long Beach, New York]].]]\n===Summary table regarding priests with pastoral responsibilities===\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" width=40%\n|- bgcolor=#f9f9f9\n! width=\"70%\" | Situation\n! width=\"5%\" | Masses permitted\n! width=\"5%\" | Masses required*\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Normal weekday\n| 1\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Normal Sunday\n| 1\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Sunday, for just reasons**\n| 2\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| All Souls' Day\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Christmas Day***\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Weekday with permission of Local Ordinary\n| 2\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Sunday or Holy Day with permission of Local Ordinary\n| 3\n| 1\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| Weekday with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary\n| 3\n| 0\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|Sunday or Holy Day with permission of the Pope through Local Ordinary\n| 4\n| 1\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> By any priest of a parish for the people; that is to say, individual priests are not required to say Masses on these days per se, but a Mass in each parish or oratory must be available for the people.<br>\n<nowiki>**</nowiki> According to the pastor's own judgment.<br>\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> By longstanding custom, this includes the First Mass of Christmas \"during the night\", even if it begins somewhat earlier than midnight.\n\n==Duration of the celebration==\nThe length of time that it takes to celebrate Mass varies considerably. While the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy is shorter than other liturgical rites, it may on solemn occasions \u2013 even apart from exceptional circumstances such as the [[Easter Vigil]] or an event such as ordinations \u2013 take over an hour and a half. The length of the [[homily]] is an obvious factor that contributes to the overall length. (On Wednesday 7 March 2018, during his weekly general audience in the Vatican's Paul VI Hall, continuing his catechesis on the liturgy, Pope Francis advised the clergy that homilies ought to last \u201cno more than 10 minutes\u201d). Other factors are the number of people receiving Communion and the number and length of the chants and other singing.\n\nFor most of the second millennium, before the twentieth century brought changes beginning with [[Pope Pius X]]'s encouragement of frequent Communion, the usual Mass was said exactly the same way whether people other than a server were present or not. No homily was given,<ref>Preaching was generally done outside Mass. The ''[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/rubrics/ Ritus servandus in celebratione Missae]'' of the Tridentine Missal mentions preaching at Mass only in connection with [[Solemn Mass]] (in section VI, 60) and only as a possibility.</ref> and most often only the priest himself received Communion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ellard|first=Gerald|title=Chapter XI: Sacrificial-Mindedness Largely Lost - and Found|url=http://jloughnan.tripod.com/ellard11.htm|work=CHRISTIAN LIFE AND WORSHIP|accessdate=November 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928215532/http://jloughnan.tripod.com/ellard11.htm|archive-date=September 28, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Moral theologians gave their opinions on how much time the priest should dedicate to celebrating a Mass, a matter on which canon law and the Roman Missal were silent. One said that an hour should not be considered too long.  Several others that, in order to avoid tedium, Mass should last no more than half an hour; and in order to be said with due reverence, it should last no less than twenty minutes. Another theologian, who gave half an hour as the minimum time, considered that Mass could not be said in less than a quarter of an hour, an opinion supported by others, including Saint [[Alphonsus Liguori]] who said that any priest who finished Mass in less than that time could scarcely be excused from mortal sin.<ref>{{cite book|last=Liguori|first=Alphonsus|title=Sacerdos Sanctificatus; or, Discourses on the Mass and Office|year=1846|pages=30\u201333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cTAEAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=Jones, James|accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Ritual Masses==\nA Mass celebrated in connection with a particular rite, such as an ordination, a wedding, or a profession of religious vows, may use texts provided in the \"Ritual Masses\" section of the Roman Missal.

The modding project was backed by the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]. Of these, ''Dear Esther'' became a [[cult hit]]. In 2009, Thechineseroom developed ''[[Korsakovia]]'', which was a [[survival horror]] mod.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/korsakovia-is-like-the-silent-hill-sequel-that-never-was-149967.phtml |title=Korsakovia is like the Silent Hill sequel that never was |first=Anthony |last=Burch |date=25 September 2009 |website=[[Destructoid]] |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151027105109/http://www.destructoid.com/korsakovia-is-like-the-silent-hill-sequel-that-never-was-149967.phtml |archive-date=27 October 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/09/21/an-esther-binge-korsakovia/ |title=An Esther Binge: Korsakovia |author=RPS |date=21 September 2009 |website=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723061332/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/09/21/an-esther-binge-korsakovia/ |archive-date=23 July 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Korsakovia'', Thechineseroom worked with Robert Briscoe to develop a remake of ''Dear Esther'', this time as a full-fledged video game title, distributed through [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]] distribution service. This stand-alone version of the mod received several IGF nominations, such as the Seamus McNally Grand Prize, Excellence in Visual Arts and Audio, and the Nuovo Award.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gamasutra.com/view/news/129726/Road_to_the_IGF_Thechineserooms_Dear_Esther.php |title=Road to the IGF: Thechineseroom's ''Dear Esther'' |first1=John |last1=Polson |first2=Lewie |last2=Procter |date=20 February 2012 |website=[[Gamasutra]] |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180909185456/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129726/Road_to_the_IGF_Thechineserooms_Dear_Esther.php |archive-date=9 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> It finally won for Excellence in Visual Art.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warpzoned.com/2012/03/independent-games-festival-announces-fourteenth-annual-awards-winners/ |title=Independent Games Festival announces fourteenth annual awards winners |first=Melissa |last=Niedringhaus |date=8 March 2012 |website=[[Warp Zoned]] |access-date=29 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913204315/http://www.warpzoned.com/2012/03/independent-games-festival-announces-fourteenth-annual-awards-winners/ |archive-date=13 September 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remake featured improved graphics, but was based on the same engine as the previous mods, [[Source engine|Source]].

This project was produced by the makers of the original game, [[Frictional Games]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115992-Frictional-Confirms-Amnesia-A-Machine-For-Pigs |title=Frictional Confirms ''Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs'' |first=Andy |last=Chalk |date=23 February 2012 |website=[[Escapist Magazine|The Escapist]] |access-date=28 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214143514/https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/115992-Frictional-Confirms-Amnesia-A-Machine-For-Pigs |archive-date=14 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThechineseroom also began work on their newest title, ''[[Everybody's Gone to the Rapture]]'' alongside the development of ''Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs''. During that time, on 11 June 2013, they renamed themselves from Thechineseroom to The Chinese Room, introducing a new logo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thechineseroom.co.uk/blog/welcome-to-the-new-us/ |title=Welcome to the New Us |first=Jessica |last=Curry |date=11 June 2013 |website=The Chinese Room |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619235045/http://thechineseroom.co.uk/blog/welcome-to-the-new-us/ |archive-date=19 June 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Initially developed on PC, the team was afraid it would not receive enough funding from fans.

They cited the lack of ability to pay their staff during the interim between projects as the reason for the closure, and expressed their intentions that the studio itself was still running without the development team, with Pinchbeck and Curry working on prototyping and acquiring funds on their own time. The company released a VR title, ''So Let Us Melt'', for Google Daydream in September, which was the final project of the former studio. Pinchbeck, Curry, and Andrew Crawshaw were working alone on the studio's next project, ''13th Interior'', which will push away from the \"walking simulator\" model the studio has been known for up to this point.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-25-the-doors-close-on-the-chinese-room-for-now |title=The doors close on The Chinese Room \u2013 for now |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=25 September 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2018, Sumo Group, the parent company of [[Sumo Digital]], acquired The Chinese Room for {{GBP|2.2&nbsp;million}}, making it the fourth UK-based studio under Sumo Digital. Co-founder Pinchbeck took the role of creative director for Sumo Digital, while Curry continued as an independent composer for The Chinese Room. Pinchbeck described the acquisition as \"the end of a chapter\" for the studio as they determined their next project.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-14-sumo-digital-acquires-the-chinese-room |title=Sumo Digital acquires The Chinese Room |first=Matthew |last=Handrahan |date=14 August 2018 |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]]}}</ref> From late summer 2018, The Chinese Room began re-staffing, adding veteran developers Ed Daly as studio director and John McCormack as art director.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-03-19-the-chinese-room-has-grown-10x-since-sumo-acquisition |title=The Chinese Room has grown 10x since Sumo acquisition |first=Matthew |last=Handrahan |date=19 March 2019 |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |access-date=28 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321141511/https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-03-19-the-chinese-room-has-grown-10x-since-sumo-acquisition |archive-date=21 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In March 2019, the studio announced ''Little Orpheus'' for [[Apple Arcade]].

His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him.

Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money.

She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him.

In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when other sex workers discuss working with another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, he has a breakdown and hits a classmate in the face before accepting Ji-soo's

He actually works as a security service provider for an [[Prostitution in South Korea|illegal prostitution business]] under the name \"Uncle\" with the help of Lee Whang-chul, also called \"Old Man\", who protects the sex workers and transfers the money to Ji-soo. His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price. Back at school, as Ji-soo is sleeping alone at his desk, Gyu-ri who noticed before that Ji-soo had another phone confirms what she previously saw. \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Episode 2\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri steals Ji-soo's business phone, finds the password and starts blackmailing him. Through the app, Gyu-ri accepts Min-hee's request to go to a client's room where she has a panic attack due to her [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] and requires Mr. Lee's help. Ji-soo starts tracking his second phone, having a violent encounter with Ki-tae \u2013 Min-hee's bully boyfriend \u2013 in the process, but Gyu-ri outsmarts him. Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money. She hides when Ji-soo's father sneaks into the apartment and accidentally discovers the money before stealing it. She chases him, in vain. In the street, Ji-soo sees his father fleeing with the money and discovers that Gyu-ri is the blackmailer. The following day, she tells her classmates that Ji-soo is her boyfriend in order to stop Ki-tae from bullying him. She takes Ji-soo to a baseball [[batting cage]] and shows off her muscly friends, offering him to recruit them to expand his business and make up for the loss of money.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Episode 3\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gyu-ri follows Ji-soo to Ulsan where they break into Ji-soo's father's house and search for the stolen money but find nothing. Gyu-ri argues that Ji-soo is a [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimp]] but he insists that he is only a security service provider and falls asleep after she refuses to explain why she needs money when her family is rich. In the morning, they catch Ji-soo's father and learn that he invested all the money in [[cryptocurrency]]. They witness as he looses more than 90% of the money and Ji-soo glares at a kitchen knife but restrains himself from stabbing his father. Back in Seoul, Ji-soo is struggling financially and cannot pay Mr. Lee who refuses to work until he receives his monthly payment. Mr. Lee tries to convince Min-hee to stop working but she refuses, and when other sex workers discuss working with another security service provider, Min-hee says she will only work with Mr. Lee who himself will only work with Uncle. Gyu-ri offers money to Ji-soo in exchange for a partnership in his business but he refuses. After failing his midterm exam, because he had to work part-time and was too mentally and physically exhausted to study, he has a breakdown and hits a classmate in the face before accepting Ji-soo's offer.\n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Episode 4\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Episode 5\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = Episode 6\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Episode 7\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Episode 8\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 9\n |Title           = Episode 9\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 10\n |Title           = Episode 10\n |DirectedBy      = Kim Jin-min\n |WrittenBy       = Jin Han-sae\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = \n |LineColor       = 000000\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe series is written by [[Song Ji-na]]'s son Jin Han-sae, directed by {{illm|Kim Jin-min|ko|\uae40\uc9c4\ubbfc (\uc5f0\ucd9c\uac00)}} (''[[Time Between Dog and Wolf]]'', ''[[Road No. 1]]'', ''[[Lawless Lawyer]]''), and produced by Studio 329, the same company behind [[YouTube Premium]]'s first and only Korean original series ''[[Top Management (TV series)|Top Management]]''.\n\n===Filming===\nFilming ended on August 6, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Park|first1=So-hee|url=https://entertain.v.daum.net/v/20190807164206994|date=August 7, 2019|work=Daum|title=\uae40\ub3d9\ud76c, '\uc778\uac04\uc218\uc5c5' \ucd2c\uc601 \ub05d \"\ud568\uaed8 \ud574\uc900 \uc2a4\ud15d\ub4e4 \uac10\uc0ac\ud574\uc694\"|language=ko|accessdate=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://www.netflix.com/title/80990668 Extracurricular]'' on [[Netflix]]\n* {{IMDb title|tt10262630}}\n* {{Hancinema drama|Human_Lessons}}\n\n{{Netflix original series}}\n\n[[Category:Korean-language Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:2020s South Korean television series]]\n[[Category:2020 South Korean television series debuts]]\n[[Category:Teen drama television series]]\n[[Category:South Korean crime television series]]\n[[Category:Prostitution in television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Seoul]]\n", "name_user": "Seokgjin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCo-starring", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracurricular_(TV_series)"}
