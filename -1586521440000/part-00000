Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936\u201358). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".\n\n==History of model==\nThe LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.\n\nIn addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.\n\n[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]\nFrom 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964\u201365), 340 (1966\u201367) and 350 (1968\u201376). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.\n\nFor most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.\n\nLeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.\n\n==First generation (1959\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:59 LeSabre 06-15-2019 Queen Street Cruise.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Buick LeSabre four-door hardtop\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1959\u20131960\n| related = [[Pontiac Catalina]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br>[[Buick Invicta]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br>[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Super 88]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Dynamic 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br>[[Pontiac Parisienne]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Star Chief]]<br>[[Pontiac Strato Chief]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Ventura]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />2-speed automatic\n| engine = {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n\n'''1959'''\n\nLeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959\u201360). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. \n[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]\nWhile Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.\n\n'''1960'''\n[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]\nThe 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".\n\nInside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.\n\n{{-}}\n{{anchor|second}}\n\n==Second generation (1961\u20131964)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name= Second generation\n | model_years    = 1961\u20131964\n | layout= [[FR layout]]\n|image='64 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg\n | engine={{unbulleted list | {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|''Small-Block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#364|''Nailhead'']] V8 | {{convert|401|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#401|''Nailhead'']] V8 }}\n | body_style= 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | transmission= {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 2/3-speed automatic }}\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n'''1961'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]\nLeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.\n\nInside were revised instrument panels retaining the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106\u2013107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref>\n\nEngines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.<ref name=\"buick\"/>\n\n'''1962'''\n\nThe 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.\n\nUnder the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.\n\nInside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.\n\n'''1963'''\n[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]\nThe 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.\n\nInside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.\n\nThe same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.\n\n{{clear_left}}\n'''1964'''\n\n[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]\nMinor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>\n\nUnder the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.\n\nReplacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.\n\nInside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.\n\n==Third generation (1965\u20131970)==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop.jpg\n | caption = 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop\n | name= Third generation\n | model_years    = 1965\u20131970\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]] sedan\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#340|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] V8\n | transmission= 2-speed [[Super Turbine 300|ST-300]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|ST-400]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] automatic\n | wheelbase= \n |related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|layout=[[FR layout]]\n}}\n\n'''1965'''\n\nLeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].\n\nStarting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.\n\n[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nInteriors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963\u201364 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.\n\nDrivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.\n\nBuick's engine\u2013transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.\n\n'''1966'''\n[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]\nNew grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.\n\nUnder the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.\n\n'''1967'''\n[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-L\u00e9onard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]\n\nSomewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.\n\nEngine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.\n{{-}}\n'''1968'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.\n\nA new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.\n{{-}}\n'''1969'''\n[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]\nThe 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.\nInteriors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.\n\nAlso new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.\n\nPowertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.\n\n'''1970'''\n[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pi\u00e8ces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nOnly minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.\n\nBoth base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.\n\nTransmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.\n\nAt the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.\n\nFor the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.\n\nThe 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1971\u20131976)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1976 Buick LeSabre Custom.JPG\n | name= Fourth generation\n | model_years    = 1971\u20131976\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]]\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n | transmission= 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n | wheelbase= \n | length= \n | width= \n | height=\n |layout=[[FR layout]]\n | related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Centurion]]\n}}\n\n'''1971'''\n\nLike the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.\n\n[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]\nThe same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.\n\nThe new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\nHowever, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.\n\nAlso new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.\n\nInside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.\n\n'''1972'''\n[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]\nA revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.\n\nInterior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.\n\nBoth the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.\n\nInside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.\n\n'''1973'''\n[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]\nA larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.\n\nThe LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.\n\n'''1974'''\n[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]\nNew grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.\n\nInside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.\n\nNew integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.\n\nWith the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.\n\nEngine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.\n\nNew options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.\n\n'''1975'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.\n\nEngine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.\n\nBodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.\n\nInside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.\n\nConvertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.\n\n'''1976'''\n\nOnly minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.\n\nThe '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.\n\n==Fifth generation (1977\u20131985)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1977 Buick LeSabre Custom Landau (17485350663).jpg\n | caption= 1977 Buick LeSabre Coupe\n | name= Fifth generation\n | model_years    = 1977\u20131985\n | body_style= 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | platform=[[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | layout=[[FR layout]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick]] V6<br />{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac]] V8<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LF9 Diesel|Oldsmobile]] Diesel V8<br />{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile]] V8\n | transmission= 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (THM-350 or THM-400) automatic<br />4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n | related= [[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br/>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Estate]]\n}}\n\n'''1977'''\n[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\n\nThe '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.\n\nAlthough the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.\n\n'''Size comparison between 1974 and 1984 Buick LeSabre sedans'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!\n!1974 Buick LeSabre\n!1984 Buick LeSabre\n|-\n|Wheelbase || {{Convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Overall Length || {{Convert|226.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|218.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width|| {{Convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|78.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height|| {{Convert|54.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Weight\n|4486&nbsp;lbs (2035&nbsp;kg)\n|3637&nbsp;lbs (1650&nbsp;kg)\n|-\n|Front Headroom|| {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|39.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Legroom|| {{Convert|42.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|42.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Hip Room|| {{Convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|64.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Headroom|| {{Convert|38.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Legroom\u2013ins.|| {{Convert|38.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Hip Room|| {{Convert|61.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|63.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Luggage Capacity|| {{Convert|19.7|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|20.8|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\n'''1978'''\nFollowing a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285&nbsp;lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.\n\n'''1979'''\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\nOnly minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.\n\n'''1980'''\n[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]\nNew sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977\u201379 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.\n\nEngine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.\n\n'''1981'''\n[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]\nOnly minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.\n\nThe three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.\n\nLeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.\n\n'''1982-83'''\n[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]\n\nFew changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.\n\n'''1984'''\n[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\nNew grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).\n\n'''1985'''\n\nThis would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992\u201396 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.\n{{-}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1986\u20131991)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1986 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n | caption = 1986 LeSabre sedan\n | name= Sixth generation\n | model_years=1986\u20131991\n | layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n | platform=[[GM H platform|H-body]]\n | engine= {{unbulleted list | 3.0&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN7|''LN7'']] [[V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LG2|''LG2/LG3'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN3|''LN3'']] V6 }}\n | wheelbase={{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length={{convert|196.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (Limited)\n | width={{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | assembly=[[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]\n | height={{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | body_style=2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n | related= [[Oldsmobile 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n | transmission= 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|4T60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n}}\n\nThe 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.\n\nMost Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substitution of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.\n\nIn 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.\n\nBeginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.\n\n<gallery widths=200px heights=120px>\nFile:'80s LeSabre Coupe.jpg|1987-1989 LeSabre coupe\nFile:Buick LeSabre Limited 1 -- 11-24-2009.jpg|1987\u20131989 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan\nFile:1988 Buick LeSabre T-type, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|1988 Buick LeSabre T-type coupe\nFile:1990-1991 Buick LeSabre -- 09-22-2010.jpg|1990\u20131991 Buick LeSabre sedan\nFile:1990-91 Buick LeSabre Custom, rear right.jpg|Rear view of 1990-1991 LeSabre Custom sedan\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1992\u20131999)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1992-96 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n| name = Seventh generation\n| production = 1991-June 1999\n| model_years = 1992\u20131999\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|''3800 Series I'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|''3800 Series II'']] V6 }}\n| designer = Bill Porter\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] automatic<br />4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|200.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)\n| height = {{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| assembly = Wentzville, Missouri United States\n| related = [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile 88/Regency/LSS]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n}}\nThis LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.\n\n[[File:1992 - 1996 Buick LeSabre Custom (rear).jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of 1994-96 Buick LeSabre]]\n[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]\nThe LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (305 [[N\u00b7m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThe LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.\n\nIn 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.\n\nFor 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.\n\n[[File:1998 Buick LeSabre Limited, Emerald Green, front right.jpg|left|thumb|Facelift Buick LeSabre Limited (1998)]]\n[[File:LeSabre Dash.JPG|thumb|Late '90s LeSabre dashboard]]\nThe LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.

It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.\n\nSome of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.\n\nIn 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16\" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.\n\nAmong other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.\n\nThe standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:\n* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])\n* Torque: 230 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (312 [[N\u00b7m]])\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Discontinuation==\nThe LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}<references/>\n* {{cite journal|title=Buick LeSabre|journal=[[Car and Driver]]|author=[[Patrick Bedard]]|issue=March 1992|pages=128\u2013129}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.lesabret.com/ Board Dedicated to 87-89 LeSabre T Types]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081120215246/http://www.lesabret-type.com/ Website containing information on the 86 LeSabre Grand National and 87-89 LeSabre T Type]\n* [http://www.zamiska.net/bltregistry/ The Buick Lesabre Grand National and T-type Registry]\n\n{{Buick Vehicles}}\n{{Buick postwar timeline}}\n{{Buick}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buick Lesabre}}\n[[Category:1960s cars]]\n[[Category:1970s cars]]\n[[Category:1980s cars]]\n[[Category:1990s cars]]\n[[Category:2000s cars]]\n[[Category:Buick vehicles|LeSabre]]\n[[Category:Convertibles]]\n[[Category:Coup\u00e9s]]\n[[Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Full-size vehicles]]\n[[Category:Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles]]\n[[Category:Sedans]]\n[[Category:Cars introduced in 1959]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=April 2019}}\n{{short description|Full-size car by General Motors}}\n{{Redir|LeSabre}}\n{{Infobox automobile\n|image=00-05 Buick LeSabre 1.jpg\n|caption = 2000 - 2005 Buick LeSabre\n|name=Buick LeSabre\n|manufacturer= [[General Motors]]\n| model_years    = 1959\u20132005\n|predecessor=[[Buick Special]]\n|successor=[[Buick Lucerne]]\n|class=Full-size car\n| layout    = {{ubl |[[FR layout]] (1959\u20131985) |[[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]] (1986\u20132005)}}\n}}\nThe '''Buick LeSabre''' was a [[full-size]] car made by General Motors from 1959 to 2005.  Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936\u201358). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".\n\n==History of model==\nThe LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.\n\nIn addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.\n\n[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]\nFrom 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964\u201365), 340 (1966\u201367) and 350 (1968\u201376). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.\n\nFor most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.\n\nLeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.\n\n==First generation (1959\u20131960)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = File:59 LeSabre 06-15-2019 Queen Street Cruise.jpg\n| caption = 1959 Buick LeSabre four-door hardtop\n| name = First generation\n| model_years = 1959\u20131960\n| related = [[Pontiac Catalina]]<br>[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br>[[Buick Invicta]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br>[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Super 88]]<br>[[Oldsmobile Dynamic 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br>[[Pontiac Parisienne]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Star Chief]]<br>[[Pontiac Strato Chief]] (Canada Only)<br>[[Pontiac Ventura]]\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| body_style = 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n| transmission = 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />2-speed automatic\n| engine = {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} {{convert|250|hp|abbr=on}} [[V8 engine|V8]]\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n\n'''1959'''\n\nLeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959\u201360). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. \n[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]\nWhile Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.\n\n'''1960'''\n[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]\nThe 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".\n\nInside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.\n\n{{-}}\n{{anchor|second}}\n\n==Second generation (1961\u20131964)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | name= Second generation\n | model_years    = 1961\u20131964\n | layout= [[FR layout]]\n|image='64 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Centropolis Laval '10).jpg\n | engine={{unbulleted list | {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|''Small-Block'']] [[V8 engine|V8]] | {{convert|364|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#364|''Nailhead'']] V8 | {{convert|401|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#401|''Nailhead'']] V8 }}\n | body_style= 2-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | transmission= {{unbulleted list | 3/4-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] | 2/3-speed automatic }}\n| platform = [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n}}\n'''1961'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]\nLeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal.

Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.\n\nUnder the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.\n\nInside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.\n\n'''1963'''\n[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]\nThe 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.\n\nInside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.\n\nThe same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.\n\n{{clear_left}}\n'''1964'''\n\n[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]\nMinor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>\n\nUnder the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.\n\nReplacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.\n\nInside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.\n\n==Third generation (1965\u20131970)==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop.jpg\n | caption = 1965 Buick LeSabre 4-door Hardtop\n | name= Third generation\n | model_years    = 1965\u20131970\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]] sedan\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|300|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#300|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|340|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#340|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] V8\n | transmission= 2-speed [[Super Turbine 300|ST-300]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|ST-400]] automatic<br />3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] automatic\n | wheelbase= \n |related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br>[[Chevrolet Biscayne]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|layout=[[FR layout]]\n}}\n\n'''1965'''\n\nLeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].\n\nStarting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.\n\n[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nInteriors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963\u201364 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.\n\nDrivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.\n\nBuick's engine\u2013transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.\n\n'''1966'''\n[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]\nNew grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.\n\nUnder the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.\n\n\n'''1967'''\n[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-L\u00e9onard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]\n\nSomewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.\n\nNew options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.\n\nEngine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.\n{{-}}\n'''1968'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.\n\nA new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.\n{{-}}\n'''1969'''\n[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]\nThe 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.\nInteriors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.\n\nAlso new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.\n\nPowertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.\n\n'''1970'''\n[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pi\u00e8ces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]\nOnly minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.\n\nBoth base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.\n\nTransmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.\n\nAt the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.\n\nFor the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.\n\nThe 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Fourth generation (1971\u20131976)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1976 Buick LeSabre Custom.JPG\n | name= Fourth generation\n | model_years    = 1971\u20131976\n | body_style= 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]<br />2-door [[hardtop]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br>4-door [[hardtop]]\n | platform= [[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n | transmission= 3-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n | wheelbase= \n | length= \n | width= \n | height=\n |layout=[[FR layout]]\n | related=[[Chevrolet Bel Air]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Centurion]]\n}}\n\n'''1971'''\n\nLike the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.\n\n[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]\nThe same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.\n\nThe new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.\n\nHowever, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.\n\nAlso new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.\n\nInside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.\n\n'''1972'''\n[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]\nA revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.\n\nInterior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.\n\nBoth the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.\n\nInside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.\n\n'''1973'''\n[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]\nA larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.\n\nThe LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.\n\n'''1974'''\n[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]\nNew grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.\n\nInside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.\n\nNew integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.\n\nWith the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.\n\nEngine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.\n\nNew options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.\n\n'''1975'''\n[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]\nThe upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.\n\nEngine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.\n\nBodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.\n\nInside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.\n\nConvertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.\n\n'''1976'''\n\nOnly minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.\n\nThe '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.\n\n==Fifth generation (1977\u20131985)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1977 Buick LeSabre Custom Landau (17485350663).jpg\n | caption= 1977 Buick LeSabre Coupe\n | name= Fifth generation\n | model_years    = 1977\u20131985\n | body_style= 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />4-door [[station wagon]]\n | platform=[[GM B platform|B-body]]\n | layout=[[FR layout]]\n | engine= {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]] [[V6]]<br />{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick]] V6<br />{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac]] V8<br />{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]] V8<br />{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#LF9 Diesel|Oldsmobile]] Diesel V8<br />{{convert|403|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#403|Oldsmobile]] V8\n | transmission= 3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (THM-350 or THM-400) automatic<br />4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n | related= [[Chevrolet Caprice]]<br />[[Chevrolet Impala]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]<br />[[Pontiac Catalina|Pontiac Catalina/Laurentian]]<br />[[Pontiac Parisienne]]<br />[[Pontiac Safari]]<br/>[[Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser]]<br />[[Oldsmobile 88]]<br />[[Buick Estate]]\n}}\n\n'''1977'''\n[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\n\nThe '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.\n\nAlthough the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.\n\n'''Size comparison between 1974 and 1984 Buick LeSabre sedans'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n!\n!1974 Buick LeSabre\n!1984 Buick LeSabre\n|-\n|Wheelbase || {{Convert|124.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|116.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Overall Length || {{Convert|226.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|218.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Width|| {{Convert|79.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|78.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Height|| {{Convert|54.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|56.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Weight\n|4486 lbs (2035 kg)\n|3637 lbs (1650 kg)\n|-\n|Front Headroom|| {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|39.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Legroom|| {{Convert|42.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|42.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Hip Room|| {{Convert|62.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Front Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|64.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Headroom|| {{Convert|38.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Legroom\u2013ins.|| {{Convert|38.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|38.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Hip Room|| {{Convert|61.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Rear Shoulder Room|| {{Convert|63.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|60.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|Luggage Capacity|| {{Convert|19.7|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}} || {{Convert|20.8|cuft|L|0|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\n'''1978'''\nFollowing a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285 lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.  \n\n'''1979'''\n[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]\nOnly minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.\n\n'''1980'''\n[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]\nNew sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977\u201379 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.\n\nEngine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.\n\nFollowing the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.\n\n'''1981'''\n[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]\nOnly minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.\n\nThe three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.\n\nLeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.\n\n'''1982-83'''\n[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]\n\nFew changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.\n\n'''1984'''\n[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]\nNew grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).\n\n'''1985'''\n\nThis would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992\u201396 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.\n{{-}}\n\n==Sixth generation (1986\u20131991)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n | image= 1986 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n | caption = 1986 LeSabre sedan\n | name= Sixth generation\n | model_years=1986\u20131991\n | layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n | platform=[[GM H platform|H-body]]\n | engine= {{unbulleted list | 3.0&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN7|''LN7'']] [[V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LG2|''LG2/LG3'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#LN3|''LN3'']] V6 }}\n | wheelbase={{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | length={{convert|196.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|197.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (Limited)\n | width={{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | assembly=[[Flint, Michigan]], [[United States]]\n | height={{convert|55.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n | body_style=2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n | related= [[Oldsmobile 88]]<br>[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n | transmission= 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic 125#Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4|4T60]] [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n}}\n\nThe 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.\n\nMost Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substition of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.\n\nIn 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.\n\nBeginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.\n\n<gallery widths=200px heights=120px>\nFile:'80s LeSabre Coupe.jpg|1987-1989 LeSabre coupe\nFile:Buick LeSabre Limited 1 -- 11-24-2009.jpg|1987\u20131989 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan\nFile:1988 Buick LeSabre T-type, front left (Hershey 2019).jpg|1988 Buick LeSabre T-type coupe\nFile:1990-1991 Buick LeSabre -- 09-22-2010.jpg|1990\u20131991 Buick LeSabre sedan\nFile:1990-91 Buick LeSabre Custom, rear right.jpg|Rear view of 1990-1991 LeSabre Custom sedan\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n==Seventh generation (1992\u20131999)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image = 1992-96 Buick LeSabre.jpg\n| name = Seventh generation\n| production = 1991-June 1999\n| model_years = 1992\u20131999\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = [[GM H platform (FWD)|H-body]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|''3800 Series I'']] [[V6 engine|V6]] | 3.8&nbsp;L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|''3800 Series II'']] V6 }}\n| designer = Bill Porter\n| transmission = 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]] automatic<br />4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|110.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|200.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|200.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| width = {{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|74.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)\n| height = {{convert|55.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1992\u201396)<br />{{convert|55.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)<br />{{convert|55.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (1997\u201399)\n| assembly = Wentzville, Missouri United States\n| related = [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile 88/Regency/LSS]]<br />[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n}}\nThis LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.\n\n[[File:1992 - 1996 Buick LeSabre Custom (rear).jpg|left|thumb|Rear view of 1994-96 Buick LeSabre]]\n[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]\nThe LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb\u00b7ft]] (305 [[N\u00b7m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThe LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.\n\nIn 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.\n\nFor 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.\n\n[[File:1998 Buick LeSabre Limited, Emerald Green, front right.jpg|left|thumb|Facelift Buick LeSabre Limited (1998)]]\n[[File:LeSabre Dash.JPG|thumb|Late '90s LeSabre dashboard]]\nThe LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.

Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.\n\nIn 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial.

The bridge connects [[Murray Downs]] in the [[Murray River Council]] local government area of New South Wales with McCallum Street in [[Swan Hill]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The bridge was built in 1896 and is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge is also called the '''Swan Hill Bridge''' and the '''Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1481>{{cite NSW SHR|5051385|Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|hr=01481|fn=H00/00311/1|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]], the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] named Swan Hill when he camped there in 1836 on the wide Murray Plain. Mitchell's head is today the crest of Swan Hill. This area was settled in the subsequent decade in very large stations: on the New South Wales side of the river, [[Murray Downs]] under Bell and Wilson covered {{convert|60000|ha}} and by the 1860s, under H. S. Officer, was carrying 6000 sheep. On the Victorian side, the principal runs were [[Tyntynder, Victoria|Tyntynder]] and Mercers Vale, established by the [[Beveridge, Victoria|Beveridge]] family as cattle stations. Because of this pastoral development a [[vehicle ferry|punt]] was installed at Swan Hill as early as 1846. In 1853, when the first two steamers on the river, the ''Lady Augusta'' and ''Mary Ann'' raced up the river, both stopped at Swan Hill and the Campbell family mounted a ball for the passengers and crew while their wool-clip was loaded. Swan Hill developed wharfage and in the 1860s had two hotels and three stores but only eleven houses. The town continued to develop as a crucial centre for the river trade, overlanding and interstate commerce, with hotels on both sides of the river adjacent to the punt.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThe Victorian railway reached Swan Hill in 1889 and the need for a bridge was more and more recognised. A [[vertical lift bridge|lift span]] bridge, allowing the passage of the river-boats, which were still numerous in this area, was planned in 1895 and opened in 1896. The bridge is still in use: Swan Hill, with good road, rail and water links, reached a population of 4,000 by 1948, remains the focus of a large area of diversified farming and attracts many tourists to its open-air museum.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== Description ==\nSwan Hill Bridge is a timber [[truss]], steel lift span bridge across the Murray River at Swan Hill. The main axis of the bridge is east - west. There are three main [[Span (architecture)|spans]] including one lift span supported on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. On the northern side there are three approach spans, and on the southern side there is one.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThe two main truss spans are {{convert|27.9|m|adj=on}} [[Allan truss]]es, with timber cross girders. The main stringers have been replaced with steel I-sections. The deck is timber.<ref name=nswshr-1481/> The {{convert|17.8|m|adj=on}} lift span superstructure is constructed with riveted [[Latticework|lattice]] steel. The lifting layout was also developed by [[Percy Allan]]. The deck of the lift span is also timber, and traffic is restricted to one lane across the lift span.<ref name=nswshr-1481/> The approach spans of {{convert|10.4|to|10.8|m}} timber girders supporting a timber deck. Piers are timber trestles, including the junctions with the main spans.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThere is a footway added on the upstream side, using steel beams. this has resulted in modification of the top chord stabilising angles to the Allan trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 23 June 2005, the bridge is described as being in fair condition as it has had major rehabilitation in recent years. One truss span was repaired in May 1998.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 23 June 2005, Swan Hill Bridge is significant under all four criteria - historical, aesthetic, technical, and social. The significance of the bridge lies in its form, setting and materials. The presence of the lift span is important. The appropriate level of significance in NSW is State and likely of national significance. The form and setting have high aesthetic and social significance. The superstructure construction - Allan timber trusses and Allan lift span have very high significance in the detail and materials. The bridge is the original of its type, and extremely rare (there is one other example at [[Tooleybuc]]).<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nSwan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge is historically very significant. It is hard to differentiate between historical and technical significance in this instance as they are closely intertwined. This bridge has great importance for its association with Percy Allan, who is respected as the outstanding bridge engineer in NSW. In his 46 years in the Public Service he designed over 550 bridges, including several outstanding structures. Swan Hill Bridge was one of his major works, and a significant advancement in technology. He was extremely proud of this bridge and prepared a technical paper on it. The bridge demonstrates a major step in the evolving pattern of our moveable bridge history.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge has aesthetic significance due to its outstanding setting and landmark qualities. The bridge provides a gateway to NSW from the major urban area of Swan Hill. It is a focus of the town to the river, which it dominates by its size and mass. The setting within the town of a lift bridge is rare, being only duplicated (with RTA bridges) at Tooleybuc.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge has high significance in the Swan Hill / [[Wakool]] District as the main urban link across the river and the focus of movements across the river, controlling access of people and commerce. The river is the centre of social and recreational region, and the Swan Hill Bridge is the centre of this area. It is considered an important element in the region by the local people, although there is concern at its perceived traffic inadequacies.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}\n*[[List of crossings of the Murray River]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|work=VisitNSW|date=2007|title=Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019583}}\n* {{cite web|work=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301080}}\n* {{cite book|first=W.

[[road bridge]] that carries Swan Hill Road across the [[Murray River]], on the border between [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Australia. The bridge connects [[Murray Downs]] in the [[Murray River Council]] local government area of New South Wales with McCallum Street in [[Swan Hill]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The bridge was built in 1896 and is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. The bridge is also called the '''Swan Hill Bridge''' and the '''Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge'''. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1481>{{cite NSW SHR|5051385|Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|hr=01481|fn=H00/00311/1|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Sir Thomas Mitchell]], the [[Surveyor General of New South Wales|Surveyor General]] named Swan Hill when he camped there in 1836 on the wide Murray Plain. Mitchell's head is today the crest of Swan Hill. This area was settled in the subsequent decade in very large stations: on the New South Wales side of the river, [[Murray Downs]] under Bell and Wilson covered {{convert|60000|ha}} and by the 1860s, under H. S. Officer, was carrying 6000 sheep. On the Victorian side, the principal runs were [[Tyntynder, Victoria|Tyntynder]] and Mercers Vale, established by the [[Beveridge, Victoria|Beveridge]] family as cattle stations. Because of this pastoral development a [[vehicle ferry|punt]] was installed at Swan Hill as early as 1846. In 1853, when the first two steamers on the river, the ''Lady Augusta'' and ''Mary Ann'' raced up the river, both stopped at Swan Hill and the Campbell family mounted a ball for the passengers and crew while their wool-clip was loaded. Swan Hill developed wharfage and in the 1860s had two hotels and three stores but only eleven houses. The town continued to develop as a crucial centre for the river trade, overlanding and interstate commerce, with hotels on both sides of the river adjacent to the punt.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThe Victorian railway reached Swan Hill in 1889 and the need for a bridge was more and more recognised. A [[vertical lift bridge|lift span]] bridge, allowing the passage of the river-boats, which were still numerous in this area, was planned in 1895 and opened in 1896. The bridge is still in use: Swan Hill, with good road, rail and water links, reached a population of 4,000 by 1948, remains the focus of a large area of diversified farming and attracts many tourists to its open-air museum.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== Description ==\nSwan Hill Bridge is a timber [[truss]], steel lift span bridge across the Murray River at Swan Hill. The main axis of the bridge is east - west. There are three main [[Span (architecture)|spans]] including one lift span supported on cast iron cylindrical [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. On the northern side there are three approach spans, and on the southern side there is one.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThe two main truss spans are {{convert|27.9|m|adj=on}} [[Allan truss]]es, with timber cross girders. The main stringers have been replaced with steel I-sections. The deck is timber.<ref name=nswshr-1481/> The {{convert|17.8|m|adj=on}} lift span superstructure is constructed with riveted [[Latticework|lattice]] steel. The lifting layout was also developed by [[Percy Allan]]. The deck of the lift span is also timber, and traffic is restricted to one lane across the lift span.<ref name=nswshr-1481/> The approach spans of {{convert|10.4|to|10.8|m}} timber girders supporting a timber deck. Piers are timber trestles, including the junctions with the main spans.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nThere is a footway added on the upstream side, using steel beams. this has resulted in modification of the top chord stabilising angles to the Allan trusses.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n\nAs at 23 June 2005, the bridge is described as being in fair condition as it has had major rehabilitation in recent years. One truss span was repaired in May 1998.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 23 June 2005, Swan Hill Bridge is significant under all four criteria - historical, aesthetic, technical, and social. The significance of the bridge lies in its form, setting and materials. The presence of the lift span is important. The appropriate level of significance in NSW is State and likely of national significance. The form and setting have high aesthetic and social significance. The superstructure construction - Allan timber trusses and Allan lift span have very high significance in the detail and materials. The bridge is the original of its type, and extremely rare (there is one other example at [[Tooleybuc]]).<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\nSwan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge is historically very significant. It is hard to differentiate between historical and technical significance in this instance as they are closely intertwined. This bridge has great importance for its association with Percy Allan, who is respected as the outstanding bridge engineer in NSW. In his 46 years in the Public Service he designed over 550 bridges, including several outstanding structures. Swan Hill Bridge was one of his major works, and a significant advancement in technology. He was extremely proud of this bridge and prepared a technical paper on it. The bridge demonstrates a major step in the evolving pattern of our moveable bridge history.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge has aesthetic significance due to its outstanding setting and landmark qualities. The bridge provides a gateway to NSW from the major urban area of Swan Hill. It is a focus of the town to the river, which it dominates by its size and mass. The setting within the town of a lift bridge is rare, being only duplicated (with RTA bridges) at Tooleybuc.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n'''The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe Swan Hill Bridge has high significance in the Swan Hill / [[Wakool]] District as the main urban link across the river and the focus of movements across the river, controlling access of people and commerce. The river is the centre of social and recreational region, and the Swan Hill Bridge is the centre of this area. It is considered an important element in the region by the local people, although there is concern at its perceived traffic inadequacies.<ref name=nswshr-1481/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|New South Wales|Transport|Engineering|Australian roads}}\n*[[List of crossings of the Murray River]]\n*[[List of bridges in Australia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite web|author=|work=VisitNSW|date=2007|title=Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|url=http://www.visitnsw.com.au/Operator.aspx?ProductId=9019583}}\n* {{cite web|work=Attraction Homepage|date=2007|title=Swan Hill-Murray River Road Bridge|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4301080}}\n* {{cite book|first=W.

Pinball|Pinball]] from Plus! for Windows 95.\n\n=== Networking technologies ===\n* Net Crawler: Windows Me introduced a net crawling feature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/276322|title=How to Disable Net Crawl Functionality|date=2007-01-29|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423121641/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/276322|archive-date=2008-04-23|url-status=dead|accessdate=2014-05-21}}</ref> which automatically searches out and creates shortcuts to network shares and printers in ''My Network Places''. This can be controlled using the ''Automatically search for network folders and printers'' option. Shortcuts that are added by the net crawler but not detected again on the network in a reasonable time period are aged out and deleted.\n* New [[TCP/IP]] Stack: Windows Me includes the [[Windows 2000]] networking stack and architecture<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/WinMe/maintain/netcomp.mspx?mfr=true|title=MS Windows Millennium Edition: Networking Components|website=[[Microsoft Technet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420173703/http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/WinME/maintain/netcomp.mspx?mfr=true|archive-date=2008-04-20|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref> which was known to be more reliable, full-featured, stable and offered better performance. Support for networking over [[FireWire]], improved [[Infrared Data Association|infrared]] support, a network diagnostic troubleshooter and a new Home Networking wizard are also included.\n* The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small [[home network]]. This includes setting up [[Internet Connection Sharing]] (ICS) on a computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a connection to the Internet with other computers on the home network.\n* [[Dial-up]] Networking component was updated in Windows Me, and provides several enhancements while maintaining the desired features of prior releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The user interface now included three new tabs: ''Networking'', ''Security'' and ''Dialing''. To improve dial-up networking, Windows Me includes built-in support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy dial-up networking connections, by means of a Connection Manager service profile, to Windows Me\u2013based client machines.\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) version 5.0 for Windows Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity with NDIS version 5.0 in Windows 2000. This means that the programming interfaces that the author of a network device driver uses are the same for both of these Windows platforms.\n* [[Universal Plug and Play]]: Windows Me introduced support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT traversal APIs can also be installed on [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows 98 SE]] by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa939488(WinEmbedded.5).aspx|title=Network Setup Wizard Down Level Setup|date=October 18, 2010|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== System utilities ===\n* [[System Restore]]: Windows Me introduced the \"System Restore\" logging and reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting and solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the [[Windows registry|registry]]. System Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a backup program.\n* [[System File Protection]]: First introduced with [[Windows 2000]] (as [[Windows File Protection]]), and expanding on the capabilities introduced with [[System File Checker]] in Windows 98, [[System File Protection]] aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows Me to silently restore the original copy. The original is taken from a hard drive backup folder (<code>%WinDir%\\Options\\Install</code>) or from the Windows Me installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. [[System File Protection]] is a different technology from [[System Restore]] and should not be confused with the latter. [[System Restore]] maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas [[System File Protection]] protects operating system files with no user input.\n* [[MSConfig|System Configuration Utility]] allows users to manually extract and restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files. It has also been updated with three new tabs called \"Static VxDs\", \"Environment\" and \"International\". The ''Static VxDs'' tab allows users to enable or disable static [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to be loaded at startup, the ''Environment'' tab allows users to enable or disable [[environment variable]]s, and the ''International'' tab allows users to set international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set via the real mode MS-DOS configuration files. A ''Cleanup'' button on the ''Startup'' tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries.\n* [[System Monitor]] has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section. Users can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes Received or Transmitted / Second.\n* [[SCANDISK]] runs from within Windows upon an improper shutdown before the [[Windows Shell]] loads.\n* [[Automatic Updates]]: The Automatic Updates utility automatically downloads and installs critical updates from the [[Windows Update]] Web site with little user interaction. It is set up to check Windows Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to download which update they want, although high-priority updates must be downloaded and installed.\n* Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes support for [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] files through a shell extension known as Compressed Folders. Originally introduced in the [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus! 98]] pack for Windows 98, this feature allows users to create, access and extract files from ZIP archives similar to a regular folder in Windows. The user can also restrict access to files with a password.\n* A new ''Help and Support'' program has also been added, replacing the [[HTML Help]]-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The Help and Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage of a technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that can show support information from the internet, allows collecting data for troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third parties to plug into Windows Help and Support.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/winme/bulk/oem/health/Support_Automation_Framework_56k/MS_Studio_PCHFest_Support_Automation_Framework.ppt Support Automation Framework]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Several other support tools also shipped with Windows Me.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=/servicedesks/webcasts/en/wc020101/wct020101.asp&sd=dell |title=Windows Millennium Edition support tools webcast |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>\n* Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a new Print Preview feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows/windows-millennium-edition-windows-me-beta-3-reviewed|title=Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) Beta 3 Reviewed|publisher=SuperSite for Windows|date=12 April 2000|accessdate=2014-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129115848/http://winsupersite.com/windows/windows-millennium-edition-windows-me-beta-3-reviewed|archive-date=2014-11-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> It also shipped with the [[MSN Messenger]] Service.\n\n=== Accessibility features ===\n* [[Virtual keyboard|On-Screen Keyboard]]: Originally introduced with Windows 2000, a program called On-Screen Keyboard has been added, which makes it possible to input characters using the mouse instead of the keyboard. This feature is useful for computers that use a [[Graphics tablet|tablet]] as the primary pointing device or for [[accessibility]] purposes.\n* The ''Mouse'' Control Panel incorporates [[IntelliPoint]] features, namely ClickLock (selecting or dragging without continuously holding down the mouse button), hiding the pointer while typing and showing it by pressing ''Ctrl''.\n* The cursor (system caret) can be set to a thicker width.\n* Increased [[Active Accessibility]] support in utilities such as [[Calculator (Windows)|Calculator]] and [[Magnifier (Windows)|Magnifier]].\n\n== Removed features ==\n\n=== Real mode DOS ===\nWindows Me restricted support for [[real mode]] [[MS-DOS]]. As a result, <code>[[IO.SYS]]</code> in Windows Me disregards <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code>, <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> and <code>[[WIN.COM]]</code> and directly executes <code>[[VMM32.VXD]]</code>. In its default configuration the system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as <code>[[ANSI.SYS]]</code> could not be loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot process.<ref name=\"realmode\" /><ref name=\"FastBoot1\" />\n\nIn Windows Me, the <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> files are used only to set global [[environment variable]]s. The two files (if present) are scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other commands present are removed into a Windows registry key (see below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the \"global environment\" for the computer during the boot phase or when starting a new [[virtual DOS machine]] (VDM).\n\nTo specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be present in the <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file) the user must edit the following Windows registry key:\n:<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SessionManager\\Environment</code>\n\nFor troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-createable floppy disk, known as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS.\n\nIt is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various unofficial means.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/10/21/windows_bugs_me_but/|title=Windows bugs Me \u2013 but a little less?|last=Escalante|first=Luis|date=2000-10-21|work=[[The Register]]|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multiboot.ru/msdos8.htm |title=Some features of MS-DOS 8.0 |publisher=Multiboot.ru |date= |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref> Additionally, a registry setting exists that re-enables the \"Restart in MS-DOS mode\" option in the [[shutdown (computing)|shutdown]] [[dialog box]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065618/http://www.aaanalyzer.addr.com/msdospolicies.html |title=Activity and Authentication Analyzer |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Other components ===\nUnlike past versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at home users, and thus had certain [[Enterprise software|enterprise]]-oriented features removed. Several features of its predecessors did not work or were officially unsupported by Microsoft on Windows Me, including Automated Installation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/250104|title=Automated Installation Support in Windows Me|date=2007-01-27|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504194711/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/250104|archive-date=2010-05-28|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref> [[Active Directory]] client services,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/276472|title=Directory Services Client Is Not Included with Windows Me|date=2007-01-29|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613133454/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/276472|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref> System Policy Editor,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/266271|title=The Policy Editor Tool Is Not Supported in Windows Millennium Edition|date=2007-01-27|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222182644/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/266271|archive-date=2009-02-22|url-status=dead|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> [[Microsoft Personal Web Server|Personal Web Server]] and [[Active Server Pages|ASP]].

Due to its many bugs and glitches, Windows Me is considered one of the worst operating systems of all time. A ''PC World'' article dubbed Windows Me the \"Mistake Edition\" and placed it 4th in their \"Worst Tech Products of All Time\" feature in 2006.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html?page=2|title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time|last=Tynan|first=Dan|date=May 26, 2006|website=[[PC World]]|access-date=July 23, 2019}}</ref> The article states: \"Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Consequently, most home users remained with [[Windows 98 Second Edition]], while some moved to [[Windows 2000]] despite the latter being enterprise-oriented.\n\nSystem Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001 incorrectly. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem.<ref name=\"Support.microsoft.com\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=290700|title=Checkpoints that you create after 8 September 2001 do not restore your computer|date=2007-10-26|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227181112/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=290700|archive-date=2013-02-27|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\nByron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system.

Image Preview supports images with .<code>BMP</code>, .<code>DIB</code>, .<code>EMF</code>, .<code>GIF</code>, .<code>JPEG</code>, .<code>PNG</code>, .<code>TIF</code> and .<code>WMF</code> file formats. The ''My Pictures'' folder also integrates previewing images.\n* Games: Windows Me includes version 7.1 of the [[DirectX]] API which introduced [[DirectPlay#DirectPlay Voice|DirectPlay Voice]], and also offers several new games: Internet Backgammon, Internet Checkers, Internet Hearts, Internet Reversi, Internet Spades. It also includes [[Spider Solitaire (Windows)|Spider Solitaire]] from Plus! 98 and [[Full Tilt!

Support for networking over [[FireWire]], improved [[Infrared Data Association|infrared]] support, a network diagnostic troubleshooter and a new Home Networking wizard are also included.\n* The Home Networking Wizard is designed to help users to set up a computer that is running Windows Me for use on a small [[home network]]. This includes setting up [[Internet Connection Sharing]] (ICS) on a computer running Windows Me so the computer can share a connection to the Internet with other computers on the home network.\n* [[Dial-up]] Networking component was updated in Windows Me, and provides several enhancements while maintaining the desired features of prior releases of the operating system. The user interface had been reworked to provide all configurable parameters in one convenient location. The user interface now included three new tabs: ''Networking'', ''Security'' and ''Dialing''. To improve dial-up networking, Windows Me includes built-in support for the Connection Manager dial-up client. Using the Connection Manager Administration Kit (an optional networking component in Windows 2000 Server), network administrators can pre-configure and deploy dial-up networking connections, by means of a Connection Manager service profile, to Windows Me\u2013based client machines.\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) version 5.0 for Windows Me was enhanced to provide programming interface parity with NDIS version 5.0 in Windows 2000. This means that the programming interfaces that the author of a network device driver uses are the same for both of these Windows platforms.\n* [[Universal Plug and Play]]: Windows Me introduced support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP). Universal Plug and Play and NAT traversal APIs can also be installed on [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows 98 SE]] by installing the Windows XP Network Setup Wizard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa939488(WinEmbedded.5).aspx|title=Network Setup Wizard Down Level Setup|date=October 18, 2010|website=[[Microsoft Developer Network]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=April 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== System utilities ===\n* [[System Restore]]: Windows Me introduced the \"System Restore\" logging and reversion system, which was meant to simplify troubleshooting and solve problems. It was intended to work as a rollback and recovery feature so that if the installation of an application or a driver adversely affected the system, the user could undo the installation and return the system to a previously working state. It does this by monitoring changes to Windows system files and the [[Windows registry|registry]]. System Restore protects only the operating system files, not documents, and therefore is not a substitute for a backup program.\n* [[System File Protection]]: First introduced with [[Windows 2000]] (as [[Windows File Protection]]), and expanding on the capabilities introduced with [[System File Checker]] in Windows 98, [[System File Protection]] aimed to protect system files from modification and corruption silently and automatically. When the file protection is in effect, replacing or deleting a system file causes Windows Me to silently restore the original copy. The original is taken from a hard drive backup folder (<code>%WinDir%\\Options\\Install</code>) or from the Windows Me installation CD, if the cached copy of files on the hard disk has been deleted. If no installation CD is in the drive, a dialog box alerts the user about the problem and requests that the CD be inserted. [[System File Protection]] is a different technology from [[System Restore]] and should not be confused with the latter. [[System Restore]] maintains a broad set of changed files including added applications and user configuration data stored repeatedly at specific points in time restored by the user, whereas [[System File Protection]] protects operating system files with no user input.\n* [[MSConfig|System Configuration Utility]] allows users to manually extract and restore individual system files from the Windows Me setup files. It has also been updated with three new tabs called \"Static VxDs\", \"Environment\" and \"International\". The ''Static VxDs'' tab allows users to enable or disable static [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to be loaded at startup, the ''Environment'' tab allows users to enable or disable [[environment variable]]s, and the ''International'' tab allows users to set international language keyboard layout settings that were formerly set via the real mode MS-DOS configuration files. A ''Cleanup'' button on the ''Startup'' tab allows cleaning up invalid or deleted startup entries.\n* [[System Monitor]] has been updated with a Dial-Up Adapter section. Users can now monitor items such as Connection Speeds, Bytes Received or Transmitted / Second.\n* [[SCANDISK]] runs from within Windows upon an improper shutdown before the [[Windows Shell]] loads.\n* [[Automatic Updates]]: The Automatic Updates utility automatically downloads and installs critical updates from the [[Windows Update]] Web site with little user interaction. It is set up to check Windows Update once every 24 hours by default. Users can choose to download which update they want, although high-priority updates must be downloaded and installed.\n* Compressed Folders: Windows Me includes support for [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] files through a shell extension known as Compressed Folders. Originally introduced in the [[Microsoft Plus!|Plus! 98]] pack for Windows 98, this feature allows users to create, access and extract files from ZIP archives similar to a regular folder in Windows. The user can also restrict access to files with a password.\n* A new ''Help and Support'' program has also been added, replacing the [[HTML Help]]-based documentation in Windows 2000 and Windows 98. The Help and Support Center is entirely HTML-based and takes advantage of a technology called Support Automation Framework (SAF), that can show support information from the internet, allows collecting data for troubleshooting via WMI and scripting and for third parties to plug into Windows Help and Support.<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/winme/bulk/oem/health/Support_Automation_Framework_56k/MS_Studio_PCHFest_Support_Automation_Framework.ppt Support Automation Framework]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Several other support tools also shipped with Windows Me.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=/servicedesks/webcasts/en/wc020101/wct020101.asp&sd=dell |title=Windows Millennium Edition support tools webcast |publisher=Support.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref>\n* Windows Me also includes Internet Explorer 5.5, which supports a new Print Preview feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://winsupersite.com/windows/windows-millennium-edition-windows-me-beta-3-reviewed|title=Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me) Beta 3 Reviewed|publisher=SuperSite for Windows|date=12 April 2000|accessdate=2014-11-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129115848/http://winsupersite.com/windows/windows-millennium-edition-windows-me-beta-3-reviewed|archive-date=2014-11-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> It also shipped with the [[MSN Messenger]] Service.\n\n=== Accessibility features ===\n* [[Virtual keyboard|On-Screen Keyboard]]: Originally introduced with Windows 2000, a program called On-Screen Keyboard has been added, which makes it possible to input characters using the mouse instead of the keyboard. This feature is useful for computers that use a [[Graphics tablet|tablet]] as the primary pointing device or for [[accessibility]] purposes.\n* The ''Mouse'' Control Panel incorporates [[IntelliPoint]] features, namely ClickLock (selecting or dragging without continuously holding down the mouse button), hiding the pointer while typing and showing it by pressing ''Ctrl''.\n* The cursor (system caret) can be set to a thicker width.\n* Increased [[Active Accessibility]] support in utilities such as [[Calculator (Windows)|Calculator]] and [[Magnifier (Windows)|Magnifier]].\n\n== Removed features ==\n\n=== Real mode DOS ===\nWindows Me restricted support for [[real mode]] [[MS-DOS]]. As a result, <code>[[IO.SYS]]</code> in Windows Me disregards <code>[[CONFIG.SYS]]</code>, <code>[[COMMAND.COM]]</code> and <code>[[WIN.COM]]</code> and directly executes <code>[[VMM32.VXD]]</code>. In its default configuration the system would neither boot into an MS-DOS command prompt nor exit to DOS from Windows; real mode drivers such as <code>[[ANSI.SYS]]</code> could not be loaded and older applications that require real mode could not be run. Microsoft argued that the change improved the speed and reliability of the boot process.<ref name=\"realmode\" /><ref name=\"FastBoot1\" />\n\nIn Windows Me, the <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> files are used only to set global [[environment variable]]s. The two files (if present) are scanned for settings relating to the environment variables, and any other commands present are removed into a Windows registry key (see below). The two files thus contain only settings and preferences which configure the \"global environment\" for the computer during the boot phase or when starting a new [[virtual DOS machine]] (VDM).\n\nTo specify or edit other startup values (which, in Windows 98, would be present in the <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file) the user must edit the following Windows registry key:\n:<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SessionManager\\Environment</code>\n\nFor troubleshooting and crash recovery, both the Windows Me CD-ROM and the Windows Me startup disk (a user-createable floppy disk, known as the Emergency Boot Disk (EBD)) allowed booting into real mode MS-DOS.\n\nIt is possible to restore real mode DOS functionality through various unofficial means.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/10/21/windows_bugs_me_but/|title=Windows bugs Me \u2013 but a little less?|last=Escalante|first=Luis|date=2000-10-21|work=[[The Register]]|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.multiboot.ru/msdos8.htm |title=Some features of MS-DOS 8.0 |publisher=Multiboot.ru |date= |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref> Additionally, a registry setting exists that re-enables the \"Restart in MS-DOS mode\" option in the [[shutdown (computing)|shutdown]] [[dialog box]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065618/http://www.aaanalyzer.addr.com/msdospolicies.html |title=Activity and Authentication Analyzer |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Other components ===\nUnlike past versions of Windows 9x, Windows Me was entirely aimed at home users, and thus had certain [[Enterprise software|enterprise]]-oriented features removed.

Due to its many bugs and glitches, Windows Me is considered one of the worst operating systems of all time. A ''PC World'' article dubbed Windows Me the \"Mistake Edition\" and placed it 4th in their \"Worst Tech Products of All Time\" feature in 2006.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/125772/worst_products_ever.html?page=2|title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time|last=Tynan|first=Dan|date=May 26, 2006|website=[[PC World]]|access-date=July 23, 2019}}</ref> The article states: \"Shortly after Me appeared in late 2000, users reported problems installing it, getting it to run, getting it to work with other hardware or software, and getting it to stop running.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Consequently, most home users remained with [[Windows 98 Second Edition]], while some moved to [[Windows 2000]] despite the latter being enterprise-oriented.\n\nSystem Restore suffered from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System Restore to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after September 8, 2001 incorrectly. This could prevent System Restore from locating these snapshots and cause the system restore process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem.<ref name=\"Support.microsoft.com\">{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=290700|title=Checkpoints that you create after 8 September 2001 do not restore your computer|date=2007-10-26|website=Microsoft Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227181112/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=290700|archive-date=2013-02-27|url-status=dead|accessdate=2019-04-05}}</ref>\n\nByron Hinson and Julien Jay, writing for ActiveWin, took an appreciative look on the operating system.

{"title_page": "Edward Newenham", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n'''Sir Edward Newenham''' (1734\u20131814) was an Irish politician.\n\n==Life==\nA younger son of William Newenham, of Coolmore, [[County Cork]], and Dorothea, daughter and heiress of [[Edward Worth]], he was born on 5 November 1734. He was appointed collector of the excise of Dublin in 1764, but was removed in 1772, apparently for political reasons.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Newenham, Edward|volume=40}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] Newenham represented [[Enniscorthy (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Enniscorthy]] from 1769 to 1776, and the [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|county of Dublin]] from 1776 to 1797. He was a man of moderate political views, but a reformer of Parliament, within the limits of the constitution, and on strictly Protestant lines. He induced Parliament to add a clause to the Catholic Relief Bill of 1778 for the removal of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] disabilities; but it was opposed by government, and struck out by the English privy council.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAlso he was personal and ardent writing friend to George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. He met Franklin, John Jay and the Marquis de Lafayette whilst on a European Tour with his immediate family during the year of 1782.\n[[File:Francis Wheatley - The Dublin Volunteers on College Green.jpg|upright=1.33|thumb|Painting by [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]] depicting the Dublin Volunteers on [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]].<br><br>Newenham is the figure to the immediate left of the Duke of Leinster, who is positioned centrally, in front of the statue of King William.]]\nA noted \"Duelist\" 3 times over, one of these duels, was over a dispute in parliament. This duel took place on 20 March 1778 between Newenham and [[John Beresford (statesman)|John Beresford]], in which, neither was wounded. On the revival of the Catholic emancipation question in 1782 he spoke against further concessions. He disapproved of [[Henry Flood]]'s renunciation agitation, on the ground that he did not make his amendments at the proper time, and in parliament supported Flood's Reform Bill.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> \nHe took part in the volunteer convention on College Green in 1779, in charge of his \"Liberty Volunteers\". This coincided with a painting by Francis Wheatley (right), depicting this epic event. Sir Edward is noted in this painting, along with the \"Dublin Volunteers\" (Duke of Leinster) and the \"Liberty Artillery\" headed by one of Sir Edward's allies, the Pre-United Irishman - [[James Napper Tandy]].\n\nSir Edward's lifestyle and forethought of his wealth, blindsided him. He did not have budgeting skills on the homefront, leaving massive debts in his wake. In order to pay for one debt, he had to borrow money, thus leaving him continually in debt. Part of this was from his children's marriage settlements, but also the misjudged his Aunt's estate that he was to inherit. One of his prized possessions, [[Belcamp House|Belcamp Hall]] (Henry Grattan's Birthplace), had to be sold to pay for debts. His finances spiralled out of control, when Sir Edward sought exile in England.\nEventually Sir Edward was held up by 4 baliff's that carried him back to Ireland, to face a \u00a3500 debt, where he had to front up that he couldn't pay it.\nHe was therefore placed in to \"debtors prison\" under the very jail he sought to be built many years before - that was \"Kilmainham Jail\".\nSir Edward's son, Edward Worth would not come to the aid of his father, rather Sir Edward had to seek \"clemency\" from Lord Castlereagh to secure a release. He eventually was released.<ref name=\"page274 \"/>\n\nDuring 1785 Newenham suffered from ill-health.

He was a man of moderate political views, but a reformer of Parliament, within the limits of the constitution, and on strictly Protestant lines. He induced Parliament to add a clause to the Catholic Relief Bill of 1778 for the removal of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] disabilities; but it was opposed by government, and struck out by the English privy council.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAlso he was personal and ardent writing friend to George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. He met Franklin, John Jay and the Marquis de Lafayette whilst on a European Tour with his immediate family during the year of 1782.\n[[File:Francis Wheatley - The Dublin Volunteers on College Green.jpg|upright=1.33|thumb|Painting by [[Francis Wheatley (painter)|Francis Wheatley]] depicting the Dublin Volunteers on [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]].<br><br>Newenham is the figure to the immediate left of the Duke of Leinster, who is positioned centrally, in front of the statue of King William.]]\nA noted \"Duelist\" 3 times over, one of these duels, was over a dispute in parliament. This duel took place on 20 March 1778 between Newenham and [[John Beresford (statesman)|John Beresford]], in which, neither was wounded. On the revival of the Catholic emancipation question in 1782 he spoke against further concessions. He disapproved of [[Henry Flood]]'s renunciation agitation, on the ground that he did not make his amendments at the proper time, and in parliament supported Flood's Reform Bill.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> \nHe took part in the volunteer convention on College Green in 1779, in charge of his \"Liberty Volunteers\". This coincided with a painting by Francis Wheatley (right), depicting this epic event. Sir Edward is noted in this painting, along with the \"Dublin Volunteers\" (Duke of Leinster) and the \"Liberty Artillery\" headed by one of Sir Edward's allies, the Pre-United Irishman - [[James Napper Tandy]].\n\nSir Edward's lifestyle and forethought of his wealth, blindsided him. He did not have budgeting skills on the homefront, leaving massive debts in his wake. In order to pay for one debt, he had to borrow money, thus leaving him continually in debt. Part of this was from his children's marriage settlements, but also the misjudged his Aunt's estate that he was to inherit. One of his prized possessions, [[Belcamp House|Belcamp Hall]] (Henry Grattan's Birthplace), had to be sold to pay for debts. His finances spiralled out of control, when Sir Edward sought exile in England.\nEventually Sir Edward was held up by 4 baliff's that carried him back to Ireland, to face a \u00a3500 debt, where he had to front up that he couldn't pay it.\nHe was therefore placed in to \"debtors prison\" under the very jail he sought to be built many years before - that was \"Kilmainham Jail\".\nSir Edward's son, Edward Worth would not come to the aid of his father, rather Sir Edward had to seek \"clemency\" from Lord Castlereagh to secure a release.

This outflow prevents massive flooding of the lower reaches of the river; it also promotes fish migration from the river to the lakes for spawning, but drives  birds away from the lakes.<ref name=m160/>\n\nThe river discharges into the [[South China Sea]] creating a marshy delta, which spreads both inland and into the sea, with the [[silt]] deposits extending up to {{convert|50-60|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Borneo coast.<ref name=m131/> The delta is located west-southwest of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], the capital of [[West Kalimantan]] province, which lies at the [[equator]].<ref name=w1/> The delta has five arms, of which the northernmost one is the widest, and is therefore called the Big Kapuas ({{lang-id|Kapuas Besar}}).

The number of individuals per species is relatively low. The large variety of species may be explained by the fact that some 6,000 years ago, the Kapuas River, as a tributary of the [[Sundaland|Sunda River]], was connected to other tributary rivers of [[South Sumatra]], [[Java]] and [[Malay Peninsula]]. Apart from fish, there are numerous crabs, prawns, [[water strider]]s and other aquatic insects.<ref name=m132>MacKinnon, p. 132</ref> The rich flora and fauna results in very complex [[food chain]]s, with fishes consuming foods ranging from fruits to other fish. For example, ''[[Hemirhamphodon]] pogonognathus'' feeds exclusively on terrestrial insects. Abundant fruits and seeds enter the river after falling from large trees which bend over its waters.<ref name=m161>MacKinnon, p. 161</ref> The feeding habits of the fish in the Kapuas River are distributed as follows: 54% are [[omnivore]]s; 36% are carnivorous and eat other fish (14%), insects (5%) and mixed small forest animals (17%). The remaining 10% are herbivorous, with 4% of them specialising in [[algae]].<ref name=m162/>\n\n== Transport and economic value ==\nThe Kapuas River is the major waterway connecting the center of the island with its western coast. The large river width and depth (up to 27 meters<ref name=\"SM\" />) support intensive cargo and passenger shipping over most of the river length.

These lakes are Bekuan (area 1,268 hectares), Belida (600 ha), Genali (2,000 ha), Keleka Tangai (756 ha), Luar (5,208 ha), Pengembung (1,548 ha), Sambor (673 ha), Sekawi (672 ha), Sentarum (2,324 ha), Sependan (604 ha), Seriang (1,412) Sumbai (800 ha), Sumpa (664) and Tekenang (1,564 ha).<ref name=m152>MacKinnon, pp. 152, 159</ref> When the monthly precipitation exceeds about {{convert|300|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the river overflows its banks, diverting much of its waters to the lakes at a rate of up to {{convert|1000|m3/s|ft3/s|abbr=on}}, and forming a single volume of water with them. This outflow prevents massive flooding of the lower reaches of the river; it also promotes fish migration from the river to the lakes for spawning, but drives  birds away from the lakes.<ref name=m160/>\n\nThe river discharges into the [[South China Sea]] creating a marshy delta, which spreads both inland and into the sea, with the [[silt]] deposits extending up to {{convert|50-60|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Borneo coast.<ref name=m131/> The delta is located west-southwest of [[Pontianak, Indonesia|Pontianak]], the capital of [[West Kalimantan]] province, which lies at the [[equator]].<ref name=w1/> The delta has five arms, of which the northernmost one is the widest, and is therefore called the Big Kapuas ({{lang-id|Kapuas Besar}}). The largest tributary is the [[Melawi River]], which occurs to the left near the city of [[Sintang]], about 465&nbsp;km from the mouth.

The number of individuals per species is relatively low. The large variety of species may be explained by the fact that some 6,000 years ago, the Kapuas River, as a tributary of the [[Sundaland|Sunda River]], was connected to other tributary rivers of [[South Sumatra]], [[Java]] and [[Malay Peninsula]]. Apart from fish, there are numerous crabs, prawns, [[water strider]]s and other aquatic insects.<ref name=m132>MacKinnon, p. 132</ref> The rich flora and fauna results in very complex [[food chain]]s, with fishes consuming foods ranging from fruits to other fish. For example, ''[[Hemirhamphodon]] pogonognathus'' feeds exclusively on terrestrial insects. Abundant fruits and seeds enter the river after falling from large trees which bend over its waters.<ref name=m161>MacKinnon, p. 161</ref> The feeding habits of the fish in the Kapuas River are distributed as follows: 54% are [[omnivore]]s; 36% are carnivorous and eat other fish (14%), insects (5%) and mixed small forest animals (17%). The remaining 10% are herbivorous, with 4% of them specialising in [[algae]].<ref name=m162/>\n\n== Transport and economic value ==\nThe Kapuas River is the major waterway connecting the center of the island with its western coast.

Their number dwindled from 251,350 in 1970 to 53,145 in 2010. As most [[Russian Jews]], Moscow Jews also migrated to [[Israel]] and the US.\n\nJews began to settle in Moscow around the 16th century. In the 19th as the [[Pale of Settlement]]  was instructed Jews were forbidden to settle in the city except for those who served in the army and after their end of service allowed to stay in the city. In 1848 there were 313 Jews in Moscow. In 1861, during the reign of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]],  \"[[useful Jew]]s\", such as scholars, merchants and artisans, were allowed to settle in Moscow and the number of Jews grew rapidly. In 1890 they numbered 40,000 men and the community built synagogues, schools and charities, many located in the Zarayadye quarter on the Moskva River and in Marina Rostcha neighborhood.<ref name=\"kehilalinks.jewishgen.org\">[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Moskva/MoskvaHistory.htm A Brief History of the Moscow Community]. Kehilalinks.jewishgen.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, a more radical policy was adopted towards the Jews. Jewish enrolment was restricted in schools and universities and in 1891 all Jews were forced out of Moscow.\n\nAfter the [[Russian revolution]] in 1917 the pale of settlement was abolished and Jews were permitted to settle again in the city, many of whom were refugees. In the 1920s and 30s, the state promoted Yiddish-language arts and literature in an effort to influence its Jewish citizens. This resulted in a brief, rich cultural flourishing exemplified by the famed Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, whose inaugural production (1921) was a staging of Sholem Aleichem's stories with sets by Marc Chagall. In 1939 there were around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.<ref name=\"kehilalinks.jewishgen.org\"/>\n\nDuring WWII many Jews fled to inner parts of the Soviet Union but most of them returned at the end of the war and by 1970 there were again around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of Jews emigrated from the city.

Their number dwindled from 251,350 in 1970 to 53,145 in 2010. As most [[Russian Jews]], Moscow Jews also migrated to [[Israel]] and the US.\n\nJews began to settle in Moscow around the 16th century. In the 19th as the [[Pale of Settlement]]  was instructed Jews were forbidden to settle in the city except for those who served in the army and after their end of service allowed to stay in the city. In 1848 there were 313 Jews in Moscow. In 1861, during the reign of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]],  \"[[useful Jew]]s\", such as scholars, merchants and artisans, were allowed to settle in Moscow and the number of Jews grew rapidly. In 1890 they numbered 40,000 men and the community built synagogues, schools and charities, many located in the Zarayadye quarter on the Moskva River and in Marina Rostcha neighborhood.<ref name=\"kehilalinks.jewishgen.org\">[http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/Moskva/MoskvaHistory.htm A Brief History of the Moscow Community]. Kehilalinks.jewishgen.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>\n\nNevertheless, after the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, a more radical policy was adopted towards the Jews. Jewish enrolment was restricted in schools and universities and in 1891 all Jews were forced out of Moscow.\n\nAfter the [[Russian revolution]] in 1917 the pale of settlement was abolished and Jews were permitted to settle again in the city, many of whom were refugees. In the 1920s and 30s, the state promoted Yiddish-language arts and literature in an effort to influence its Jewish citizens. This resulted in a brief, rich cultural flourishing exemplified by the famed Moscow State Yiddish Theatre, whose inaugural production (1921) was a staging of Sholem Aleichem's stories with sets by Marc Chagall. In 1939 there were around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.<ref name=\"kehilalinks.jewishgen.org\"/>\n\nDuring WWII many Jews fled to inner parts of the Soviet Union but most of them returned at the end of the war and by 1970 there were again around 250,000 Jews in Moscow.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, most of Jews emigrated from the city. In that period there was a revival of Jewish religious life, the leading bodies of Russia\u2019s Jewish organizations were centered in Moscow and a number of synagogues re-opened.
