When Angkor fell, its artisans, Brahmins, and dancers were taken captive to Ayutthaya.<ref name=\"Fletcher2001\"/>\n\n'''French colonial era'''\n\nDancers of the court of [[Sisowath of Cambodia|King Sisowath]] were exhibited at the 1906 Colonial Exposition in [[Marseilles]] at the suggestion of George Bois, a French representative in the Cambodian court.<ref name=\"Jacobsen2008\">[[#Jacobsen2008|Jacobsen]], p. 156</ref> Auguste Rodin was captivated by the Cambodian dancers and painted a series of water colors of the dancers.

See http://www.jiras.se/preahsamuth/index.html, which shows the dance drama Preah Samut and characters wielding bows and staves.</ref> In some dances, dancers hold items such as flower garlands, fans, and gold and silver flowers as a tribute (''see {{transl|ms|[[bunga mas]]}}'').<ref group=\"unver.\">See [File:Cambodian_Classical_Dance_of_Tribute.ogv] as an example where dancers hold gold flowers as a tribute.</ref> Performances of ''{{transl|km|robam makar}}'' (the [[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] dance) entail devas dancing in leisure and using fans to represent the scales of the mythical makara while the goddess [[Manimekhala]] leads the mimicry with her crystal ball of magic.<ref group=\"unver.\">As seen in the Khmer classical dance video posted on this webpage: <http://danceinteractive.jacobspillow.org/dance/dance-spirit-cambodia> and many others.</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Cambodian_dance_Reamker.png|935px|A scene from the Reamker; a battle between Rama and Ravana performed in the courtyard of the Silver Pagoda, c. 1900s~1920s}}\n\n== Movement and gestures ==\n\nKhmer classical dancers use stylized movements and [[gesture]]s to convey meaning and tell a story. These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers.\n\nHand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called ''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' (meaning \"style\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts.<ref name=\"Fletcher2001\"/> The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n[[File:BupphaDeviDance.png|thumb|Princess [[Buppha Devi]] performs a propitiation dance (c. 1965) as a ''{{transl|km|neang rong}}''. Note the dancers of lower ranks (''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') in [[obeisance]].]]\n\nFour main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male), ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female), ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogres or [[asuras]]), and the ''{{transl|km|sva}}'' (monkeys).<ref name=\"Bois\">[[#Bois|Bois]], p. 4</ref> These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ''{{transl|km|neay rong ek}}'', for example, would be a leading male role and a ''{{transl|km|neang kamnan}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') would be a maiden-servant.<ref name=\"Bois\"/> The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ''{{transl|km|yeakheney}}'', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ''{{transl|km|ngoh}}'' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}''.\n\nMost roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n'''''{{transl|km|Neay rong}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay rong ek}}'' - deities, kings, or princes (e.g. [[Rama]])\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - ''aide-de-camp'' of important characters\n*''{{transl|km|Sena ek}}'' - the generals\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Neang}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neang ek}}'' - deities, queens or princesses (e.g. [[Sita]] and [[Manimekhala]])\n*''{{transl|km|Neang rong}}'' - [[noblewomen]] or angels (e.g., the daughters of the tycoon, Sampov Keo and Sampov Meas in the dance drama: ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'')\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - female ''aid-de-camp'' (ex. {{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}})\n*''{{transl|km|Neang kamnan}}'' or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'' - female servants or attendants\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Yeak}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak ek}}'' - premiere ogres or asuras (e.g., [[Ravana]])\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak rong}}'' - the lesser ogres\n*''{{transl|km|Yeakheney}}'' - ogresses, [[yakkhini]] (e.g. [[Surpanakha]])\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Sva}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay sva khen}}'' - monkey generals (e.g., [[Hanuman]])\n*''{{transl|km|Pouk khen sva}}'' - monkey soldiers\n\n'''Other character types'''\n*Apsaras - celestial nymphs\n*''{{transl|km|Kinnorey}}'' - the mythical [[kinnara|kinnaris]] (e.g. [[Manohara]])\n*''{{transl|km|Maccha}}'' - [[mermaid]]s (e.g., [[Suvannamaccha]])\n*''{{transl|km|Ngoh}}'' - a special masculine role depicting a [[negrito]]\n*''Eysey'' - hermits or [[rishi]], a non-dancing role\n*[[Porter (carrier)|Porters]] - involved loosely in the dance, generally does not dance\n\n'''Animals'''\n*[[Garuda]] and mythical birds (e.g. [[Jatayu]])\n*[[Deer]] - the Golden Deer in the ''Ramayana''\n*[[Peafowl]]\n*[[Lion]]s\n*[[Horse]]\n}}\n\n== Costume ==\n[[File:Apsara dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apsara]] dancer]]\nClassical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit.\n\n=== Female costume ===\n\nThe typical female, or ''{{transl|km|neang}}'', costume consists of a ''{{transl|km|[[sampot]] sarabap}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|charabap}}''), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then [[pleated]] into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a [[shawl]]-like garment called a ''{{transl|km|[[sbai]]}}'' (also known as the ''{{transl|km|robang khnang}}'', literally \"back cover\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the ''sbai'' these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the ''sbai'' is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}''.\n\nJewelry for the female role includes a large, [[filigreed|filigree]] square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists [[bracelets]] and [[bangle]]s, an [[arm ring|armlet]] on the right arm, and body chains of various styles.\n\n=== Male costume ===\n\nMale characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ''{{transl|km|sampot sarabap}}'' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or ''neay rong'', the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is worn in the ''{{transl|km|[[chang kben]]}}'' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered [[hem]] around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}'', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of [[epaulette]] that arches upwards like [[Indra]]'s bow (known as ''{{transl|km|inthanu}}''). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ''{{transl|km|robang muk}}'' while the two side pieces are known as a ''{{transl|km|cheay kraeng}}''; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a ''{{transl|km|robang kraoy}}''.\n\nMale characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''; it may be made of gold-colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ''{{transl|km|sloek po}}'' (named after the [[bo tree]] leaf), which serves as a center point for their ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''.\n\n=== Headdress ===\n\nThere are several types of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the ''{{transl|km|kbang}}''; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. [[Divinity|Divinities]] and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksat}}'' for male characters and a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksatrey}}'' for female characters. The ''{{transl|km|panchuret}}'' (Groslier romanizes this as ''{{transl|km|panntiereth}}''), reserved for princes and generals (''{{transl|km|sena}}''), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ''{{transl|km|rat klao}}'' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ''{{transl|km|mokot}}'' attached.\n\n=== Floral adornments ===\n\nDancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of ''[[Jasminum sambac]]'' strung together with ''[[Michelia]]'' flowers, being either ''[[Michelia \u00d7 alba]]'' or ''[[Michelia champaca]]''. The ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The ''apsara'' role is most often adorned with the flowers of either ''[[Plumeria obtusa]]'' or white cultivars of ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Pinpeat}}\n{{listen \n | filename     = Khmer classical dance song.ogg\n | title        = Krai Thong\n | description  = A song from a scene in the dance drama Krai Thong.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThe music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of [[xylophones]], [[drum]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[gong]]s, and other [[musical instrument]]s. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [\u0259\u02d0], eung [\u0259\u02d0\u014b], and euy [\u0259\u02d0j] in various patterns.\n\n=== Musical instruments ===\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat ek]]}}'' : The lead xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat thung]]}}'' : A xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys; low\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat dek]]}}'' : A metallophone of brass keys\n*''{{transl|km|Roneat thong}}'' : A metallophone (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong thom]]}}'' : A set of 16 gongs arranged in a circle\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong toch]]}}'' : Like the gongs above, but smaller\n*''{{transl|km|[[Chhing]]}}'' : A pair of finger cymbals\n*''{{transl|km|Krap}}'' : A pair of wood clappers (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sralai]]}}'' : A type of shawm; there are two sizes\n*''{{transl|km|[[Khloy]]}}'' : A type of flute made from bamboo (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|Skor thom}}'' : A pair of drums played with a percussion mallet\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sampho]]}}'' : A type of drum played with the hands\n}}\n\n=== Music pieces ===\nKhmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking. These musical pieces are arranged to form a suite. New pieces of music are rarely created.\n\nBelow is a select list of music pieces used in the repertoire:\n\n*''{{transl|km|Sathukar}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17b6\u1792\u17bb\u1780\u17b6\u179a}}) a song of blessing used for [[propitiation]], often used to commence a performance\n*''{{transl|km|Krao nai}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c5\u178e\u17c3}}), also known as ''{{transl|km|santheuk knong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u1793\u17d2\u1792\u17b9\u1780\u1780\u17d2\u1793\u17bb\u1784}}), overture of the ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogre) characters, a display of power as they go into [[combat]] or battle\n*''{{transl|km|Smaeu}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17d2\u1798\u17be}}) used for the introduction of a character or a group of dancers in a scene\n*''{{transl|km|Lea}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17b6}}) used to present a character's departure from the scene; leaving the [[stage (theatre)|stage]]\n*''{{transl|km|Cheut chhing}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u1787\u17be\u178f\u1788\u17b7\u1784}}) lit., [[euphonic]] ''{{transl|km|[[chhing]]}}''; music characterized by the constant percussion of drums and small cup-shaped cymbals;<ref group=\"unver.\">Robert K.

Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably ''robam monosanhchettana'' by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as ''Apsara Mera''. [[Sophiline Cheam Shapiro]] has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ''{{transl|km|Samritechak}}'', an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' and ''{{transl|km|Pamina Devi}}'', an adaptation of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n=== Dance dramas ===\n\nThe repertoire of dance dramas ({{lang|km|\u179a\u17bf\u1784}}, ''{{transl|km|roeung}}'') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', which is limited only to the ''Ramayana''. Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the ''lakhon nai'' dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as ''[[Preah Thong and Neang Neak|Roeung Preah Thong-Neang Neak]]''; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003.\n\nThe plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a [[damsel in distress]] or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as [[karma]].\n\n[[File:Cambodian Classical Dance of Tribute.ogv|thumb|400px|A dance of tribute used in a dance drama titled ''Preah Ket Mealea'', circa 1965]]\n\n==== Select repertory of dance dramas ====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''{{transl|km|[[Reamker]]}}'' (''Ramakerti'', {{lang|km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u17b7\u17cd}}): Ramayana\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sothon-Neang Monorea}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17bc\u1792\u1793-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u17a0\u17cd\u179a\u17b6}}): Sudhana-Jataka, formerly referred to as ''{{transl|km|Kailas}} ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17c3\u179b\u17b6\u179f}}), recreated in 2003\n* ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1790\u17c4\u1784}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Inao}}'' ({{lang|km|\u17a5\u178e\u17b6\u179c}}): [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Kakey}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17b8}}): Kakati-Jataka\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Anoruth-Neang Usa}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u17a2\u1793\u17bb\u179a\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u17a7\u179f\u17b6}}): [[Aniruddha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u1797\u179b\u1780\u17d2\u1781\u178e\u17cd}}): [[Chitralekha (deity)|Chitralekha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Samot}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u1798\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Sovannahong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u17a0\u1784\u17d2\u179f}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sang}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d0\u1784\u17d2\u1781}})\n}}\n\n=== Dances ===\n\nIn contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as ''{{transl|km|robam}}''. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many ''robam'' are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ''{{transl|km|robam mekhala-reamso}}'' and ''{{transl|km|robam sovan macchha}}'' (the latter being from the ''{{transl|km|Reamker}}'').\n\nThe 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the [[bas-relief]] of ''apsaras'' on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the [[Angkor]] period.\n\n==== Select repertory of dances ====\n\n* [[Apsara Dance|Robam Apsara]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u17a2\u1794\u17d2\u179f\u179a\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Tep Monorom]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1791\u17c1\u1796\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799)\n* [[Robam Chun Por]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1787\u17bc\u1793\u1796\u179a)\n* [[Robam Makar]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u1780\u179a)\n* [[Robam Sovann Maccha]] (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u1798\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17b6)\n* [[Robam Moni Mekhala]] or Mekhala-Reamesor (\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u178e\u17b8\u1798\u17c1\u1781\u179b\u17b6)\n\n== Glossary ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n;''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785}}) : (lit., \"style\" or \"motif\") referring to a pose or gesture used in Khmer classical dance\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793}}) : (lit., \"theatre\"; also romanized as ''lakhaon'' and ''lkhaon''), referring to different genres of theatrical performances\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799}}): (lit., \"theatre of royal wealth\") the Khmer name for the main classical dance drama of Cambodia; the royal ballet of Cambodia, in this case, the term ''lakhon'' may be substituted with ''robam''\n;''{{transl|km|robam}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6}}) : (lit., \"dance\"), a term used to refer to dances and in some contexts, all classical dances\n;''{{transl|km|robam kbach boran}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1794\u17bc\u179a\u17b6\u178e}}): (lit., \"dance of the ancient style\") a term referring to classical dance that is used in the genres of theatre including ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', ''{{transl|km|lakhon pol srey}}'', and ''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}''.

These gestures are often vague and abstract, though some may be easily understood. Dancers do not sing or generally speak, except in some dance dramas where there are brief instances of speech by the dancers.\n\nHand gestures in Khmer classical dance are called ''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' (meaning \"style\"). These hand gestures form a sort of alphabet and represent various things from nature such as fruit, flowers and leaves. They are used in different combinations and transitions with accompanying movement of the legs and feet to convey different thoughts and concepts.<ref name=\"Fletcher2001\"/> The way gestures are presented, the position of the arm, and the position of the hand relative to the arm can affect their meaning. Gestures are performed in different manners depending on the character type.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n[[File:BupphaDeviDance.png|thumb|Princess [[Buppha Devi]] performs a propitiation dance (c. 1965) as a ''{{transl|km|neang rong}}''. Note the dancers of lower ranks (''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') in [[obeisance]].]]\n\nFour main types of roles exist in Khmer classical dance: ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male), ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female), ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogres or [[asuras]]), and the ''{{transl|km|sva}}'' (monkeys).<ref name=\"Bois\">[[#Bois|Bois]], p. 4</ref> These four basic roles contain sub-classes to indicate character rank; a ''{{transl|km|neay rong ek}}'', for example, would be a leading male role and a ''{{transl|km|neang kamnan}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'') would be a maiden-servant.<ref name=\"Bois\"/> The sub-classes of the four main roles all perform in the same type of dancing style of the class they belong to. However, the ''{{transl|km|yeakheney}}'', or female ogre, is performed with a feminized dancing style of the male counterpart. Other female character types, such as the apsara, kinnari, or mermaid, follow the same dancing style as the ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' role but with subtle differences in gestures; the main difference being costume. The ''{{transl|km|ngoh}}'' character type, although male, is presented with a different dancing style than the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}''.\n\nMost roles are performed by female dancers, but the role of monkeys was transferred to men under the guidance of Queen Sisowath Kosssamak. Other roles performed by men include hermits and animals such as horses and mythical lions.\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n'''''{{transl|km|Neay rong}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay rong ek}}'' - deities, kings, or princes (e.g. [[Rama]])\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - ''aide-de-camp'' of important characters\n*''{{transl|km|Sena ek}}'' - the generals\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Neang}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neang ek}}'' - deities, queens or princesses (e.g. [[Sita]] and [[Manimekhala]])\n*''{{transl|km|Neang rong}}'' - [[noblewomen]] or angels (e.g., the daughters of the tycoon, Sampov Keo and Sampov Meas in the dance drama: ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'')\n*''{{transl|km|Philieng ek}}'' - female ''aid-de-camp'' (ex. {{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}})\n*''{{transl|km|Neang kamnan}}'' or ''{{transl|km|philieng}}'' - female servants or attendants\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Yeak}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak ek}}'' - premiere ogres or asuras (e.g., [[Ravana]])\n*''{{transl|km|Yeak rong}}'' - the lesser ogres\n*''{{transl|km|Yeakheney}}'' - ogresses, [[yakkhini]] (e.g. [[Surpanakha]])\n\n'''''{{transl|km|Sva}}'''''\n*''{{transl|km|Neay sva khen}}'' - monkey generals (e.g., [[Hanuman]])\n*''{{transl|km|Pouk khen sva}}'' - monkey soldiers\n\n'''Other character types'''\n*Apsaras - celestial nymphs\n*''{{transl|km|Kinnorey}}'' - the mythical [[kinnara|kinnaris]] (e.g. [[Manohara]])\n*''{{transl|km|Maccha}}'' - [[mermaid]]s (e.g., [[Suvannamaccha]])\n*''{{transl|km|Ngoh}}'' - a special masculine role depicting a [[negrito]]\n*''Eysey'' - hermits or [[rishi]], a non-dancing role\n*[[Porter (carrier)|Porters]] - involved loosely in the dance, generally does not dance\n\n'''Animals'''\n*[[Garuda]] and mythical birds (e.g. [[Jatayu]])\n*[[Deer]] - the Golden Deer in the ''Ramayana''\n*[[Peafowl]]\n*[[Lion]]s\n*[[Horse]]\n}}\n\n== Costume ==\n[[File:Apsara dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apsara]] dancer]]\nClassical dance costumes are highly ornate and heavily embroidered, sometimes including sequins and even semi-precious gems. Most of the costumes are thought to be representative of what divinities wear, as reflected in the art style of the post-Angkor period. Various pieces of the costume (such as shirts) have to be sewn onto the dancers for a tight fit.\n\n=== Female costume ===\n\nThe typical female, or ''{{transl|km|neang}}'', costume consists of a ''{{transl|km|[[sampot]] sarabap}}'' (or ''{{transl|km|charabap}}''), a type of woven fabric with two contrasting silk threads along with a metallic thread (gold or silver in color). The ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is wrapped around the lower body in a sarong-like fashion, then [[pleated]] into a band in the front and secured with a gold or brass belt. In the current style, part of the pleated brocade band hangs over the belt on the left side of the belt buckle, which is a clear distinction from Thai classical dance costumes where this pleated band is tucked into the belt to the right of the belt buckle. Worn over the left shoulder is a [[shawl]]-like garment called a ''{{transl|km|[[sbai]]}}'' (also known as the ''{{transl|km|robang khnang}}'', literally \"back cover\"); it is the most decorative part of the female costume, embroidered extensively with tiny beads and sequins. The usual embroidery pattern for the ''sbai'' these days is a diamond-shaped floral pattern, but in the past there were more variations of floral patterns. Under the ''sbai'' is a silk undershirt or bodice worn with a short sleeve exposed on the left arm. Around the neck is an embroidered collar called a ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}''.\n\nJewelry for the female role includes a large, [[filigreed|filigree]] square pendant of which is hung by the corner, various types of ankle and wrists [[bracelets]] and [[bangle]]s, an [[arm ring|armlet]] on the right arm, and body chains of various styles.\n\n=== Male costume ===\n\nMale characters wear costumes that are more intricate than the females, as they require pieces, like sleeves, to be sewn together while being put on. They are dressed in a ''{{transl|km|sampot sarabap}}'' like their female counterpart; however, it is worn differently. For the male, or ''neay rong'', the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' is worn in the ''{{transl|km|[[chang kben]]}}'' fashion, where the front is pleated and pulled under, between the legs, then tucked in the back and the remaining length of the pleat is stitched to the ''{{transl|km|sampot}}'' itself to form a draping 'fan' in the back. Knee-length pants are worn underneath, displaying a wide, embroidered [[hem]] around the knees. For the top, they wear long-sleeved shirts with rich embroidering, along with a collar, or ''{{transl|km|srang kar}}'', around their neck. On the end of their shoulders are a sort of [[epaulette]] that arches upwards like [[Indra]]'s bow (known as ''{{transl|km|inthanu}}''). Other components of the male costumes are three richly embroidered banners worn around the front waist. The center piece is known as a ''{{transl|km|robang muk}}'' while the two side pieces are known as a ''{{transl|km|cheay kraeng}}''; monkeys and yaksha characters wear another piece in the back called a ''{{transl|km|robang kraoy}}''.\n\nMale characters also wear an X-like strap around the body called a ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''; it may be made of gold-colored silk or chains of gold with square ornaments, the latter being reserved for more important characters. Males wear the same ankle and wrist jewelry as females, but with the addition of an extra set of bangles on the wrist and no armlets. They also wear a kite-shaped ornament called a ''{{transl|km|sloek po}}'' (named after the [[bo tree]] leaf), which serves as a center point for their ''{{transl|km|sangvar}}''.\n\n=== Headdress ===\n\nThere are several types of [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] that denote characters' ranks. Commonly worn by female characters of the lowest rank is the ''{{transl|km|kbang}}''; it is also worn by Brahmin characters with ornaments around a bun of hair. [[Divinity|Divinities]] and royal characters of the highest ranks wear a tall single-spire crown called a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksat}}'' for male characters and a ''{{transl|km|mokot ksatrey}}'' for female characters. The ''{{transl|km|panchuret}}'' (Groslier romanizes this as ''{{transl|km|panntiereth}}''), reserved for princes and generals (''{{transl|km|sena}}''), is a circlet-like crown with a faux knot in the back. The ''{{transl|km|rat klao}}'' is worn by princesses and often by maidens of significance in a dance if they happen to not be of royal rank. Some characters' headdressings include ear ornaments as well as earrings. Characters such as ogres and monkeys wear masks. Ogres and monkeys of royal rank wear masks with a ''{{transl|km|mokot}}'' attached.\n\n=== Floral adornments ===\n\nDancers are traditionally adorned with fragrant flowers, although sometimes fresh flowers are substituted with faux flowers. The floral tassel is traditionally made of ''[[Jasminum sambac]]'' strung together with ''[[Michelia]]'' flowers, being either ''[[Michelia \u00d7 alba]]'' or ''[[Michelia champaca]]''. The ''{{transl|km|neang}}'' (female) role wears a rose above the right ear and a floral tassel attached to the left side of the crown while the ''{{transl|km|neay rong}}'' (male) role wears a rose on the left ear and a floral tassel to the right side. Sometimes, dancers will wear jasmine garlands fit for the wrists. The ''apsara'' role is most often adorned with the flowers of either ''[[Plumeria obtusa]]'' or white cultivars of ''[[Plumeria rubra]]''; sometimes plumerias are tied along the back of their hair.\n\n== Music ==\n{{main|Pinpeat}}\n{{listen \n | filename     = Khmer classical dance song.ogg\n | title        = Krai Thong\n | description  = A song from a scene in the dance drama Krai Thong.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nThe music used for Khmer classical dance is played by a pinpeat ensemble. This type of orchestra consists of several types of [[xylophones]], [[drum]]s, [[oboe]]s, [[gong]]s, and other [[musical instrument]]s. The chorus consists of several singers who mainly sing in the absence of music. The lyrics are in poetry form and are sung interspersed with the grammatical particles eu [\u0259\u02d0], eung [\u0259\u02d0\u014b], and euy [\u0259\u02d0j] in various patterns.\n\n=== Musical instruments ===\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat ek]]}}'' : The lead xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat thung]]}}'' : A xylophone with bamboo or teak wood keys; low\n*''{{transl|km|[[Roneat dek]]}}'' : A metallophone of brass keys\n*''{{transl|km|Roneat thong}}'' : A metallophone (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong thom]]}}'' : A set of 16 gongs arranged in a circle\n*''{{transl|km|[[Kong toch]]}}'' : Like the gongs above, but smaller\n*''{{transl|km|[[Chhing]]}}'' : A pair of finger cymbals\n*''{{transl|km|Krap}}'' : A pair of wood clappers (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sralai]]}}'' : A type of shawm; there are two sizes\n*''{{transl|km|[[Khloy]]}}'' : A type of flute made from bamboo (now rarely used)\n*''{{transl|km|Skor thom}}'' : A pair of drums played with a percussion mallet\n*''{{transl|km|[[Sampho]]}}'' : A type of drum played with the hands\n}}\n\n=== Music pieces ===\nKhmer classical dance uses particular pieces of music for certain events, such as when a dancer enters or leaves a scene, or performs certain actions, such as flying or walking. These musical pieces are arranged to form a suite. New pieces of music are rarely created.\n\nBelow is a select list of music pieces used in the repertoire:\n\n*''{{transl|km|Sathukar}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17b6\u1792\u17bb\u1780\u17b6\u179a}}) a song of blessing used for [[propitiation]], often used to commence a performance\n*''{{transl|km|Krao nai}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c5\u178e\u17c3}}), also known as ''{{transl|km|santheuk knong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u1793\u17d2\u1792\u17b9\u1780\u1780\u17d2\u1793\u17bb\u1784}}), overture of the ''{{transl|km|yeak}}'' (ogre) characters, a display of power as they go into [[combat]] or battle\n*''{{transl|km|Smaeu}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17d2\u1798\u17be}}) used for the introduction of a character or a group of dancers in a scene\n*''{{transl|km|Lea}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17b6}}) used to present a character's departure from the scene; leaving the [[stage (theatre)|stage]]\n*''{{transl|km|Cheut chhing}}'' : ({{lang|km|\u1787\u17be\u178f\u1788\u17b7\u1784}}) lit., [[euphonic]] ''{{transl|km|[[chhing]]}}''; music characterized by the constant percussion of drums and small cup-shaped cymbals;<ref group=\"unver.\">Robert K.

Since the restoration of the Royal Ballet in the 1979, some of the old repertoire was recreated and several new dances were also created, most notably ''robam monosanhchettana'' by the late Chea Samy. As of recent years, new dance dramas have been created by the Royal Ballet, such as ''Apsara Mera''. [[Sophiline Cheam Shapiro]] has also introduced new repertory to Khmer classical dance, although they are not part of the traditional royal repertoire and mainly have been performed in Western venues. Her works include dramas such as ''{{transl|km|Samritechak}}'', an adaptation of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Othello]]'' and ''{{transl|km|Pamina Devi}}'', an adaptation of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[The Magic Flute]]''.\n\n=== Dance dramas ===\n\nThe repertoire of dance dramas ({{lang|km|\u179a\u17bf\u1784}}, ''{{transl|km|roeung}}'') consists of a myriad of stories, unlike the ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', which is limited only to the ''Ramayana''. Many of the dance dramas have analogs in the ''lakhon nai'' dance genre of Thailand but do not share the same choreography or exact storyline. During the time of Queen Kossamak, several dance dramas were re-choreographed and shortened such as ''[[Preah Thong and Neang Neak|Roeung Preah Thong-Neang Neak]]''; this drama, among others, would be recreated in 2003.\n\nThe plots of many dance dramas often concern a male character who rescues a [[damsel in distress]] or destined love presented with obstacles. The traditional repertoire portrays mythology or traditional tales and may sometimes include religious concepts such as [[karma]].\n\n[[File:Cambodian Classical Dance of Tribute.ogv|thumb|400px|A dance of tribute used in a dance drama titled ''Preah Ket Mealea'', circa 1965]]\n\n==== Select repertory of dance dramas ====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''{{transl|km|[[Reamker]]}}'' (''Ramakerti'', {{lang|km|\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u1780\u17c1\u179a\u17d2\u178f\u17b7\u17cd}}): Ramayana\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sothon-Neang Monorea}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17bc\u1792\u1793-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u17a0\u17cd\u179a\u17b6}}): Sudhana-Jataka, formerly referred to as ''{{transl|km|Kailas}} ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17c3\u179b\u17b6\u179f}}), recreated in 2003\n* ''{{transl|km|Krai Thong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u179a\u17c3\u1790\u17c4\u1784}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Inao}}'' ({{lang|km|\u17a5\u178e\u17b6\u179c}}): [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Kakey}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17b6\u1780\u17b8}}): Kakati-Jataka\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Anoruth-Neang Usa}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u17a2\u1793\u17bb\u179a\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u1792-\u1793\u17b6\u1784\u17a7\u179f\u17b6}}): [[Aniruddha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Sopheak Leak}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u1797\u179b\u1780\u17d2\u1781\u178e\u17cd}}): [[Chitralekha (deity)|Chitralekha]]\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Samot}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u1798\u17bb\u1791\u17d2\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Sovannahong}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u17a0\u1784\u17d2\u179f}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Preah Sang}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179f\u17d0\u1784\u17d2\u1781}})\n}}\n\n=== Dances ===\n\nIn contrast to the dance dramas are shorter dances known as ''{{transl|km|robam}}''. They can serve several purposes, such as honoring, ritualistic functions (e.g. securing the kingdom's fortune and prosperity), and blessing. Spanning several minutes or so, not all these dances have storylines, although many ''robam'' are indeed excerpts from dance dramas such as ''{{transl|km|robam mekhala-reamso}}'' and ''{{transl|km|robam sovan macchha}}'' (the latter being from the ''{{transl|km|Reamker}}'').\n\nThe 'apsara dance' of today was created under the guidance of Queen Kossamak Nearireath. Its costume is based on the [[bas-relief]] of ''apsaras'' on temple ruins but much of it, including its music and gesture, is not unique from other classical Khmer dances that probably do not date back to the [[Angkor]] period.\n\n==== Select repertory of dances ====\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''{{transl|km|[[Robam Tep Apsara|Robam tep apsara]]}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1791\u17c1\u1796\u17a2\u1794\u17d2\u179f\u179a\u17b6}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Robam tep monorom}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1791\u17c1\u1796\u1798\u1793\u17c4\u179a\u1798\u17d2\u1799}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Robam chun por}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1787\u17bc\u1793\u1796\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Robam makar}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u1780\u179a}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Robam sovann maccha}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u179f\u17bb\u179c\u178e\u17d2\u178e\u1798\u1785\u17d2\u1786\u17b6}})\n* ''{{transl|km|Robam [[Manimekhala|mekhala]]-reamsor}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1798\u17c1\u1781\u179b\u17b6\u179a\u17b6\u1798\u179f\u17bc\u179a}}): also known as, ''{{transl|km|Robam [[Manimekhala|moni mekhala]]-ream eyso}}''\n}}\n\n== Glossary ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n;''{{transl|km|kbach}}'' ({{lang|km|\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785}}) : (lit., \"style\" or \"motif\") referring to a pose or gesture used in Khmer classical dance\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793}}) : (lit., \"theatre\"; also romanized as ''lakhaon'' and ''lkhaon''), referring to different genres of theatrical performances\n;''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179b\u17d2\u1781\u17c4\u1793\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799}}): (lit., \"theatre of royal wealth\") the Khmer name for the main classical dance drama of Cambodia; the royal ballet of Cambodia, in this case, the term ''lakhon'' may be substituted with ''robam''\n;''{{transl|km|robam}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6}}) : (lit., \"dance\"), a term used to refer to dances and in some contexts, all classical dances\n;''{{transl|km|robam kbach boran}}'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1780\u17d2\u1794\u17b6\u1785\u17cb\u1794\u17bc\u179a\u17b6\u178e}}): (lit., \"dance of the ancient style\") a term referring to classical dance that is used in the genres of theatre including ''{{transl|km|lakhon khol}}'', ''{{transl|km|lakhon pol srey}}'', and ''{{transl|km|lakhon preah reach trop}}''.

For example, a [[cubic centimetre]] (cm<sup>3</sup>) is the volume of a cube whose sides are one [[centimetre]] (1&nbsp;cm) in length.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre (m<sup>3</sup>).

Capacity is not identical in meaning to volume, though closely related; the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior. Units of capacity are the [[SI]] litre and its derived units, and Imperial units such as [[Gill (unit)|gill]], [[pint]], [[gallon]], and others. Units of volume are the cubes of [[units of length]]. In SI the units of volume and capacity are closely related: one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre, the capacity of a cube with a 10&nbsp;cm side. In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (an imperial gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).\n\nThe ''[[density]]'' of an object is defined as the ratio of the [[mass]] to the volume.<ref>{{OED|density}}</ref> The inverse of density is ''[[specific volume]]'' which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in [[thermodynamics]] where the [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume of a working fluid]] is often an important parameter of a system being studied.\n\nThe [[volumetric flow rate]] in [[fluid dynamics]] is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second [m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>]).\n\n== Volume in calculus ==\n{{further|Volume element}}\n\nIn [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the volume of a region ''D'' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is given by a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] of the constant [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x,y,z)=1</math> over the region and is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D 1 \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz.</math>\n\nIn [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]], the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz, </math>\n\nIn [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (using the convention for angles with <math>\\theta</math> as the azimuth and <math>\\varphi</math> measured from the polar axis; see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]]), the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D \\rho^2 \\sin\\varphi \\,d\\rho \\,d\\theta\\, d\\varphi .</math>\n\n== Volume formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius ''r'' is as follows.\n\nThe surface area of the circular disk is <math>\\pi r^2 </math>.\n\nThe radius of the circular disks, defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them, is\n: <math>y = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}</math>\n\nor\n: <math>z = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}</math>\n\nwhere y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value.\n\nUsing y as the disk radius, the volume of the sphere can be calculated as\n: <math> \\int_{-r}^r \\pi y^2 \\,dx = \\int_{-r}^r \\pi\\left(r^2 - x^2\\right) \\,dx.</math>\n\nNow\n: <math>\\int_{-r}^r \\pi r^2\\,dx - \\int_{-r}^r \\pi x^2\\,dx = \\pi \\left(r^3 + r^3\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\left(r^3 + r^3\\right) =  2\\pi r^3 - \\frac{2\\pi r^3}{3}.</math>\n\nCombining yields <math>V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.</math>\n\nThis formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the sphere's [[surface area]], which is <math>4\\pi r^2</math>. The volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells, and the sphere volume is equal to\n\n: <math> \\int_0^r 4\\pi r^2 \\,dr = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.</math>\n\n==== Cone ====\nThe cone is a type of pyramidal shape. The fundamental equation for pyramids, one-third times base times altitude, applies to cones as well.\n\nHowever, using calculus, the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is the [[integral]] of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] of thickness ''dx''. The calculation for the volume of a cone of height ''h'', whose base is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius ''r'', is as follows.\n\nThe radius of each circular disk is ''r'' if ''x'' = 0 and 0 if ''x'' = ''h'', and varying linearly in between\u2014that is,\n: <math>r \\frac{h - x}{h}.</math>\n\nThe surface area of the circular disk is then\n: <math> \\pi \\left(r\\frac{h - x}{h}\\right)^2 = \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2}. </math>\n\nThe volume of the cone can then be calculated as\n: <math> \\int_0^h \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2} dx, </math>\n\nand after extraction of the constants\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2} \\int_0^h (h - x)^2 dx</math>\n\nIntegrating gives us\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2}\\left(\\frac{h^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h.</math>\n\n==== Polyhedron ====\n{{main|Volume of a polyhedron}}\n\n== Volume in differential geometry ==\n{{main|Volume form}}\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a [[differential form]] of top degree (i.e., whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold) that is nowhere equal to zero.  A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]]. Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form.\n\nAn [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} \\, dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n ,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold, and <math>g</math> is the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold in terms of the same basis.\n\n== Volume in thermodynamics ==\n{{Main| Volume (thermodynamics)}}\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]\n* [[Conversion of units#Volume|Conversion of units]]\n* [[Dimensional weight]]\n* [[Dimensioning]]\n* [[Length]]\n* [[Measure (mathematics)|Measure]]\n* [[Perimeter]]\n* [[Volume (thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Volumography]]\n* [[Weight]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Ccat}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Geometry|Chapter 8|Perimeters, Areas, Volumes}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Calculus|Volume}}\n\n[[Category:Volume|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Quantity of three-dimensional space}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Infobox physical quantity\n| name = Volume\n| image = Simple Measuring Cup.jpg\n| caption = A [[measuring cup]] can be used to measure volumes of [[liquid]]s.

In other systems the conversion is not trivial; the capacity of a vehicle's fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet, for example, but in gallons (an imperial gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ft).\n\nThe ''[[density]]'' of an object is defined as the ratio of the [[mass]] to the volume.<ref>{{OED|density}}</ref> The inverse of density is ''[[specific volume]]'' which is defined as volume divided by mass. Specific volume is a concept important in [[thermodynamics]] where the [[volume (thermodynamics)|volume of a working fluid]] is often an important parameter of a system being studied.\n\nThe [[volumetric flow rate]] in [[fluid dynamics]] is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time (for example cubic meters per second [m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>\u22121</sup>]).\n\n== Volume in calculus ==\n{{further|Volume element}}\n\nIn [[calculus]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the volume of a region ''D'' in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> is given by a [[multiple integral|triple integral]] of the constant [[function (mathematics)|function]] <math>f(x,y,z)=1</math> over the region and is usually written as:\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D 1 \\,dx\\,dy\\,dz.</math>\n\nIn [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]], the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D r\\,dr\\,d\\theta\\,dz, </math>\n\nIn [[spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]] (using the convention for angles with <math>\\theta</math> as the azimuth and <math>\\varphi</math> measured from the polar axis; see more on [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions|conventions]]), the volume integral is\n\n:<math>\\iiint\\limits_D \\rho^2 \\sin\\varphi \\,d\\rho \\,d\\theta\\, d\\varphi .</math>\n\n== Volume formulas ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius ''r'' is as follows.\n\nThe surface area of the circular disk is <math>\\pi r^2 </math>.\n\nThe radius of the circular disks, defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them, is\n: <math>y = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}</math>\n\nor\n: <math>z = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}</math>\n\nwhere y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x value.\n\nUsing y as the disk radius, the volume of the sphere can be calculated as\n: <math> \\int_{-r}^r \\pi y^2 \\,dx = \\int_{-r}^r \\pi\\left(r^2 - x^2\\right) \\,dx.</math>\n\nNow\n: <math>\\int_{-r}^r \\pi r^2\\,dx - \\int_{-r}^r \\pi x^2\\,dx = \\pi \\left(r^3 + r^3\\right) - \\frac{\\pi}{3}\\left(r^3 + r^3\\right) =  2\\pi r^3 - \\frac{2\\pi r^3}{3}.</math>\n\nCombining yields <math>V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.</math>\n\nThis formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the sphere's [[surface area]], which is <math>4\\pi r^2</math>. The volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells, and the sphere volume is equal to\n\n: <math> \\int_0^r 4\\pi r^2 \\,dr = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3.</math>\n\n==== Cone ====\nThe cone is a type of pyramidal shape. The fundamental equation for pyramids, one-third times base times altitude, applies to cones as well.\n\nHowever, using calculus, the volume of a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] is the [[integral]] of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] of thickness ''dx''. The calculation for the volume of a cone of height ''h'', whose base is centered at (0, 0, 0) with radius ''r'', is as follows.\n\nThe radius of each circular disk is ''r'' if ''x'' = 0 and 0 if ''x'' = ''h'', and varying linearly in between\u2014that is,\n: <math>r \\frac{h - x}{h}.</math>\n\nThe surface area of the circular disk is then\n: <math> \\pi \\left(r\\frac{h - x}{h}\\right)^2 = \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2}. </math>\n\nThe volume of the cone can then be calculated as\n: <math> \\int_0^h \\pi r^2\\frac{(h - x)^2}{h^2} dx, </math>\n\nand after extraction of the constants\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2} \\int_0^h (h - x)^2 dx</math>\n\nIntegrating gives us\n: <math>\\frac{\\pi r^2}{h^2}\\left(\\frac{h^3}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi r^2 h.</math>\n\n==== Polyhedron ====\n{{main|Volume of a polyhedron}}\n\n== Volume in differential geometry ==\n{{main|Volume form}}\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]], a '''volume form''' on a [[differentiable manifold]] is a [[differential form]] of top degree (i.e., whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold) that is nowhere equal to zero.  A manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable. An orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms, since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form. On non-orientable manifolds, one may instead define the weaker notion of a [[Density on a manifold|density]]. Integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that form.\n\nAn [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-Riemannian]] [[manifold]] has a natural volume form.  In [[local coordinates]], it can be expressed as\n:<math>\\omega = \\sqrt{|g|} \\, dx^1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge dx^n ,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>dx^i</math> are [[1-form]]s that form a positively oriented basis for the [[cotangent bundle]] of the manifold, and <math>g</math> is the [[determinant]] of the matrix representation of the [[metric tensor]] on the manifold in terms of the same basis.\n\n== Volume in thermodynamics ==\n{{Main| Volume (thermodynamics)}}\n\nIn [[thermodynamics]], the '''volume''' of a [[thermodynamic system|system]] is an important [[extensive parameter]] for describing its [[thermodynamic state]]. The '''specific volume''', an [[intensive property]], is the system's volume per unit of mass. Volume is a [[function of state]] and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]]. For example, volume is related to the [[pressure]] and [[thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] of an [[ideal gas]] by the [[ideal gas law]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{cmn|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]]\n* [[Conversion of units#Volume|Conversion of units]]\n* [[Dimensional weight]]\n* [[Dimensioning]]\n* [[Length]]\n* [[Measure (mathematics)|Measure]]\n* [[Perimeter]]\n* [[Volume (thermodynamics)]]\n* [[Volumography]]\n* [[Weight]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Ccat}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Geometry|Chapter 8|Perimeters, Areas, Volumes}}\n* {{wikibooks-inline|Calculus|Volume}}\n\n[[Category:Volume|*]]\n", "name_user": "2600:8801:a00:48d:3d53:6dd6:44cc:7fb", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed capitalization)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"}

The team currently competes in The American Athletic Conference. The Mustangs made their most recent appearance in the NCAA National Tournament in 2018, their second consecutive tournament appearance and third in four seasons. In 2017, the Mustangs  reached the round of sixteen for the 18th time in program history. In 2017, they also became the first program in American Athletic Conference history to claim both the regular season and conference tournament championship, a feat they repeated in 2018 defeating Temple 2-1 in the final game of the regular season and defeating UCF in a shootout in Orlando in the AAC Tournament Final. The Mustangs have been one of the top men's collegiate sides in the NCAA since being founded in 1975, and are regularly featured in Top 25 polls. The Mustangs used to be coached by former [[FC Dallas]] and current Grand Canyon University coach [[Schellas Hyndman]] and current FC Dallas coach Luchi Gonzalez played for the Mustangs from 1998-2001.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 2006 season, the SMU men's soccer program was ranked No. 1 in the nation for four consecutive weeks. The team sat atop the four national polls with a record of 13-0-2 in the [[Adidas]]/NSCA poll, SoccerTimes.com poll, [[Soccer America Magazine]] poll, and the CollegeSoccerNews.com poll. Concurrently, the SMU women's soccer program cracked the top 25, at No. 22 in the Adidas/NSCA poll and No. 19 in the SoccerTimes.com poll.\n\nOn November 6, 2006, the SMU men's soccer team finished the regular season ranked No. 2 in the nation. Additionally, SMU won the C-USA title game, beating [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] 2-0 in [[Tulsa, OK|Tulsa]]. This C-USA championship win is the sixth conference title for SMU since 1997.\n\nThe SMU men's soccer team finished the 2010 season with an overall record of 16-2-2. The Mustangs finished the season strong with a trip to the Elite Eight where they lost to [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in a penalty kick shootout.\n\nIn 2015, the Mustangs were led by first year head coach Kevin Hudson to the regular season American Athletic Conference title and reached the Round of 16 in the NCAA National Tournament where they were eliminated by Akron 2-1.\n\nThe Mustangs finished the 2017 season ranked No. 10 in the [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]] Rankings with an overall record of 17-3-1. They became the first program in American Athletic Conference history to claim the \"double\", winning both the regular season and conference tournament when they defeated the University of Central Florida 2-1 in Dallas. On January 20, 2018 SMU had two players selected in the 2018 MLS draft with Michael Nelson being selected by the Huston Dynamo with the 20th overall pick and Mauro Cichero being selected by FC Dallas with the 29th overall pick. SMU Defender [[Jordan Cano]] signed as a homegrown player for FC Dallas prior to the draft bringing the total to three players entering the MLS from the 2017 team.\n\nCurrently, the team is ranked 5th in the nation.\n\nIn 2019, former Mustang Emil Cuello continued the trend of SMU players being selected in the first round when he was selected by the LA Galaxy with the 19th overall pick.\n\n== Stadium ==\n{{main|Westcott Field}}\nBuilt in 1994, [[Westcott Field]] is the home venue for the SMU Mustangs men's and women's soccer team. The stadium seats 4,000.<ref name=stadium>{{cite web|title=Facilities: Westcott Field|url=http://smumustangs.cstv.com/facilities/wescott-field.html|work=Southern Methodist University Athletics|publisher=CBSSports.com College Network|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Fans ==\n\n=== Rivalries ===\n{{see|SMU\u2013Tulsa men's soccer rivalry}}\nWhile SMU is traditionally rivals with TCU (Texas Christian University), University of Texas in Austin, Texas A&M, Rice, University of Houston and UTEP, these fellow schools do not fund varsity soccer programs, thus hindering the rivalry on the soccer field for the Mustangs. SMU and TCU were rivals when TCU did field a team for many years. TCU's team was an NCAA Division 1 program up until the enforcement of [[Title IX]] in the late 1990s to early 2000s. Due to the enforcement of Title IX, TCU lost their men's division 1 men's soccer program and it was converted to a club team only. TCU does continue to field a women's division 1 program. SMU and TCU played many battles throughout the years for the bragging rights of who was the stronger program in the Dallas/FT Worth metroplex. Generally, they would play one home and one away game against TCU per season. Some of the battles were very close but for the most part SMU was the stronger program due to the fact they had better funding for their soccer program (scholarship money) and thus were able to recruit higher level players. Currently, their main rivals in soccer due to geographic proximity are the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's soccer|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]] and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\n== Roster ==\n\n=== 2018\u201319 squad ===\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The team currently competes in The American Athletic Conference. The Mustangs made their most recent appearance in the NCAA National Tournament in 2018, their second consecutive tournament appearance and third in four seasons. In 2017, the Mustangs  reached the round of sixteen for the 18th time in program history. In 2017, they also became the first program in American Athletic Conference history to claim both the regular season and conference tournament championship, a feat they repeated in 2018 defeating Temple 2-1 in the final game of the regular season and defeating UCF in a shootout in Orlando in the AAC Tournament Final. The Mustangs have been one of the top men's collegiate sides in the NCAA since being founded in 1975, and are regularly featured in Top 25 polls. The Mustangs used to be coached by former [[FC Dallas]] and current Grand Canyon University coach [[Schellas Hyndman]] and current FC Dallas coach Luchi Gonzalez played for the Mustangs from 1998-2001.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 2006 season, the SMU men's soccer program was ranked No. 1 in the nation for four consecutive weeks. The team sat atop the four national polls with a record of 13-0-2 in the [[Adidas]]/NSCA poll, SoccerTimes.com poll, [[Soccer America Magazine]] poll, and the CollegeSoccerNews.com poll. Concurrently, the SMU women's soccer program cracked the top 25, at No. 22 in the Adidas/NSCA poll and No. 19 in the SoccerTimes.com poll.\n\nOn November 6, 2006, the SMU men's soccer team finished the regular season ranked No. 2 in the nation. Additionally, SMU won the C-USA title game, beating [[University of Kentucky|Kentucky]] 2-0 in [[Tulsa, OK|Tulsa]]. This C-USA championship win is the sixth conference title for SMU since 1997.\n\nThe SMU men's soccer team finished the 2010 season with an overall record of 16-2-2. The Mustangs finished the season strong with a trip to the Elite Eight where they lost to [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in a penalty kick shootout.\n\nIn 2015, the Mustangs were led by first year head coach Kevin Hudson to the regular season American Athletic Conference title and reached the Round of 16 in the NCAA National Tournament where they were eliminated by Akron 2-1.\n\nThe Mustangs finished the 2017 season ranked No. 10 in the [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]] Rankings with an overall record of 17-3-1. They became the first program in American Athletic Conference history to claim the \"double\", winning both the regular season and conference tournament when they defeated the University of Central Florida 2-1 in Dallas. On January 20, 2018 SMU had two players selected in the 2018 MLS draft with Michael Nelson being selected by the Huston Dynamo with the 20th overall pick and Mauro Cichero being selected by FC Dallas with the 29th overall pick. SMU Defender [[Jordan Cano]] signed as a homegrown player for FC Dallas prior to the draft bringing the total to three players entering the MLS from the 2017 team.\n\nCurrently, the team is ranked 5th in the nation.\n\nIn 2019, former Mustang Emil Cuello continued the trend of SMU players being selected in the first round when he was selected by the LA Galaxy with the 19th overall pick.\n\n== Stadium ==\n{{main|Westcott Field}}\nBuilt in 1994, [[Westcott Field]] is the home venue for the SMU Mustangs men's and women's soccer team. The stadium seats 4,000.<ref name=stadium>{{cite web|title=Facilities: Westcott Field|url=http://smumustangs.cstv.com/facilities/wescott-field.html|work=Southern Methodist University Athletics|publisher=CBSSports.com College Network|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Fans ==\n\n=== Rivalries ===\n{{see|SMU\u2013Tulsa men's soccer rivalry}}\nWhile SMU is traditionally rivals with TCU (Texas Christian University), University of Texas in Austin, Texas A&M, Rice, University of Houston and UTEP, these fellow schools do not fund varsity soccer programs, thus hindering the rivalry on the soccer field for the Mustangs. SMU and TCU were rivals when TCU did field a team for many years. TCU's team was an NCAA Division 1 program up until the enforcement of [[Title IX]] in the late 1990s to early 2000's. Due to the enforcement of Title IX, TCU lost their men's division 1 men's soccer program and it was converted to a club team only. TCU does continue to field a women's division 1 program. SMU and TCU played many battles throughout the years for the bragging rights of who was the stronger program in the Dallas/FT Worth metroplex. Generally, they would play one home and one away game against TCU per season. Some of the battles were very close but for the most part SMU was the stronger program due to the fact they had better funding for their soccer program (scholarship money) and thus were able to recruit higher level players. Currently, their main rivals in soccer due to geographic proximity are the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane men's soccer|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]] and Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas.\n\n== Roster ==\n\n=== 2018\u201319 squad ===\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Generally known as M.E. Thompson during his political career, he served as the 70th [[List of governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] from 1947 to 1948 and was elected as the first [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia]] in 1946. \n\n==Early life and education==\nThompson was born in [[Millen, Georgia]], to Henry Jackson Thompson and his wife Eva Edenfield Thompson. He was the youngest of seven children and his father died just after his first birthday. His father was a sharecropper. Thompson grew up in poverty, but through hard work and determination, he was able to leave the farm to pursue a higher education. He helped pay his way through college by working various jobs, including student teaching and the selling of bibles door to door. He graduated from [[Emory University]] in 1926, then earned a [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) from the [[University of Georgia]] in 1935. He also earned all of the credits for a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, but because his adviser died, he never argued his dissertation. Following his college career, Thompson worked in education, first as a teacher and coach, a principal, a district superintendent, moving all the way up to assistant school superintendent for the state. Thompson was a supporter of Governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and was hired as his Executive Secretary. Arnall then appointed him to the position of State Revenue Commissioner in 1945.\n\nIn 1946, Thompson ran for the newly created position of [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia]]. He won the election and became Georgia's first Lieutenant Governor. \n\n==Lieutenant Governor of Georgia==\nGovernor-elect [[Eugene Talmadge]] died in December 1946 and the [[Georgia (U.S. state) Constitution|Georgia state constitution]] was vague on who would be sworn in as governor, causing the [[Three Governors controversy]]. Thompson felt that as the lieutenant governor-elect, he should become the governor. But the state legislature was controlled by Talmadge supporters. They invoked a clause in the Georgia state constitution which allowed for the legislature to pick between the second- and third-place candidates. The people who finished second and third were two write-in candidates, James V. Carmichael and Eugene's son, [[Herman E. Talmadge]]. The legislature selected Herman Talmadge to become the governor. He would hold that position temporarily. \n\n==Governor of Georgia==\nThompson and Arnall both claimed the office of governor. Arnall later renounced his claim to support Thompson. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] ruled that Thompson was the legitimate governor and that the legislature had violated the state constitution by selecting Talmadge. Thompson's numerous achievements as the [[List of Governors of Georgia|70th Governor of Georgia]] include much needed improvements to highway infrastructure, public education, and the purchase of Jekyll Island, a beach retreat for the average Georgian. He was able to raise the salary of teachers, provide free books to students, and extend highschool to the 12th grade. His purchase of Jekyll Island for $675,000.00 is still considered to be one of the greatest real estate purchases made in U.S. history. Thompson was able to achieve many things during his shortened term, with very limited cooperation from the state legislature, and without raising taxes on the citizens of Georgia. \n\n==Later political activities==\nThompson unsuccessfully opposed Talmadge three additional times, twice in gubernatorial elections in 1950 and 1954 and finally in 1956 for one of Georgia's [[United States Senate]] seats. In the mid 1950s Thompson moved to [[Valdosta, Georgia]] where he transitioned into a successful career as a real estate developer. Thompson died at the age of 77 on October 3, 1980 in Valdosta. His family turned down an offer for him to lie in state, in the rotunda of the State Capitol. He is interred in a mausoleum at the McLane Riverview Memorial Gardens,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gashpo.org/assets/documents/ga_govs_graves_field_guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118235505/http://www.gashpo.org/assets/documents/ga_govs_graves_field_guide.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> in that same city.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Find a Grave|7961401}}\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/glynn/m.e.-thompson-and-the-purchase-of-jekyll-island M.E.

Generally known as M.E. Thompson during his political career, he served as the 70th [[List of governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] from 1947 to 1948 and was elected as the first [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia]] in 1946. \n\n==Early life and education==\nThompson was born in [[Millen, Georgia]], to Henry Jackson Thompson and his wife Eva Edenfield Thompson. He was the youngest of seven children and his father died just after his first birthday. His father was a sharecropper. Thompson grew up in poverty, but through hard work and determination, he was able to leave the farm to pursue a higher education. He helped pay his way through college by working various jobs, including student teaching and the selling of bibles door to door. He graduated from [[Emory University]] in 1926, then earned a [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.) from the [[University of Georgia]] in 1935. He also earned all of the credits for a Ph.D. from the University of Georgia, but because his adviser died, he never argued his dissertation. Following his college career, Thompson worked in education, first as a teacher and coach, a principal, a district superintendent, moving all the way up to assistant school superintendent for the state. Thompson was a supporter of Governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and was hired as his Executive Secretary. Arnall then appointed him to the position of State Revenue Commissioner in 1945.\n\nIn 1946, Thompson ran for the newly created position of [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia]]. He won the election and became Georgia's first Lieutenant Governor. \n\n==Lieutenant Governor of Georgia==\nGovernor-elect [[Eugene Talmadge]] died in December 1946 and the [[Georgia (U.S. state) Constitution|Georgia state constitution]] was vague on who would be sworn in as governor, causing the [[Three Governors controversy]]. Thompson felt that as the lieutenant governor-elect, he should become the governor. But the state legislature was controlled by Talmadge supporters. They invoked a clause in the Georgia state constitution which allowed for the legislature to pick between the second- and third-place candidates. The people who finished second and third were two write-in candidates, James V. Carmichael and Eugene's son, [[Herman E. Talmadge]]. The legislature selected Herman Talmadge to become the governor. He would hold that position temporarily. \n\n==Governor of Georgia==\nThompson and Arnall both claimed the office of governor. Arnall later renounced his claim to support Thompson. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] ruled that Thompson was the legitimate governor and that the legislature had violated the state constitution by selecting Talmadge. Thompson's numerous achievements as the [[List of Governors of Georgia|70th Governor of Georgia]] include much needed improvements to highway infrastructure, public education, and the purchase of Jekyll Island, a beach retreat for the average Georgian. He was able to raise the salary of teachers, provide free books to students, and extend highschool to the 12th grade. His purchase of Jekyll Island for $675,000.00 is still considered to be one of the greatest real estate purchases made in U.S. history. Thompson was able to achieve many things during his shortened term, with very limited cooperation from the state legislature, and without raising taxes on the citizens of Georgia. \n\n==Later political activities==\nThompson unsuccessfully opposed Talmadge three additional times, twice in gubernatorial elections in 1950 and 1954 and finally in 1956 for one of Georgia's [[United States Senate]] seats. In the mid 1950s Thompson moved to [[Valdosta, Georgia]] where he transitioned into a successful career as a real estate developer. Thompson died at the age of 77 on October 3, 1980 in Valdosta. His family turned down an offer for him to lie in state, in the rotunda of the State Capitol. He is interred in a mausoleum at the McLane Riverview Memorial Gardens,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gashpo.org/assets/documents/ga_govs_graves_field_guide.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118235505/http://www.gashpo.org/assets/documents/ga_govs_graves_field_guide.pdf |archivedate=2006-01-18 }}</ref> in that same city.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Find a Grave|7961401}}\n* [http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/topics/historical_markers/county/glynn/m.e.-thompson-and-the-purchase-of-jekyll-island M.E.
