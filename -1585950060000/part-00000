The series was originally set up at [[20th Century Fox Television]] for its primetime premiere on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], which previously commissioned Parker and Stone to develop the short. However, FOX was not pleased with the show's inclusion of Mr. Hankey, a talking poo character, and felt it wouldn't bode well with viewers. The network's executives also said that placing kids as the stars could not be as funny and popular as it would with the grown-ups and families, like ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[King of the Hill]].''<ref name=\"DWAE\">{{cite web|url=https://glamourfame.com/fox-refused-south-park-1997-because-one-character|title=Fox Refused to Take 'South Park' in 1997 Because of One Character, and Something Else as well|work=Glamour Fame|date=September 18, 2019|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2480397/that-time-fox-refused-to-pick-up-south-park-because-of-mr-hankey|title=That Time Fox Refused To Pick Up South Park Because Of Mr. Hankey|last=Ashton|first=Will|work=CinemaBlend|date=September 17, 2019|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/36709/d-oh-fox-turned-down-south-park|title=D'oh!

It is revealed that each time he dies, Kenny's mom spontaneously gives birth to him, and then is put back in his orange parka and in bed, to regenerate overnight. This was due to his parents\u2019 involvement in the cult of [[Cthulhu]], whose meetings they would only attend because of the parties. \n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Butters Stotch===\n\n{{main|Butters Stotch}}\nVoiced by [[Matt Stone]];\nLeopold \"Butters\" Stotch is cheerful, naive, optimistic, sweet-natured, gullible and more passive relative to the show's other child characters, and can become increasingly anxious, especially when faced with the likelihood of his parents' punishments, which is usually being grounded, usually for no good reason, such as when Butters threatened to \"kill\" himself as part of a scheme by Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman, and his parents said they would \"only\" ground him for two weeks if he came down. Butters usually doesn't indulge in foul-mouthed language like the other children and speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as \"nerdy\" and he obliviously maintains a very wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters from both his classmates and parents. His happy-go-lucky persona has been described as resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character and is usually presented in stark contrast to the harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, Butters appeared initially as a background character in first the episode, \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\", but gradually became one of Parker and Stone's favorite characters. Besides wanting to genuinely surprise fans, Parker and Stone killed Kenny at the end of season five to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters, as his following episode, revolves entirely around him. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman allow him into their group as the \"fourth friend\", but eventually adopts his super-villain alter ego of Professor Chaos, whom, in spite of his name, only seems to be able to screw things up that either nobody takes notice of, or can be easily resolved. Despite this, Butters has continued to be a major character in recent seasons and continues to be a frequent source of help to Cartman, while also being the main victim of Cartman's constant pranking and manipulation.\n\n===Randy and Sharon Marsh===\n\n{{main|Randy and Sharon Marsh}}\nRandy Marsh is Stan's father and the most prominent adult character in the show. He is 45 years old, and like Parker's father, is a [[geologist]], making his first appearance in the series while monitoring a [[seismometer]] in the episode \"[[Volcano (South Park)|Volcano]]\". He was depicted to work at the South Park Center for Seismic Activity, and was later shown to work for the [[U. S. Geological Survey]]. He was briefly fired from his geologist job near the end of the 12th season, and quit briefly during the end of the 14th season, but has since been-rehired both times. He also serves on the [[city council]], specializing in the town's parks and public grounds.\n\nA recurring character trait of Randy's is his being prone to overreacting and obsessively seizing upon irrational ideas and fads, whether by himself or as part of a large contingent of the town's adult population.\n\nThough the show frequently depicts him to be a moderate to heavy drinker, numerous episodes have dealt with Randy's belligerent and negligent behavior brought upon by his severe intoxication.\n\nA few instances of personal achievement have made Randy a hero in the eyes of his friends and fellow townsfolk, such as being awarded a [[Nobel Prize]], and twice setting a record for producing the world's largest piece of human [[Defecation|excrement]]. Randy has conversely been subjected to ridicule from the entire town, ranging from when he inadvertently accelerated the effects of [[global warming]] by suggesting the entire populace take on a more uninhibited approach to [[Flatulence|passing gas]] in order to avoid the hazard of [[Spontaneous human combustion|spontaneous combustion]], to when he reluctantly exclaimed \"[[niggers]]\" while attempting to solve a puzzle during a live broadcast of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. In addition to the professional singing he did in his youth, Randy can also play guitar, as seen in \"[[Guitar Queer-O]]\". He can also speak little Mongolian, having learned some in college, as seen in the episode \"[[Child Abduction Is Not Funny]]\".\n\nThe episode \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" revealed that Randy produces music and performs as the noted musician [[Lorde]], a fact that was explored subsequently in \"[[The Cissy]]\" . This has become a running gag that has continued through multiple episodes, such as suggesting much of the Marsh family's income comes from his music career as Lorde rather than his geology job. As of season 22, Randy quit his job and moved the family to the countryside where he sets up Tegridy Farms to grow and distribute cannabis.\n\n===Mr. Garrison===\n\n{{main|Mr. Garrison}}\nHerbert J. Garrison, formerly known as Janet Garrison,<ref>He is addressed by this name after his sex-change operation from \"[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]\" up until \"[[Eek, A Penis!]]\"</ref> was depicted primarily as a teacher until his dismissal, and then mounted a campaign that resulted in his election as President of the United States. Garrison is particularly [[cynical]], especially in comparison with the rest of South Park's adults, and he is one of the few characters to ever break the [[fourth wall]] on the show.\n\nFor the first eight seasons of the series, the character was known as Mr. Garrison.  He underwent a sex change in the season 9 premiere \"[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]\". The character was thereafter known to the other characters as Janet Garrison or Mrs. Garrison, despite being unmarried. In the season 12 episode \"[[Eek, a Penis!]]\", he undergoes yet another sex change operation, returning to being a man.\n\nMr. Garrison was in part inspired by a kindergarten teacher who taught Trey Parker, and who used a puppet named Mr. Hat as a teaching resource.  Mr. Garrison was also inspired by a [[British literature]] professor Parker had at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]; Parker said the voice he uses for the character is a dead-accurate impression of him. Parker said he believes Mr. Garrison has become one of the most complex characters on ''South Park'', particularly due to his ever-growing relationship with Mr. Hat and his sexuality and gender issues; Parker said of Mr. Garrison, \"He's the [[soap opera]] element to the whole series. [He] has a real story going on.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\">{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Weight Gain 4000\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\n===Wendy Testaburger===\n\n{{main|Wendy Testaburger}} \nWendy Testaburger is the show's most prominent female student. Her best friend is [[#Bebe Stevens|Bebe Stevens]], she is the on-and-off girlfriend of [[#Stan Marsh|Stan]]. Wendy has previously been voiced by [[Karri Turner]] (in the unaired pilot), [[Mary Kay Bergman]], [[Mona Marshall]], [[Eliza Schneider]], and is currently voiced by [[April Stewart]]. Fellow co-creator [[Matt Stone]] has also cited the name of Wendy Westerberg, the wife of an old friend from his childhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\"/> She wears a pink beret and a purple coat. She has long black hair with uneven bangs. Wendy made her first appearance unnamed, but clearly recognizable, in \"[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]\".\n\nLike her boyfriend Stan, Wendy is mature for her age, critical of popular trends, moral and intellectual, as well as being a [[feminist]], as noted in many of her appearances. She campaigns in several episodes on causes such as [[breast cancer]] and the suffering of [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s, often arguing with [[Eric Cartman]] who calls her a \"bitch\" or \"ho\" in response. Although the two generally only argue, he pushes her to the limit in the [[South Park (season 12)|Season 12 (2008)]] episode \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" wherein the two engage in a fight on the playground, in which Wendy badly beats up Cartman.\n\nWendy is known to be protective of her relationship with Stan. In the [[South Park (season 1)|Season 1 (1997)]] episode \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\" when Stan, along with the other boys, falls in love with an attractive substitute teacher, with Wendy accusing her of stealing Stan from her, eventually formulating a complex plan to get her thrown into the [[sun]]. She also sometimes displays jealousy \u2013 in the [[South Park (season 6)|Season 6 (2002)]] episode \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", her best friend, Bebe Stevens, receives more attention than she does because of Bebe's developing breasts. Wendy then gets breast implants, but the boys end up ridiculing her after only just realizing the control Bebe's breasts had on them. This behavior is somewhat contradicted by episodes such as \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" and \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" where she is more concerned with principles than trends and attention.\n\nWendy is very prominent in the show's earlier seasons, usually quarreling with [[Eric Cartman]] or reinforcing her relationship with Stan. She speaks in several episodes (especially in the first season) and is often chosen to help the boys out over her classmates. Wendy and Stan's relationship received less focus over the course of the [[South Park (season 5)|Season 5 (2001)]], and she has only one minor role in [[South Park (season 6)|Season 6 (2002)]]. This culminates in her breakup with Stan and pairing with Token Black in \"[[Raisins (South Park)|Raisins]]\", after which she makes only scattered prominent appearances until the end of the eleventh season, where she gets back together with Stan in \"[[The List (South Park)|The List]]\". They subsequently pair up as partners on a field trip in \"[[Super Fun Time]]\", she beats Cartman in a fight in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" and in the episode \"[[Elementary School Musical (South Park)|Elementary School Musical]]\" Stan suspects that she may leave him for a popular boy called Bridon. Wendy is able to kiss Stan on the cheek in \"[[Elementary School Musical (South Park)|Elementary School Musical]]\" without his previous nauseated reaction.\n\nWendy was voted student council president, something first noted in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" and re-addressed seven seasons later in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\", when Cartman becomes the morning announcer and starts spreading defaming comments about her\u2014most notably her supposed [[genocide]] of the [[Smurfs]]. In response to the allegations, Wendy becomes a guest on Cartman's morning show and manipulates his own story of the Smurf holocaust before announcing her resignation and electing him as the new school council president, effectively relieving him of his morning announcement job. Throughout the episode, Stan solidly defends her.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Significant characters===\n{{Main|List of students at South Park Elementary|List of South Park families|List of South Park Elementary staff}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Character\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Voiced by\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:44%;\"| Role\n! style=\"width:21%;\"| First appearance\n|-\n| [[Bebe Stevens]]\n| [[Jennifer Howell]]<ref name=\"faq-23apr2002\" /> || The boys' [[blond]]e, female classmate and Wendy's best friend.\n| \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\"<ref name=official2009>{{cite book|isbn=978-0762435616|page=|title=The South Park Episode Guide Seasons 1-5: The Official Companion to the Outrageous Plots, Shocking Language, Skewed Celebrities, and Awesome Animation, Volume 1|authors=Parker, Trey; Stone, Matt|publisher=Seal Press|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usoiqS4jT-wC&dq}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Bradley Biggle]]\n| [[Matt Stone]] ||One of the boys' classmates, who appears as a background character in most episodes until \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\"\n| \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\"<ref name=official2009/>\n|-\n| [[Clyde Donovan]]\n| [[Trey Parker]]<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=4&year=2001 |title=FAQ: April 2001 |accessdate=2008-10-13 |date=2001-04-30 |publisher=southparkstudios.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328120915/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=4&year=2001 |archivedate=2009-03-28 }}</ref> || One of the boys' classmates and considered himself as the cutest of the class.

It is revealed that each time he dies, Kenny\u2019s mom spontaneously gives birth to him, and then is put back in his orange parka and in bed, to regenerate overnight. This was due to his parents\u2019 involvement in the cult of [[Cthulhu]], whose meetings they would only attend because of the parties. \n\n==Secondary characters==\n\n===Butters Stotch===\n\n{{main|Butters Stotch}}\nVoiced by [[Matt Stone]];\nLeopold \"Butters\" Stotch is cheerful, naive, optimistic, sweet-natured, gullible and more passive relative to the show's other child characters, and can become increasingly anxious, especially when faced with the likelihood of his parents' punishments, which is usually being grounded, usually for no good reason, such as when Butters threatened to \"kill\" himself as part of a scheme by Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman, and his parents said they would \"only\" ground him for two weeks if he came down. Butters usually doesn't indulge in foul-mouthed language like the other children and speaks with a mild stutter and tends to fidget with his hands. The other characters perceive him as \"nerdy\" and he obliviously maintains a very wholesome attitude and mild disposition despite the tragedy and abuse that he frequently encounters from both his classmates and parents. His happy-go-lucky persona has been described as resembling that of a typical 1950s sitcom child character and is usually presented in stark contrast to the harsh treatment he receives at the hands of his friends and strict parents, Butters appeared initially as a background character in first the episode, \"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\", but gradually became one of Parker and Stone's favorite characters. Besides wanting to genuinely surprise fans, Parker and Stone killed Kenny at the end of season five to allow an opportunity to provide a major role for Butters, as his following episode, revolves entirely around him. Stan, Kyle, and Cartman allow him into their group as the \"fourth friend\", but eventually adopts his super-villain alter ego of Professor Chaos, whom, in spite of his name, only seems to be able to screw things up that either nobody takes notice of, or can be easily resolved. Despite this, Butters has continued to be a major character in recent seasons and continues to be a frequent source of help to Cartman, while also being the main victim of Cartman's constant pranking and manipulation.\n\n===Randy and Sharon Marsh===\n\n{{main|Randy and Sharon Marsh}}\nRandy Marsh is Stan's father and the most prominent adult character in the show. He is 45 years old, and like Parker's father, is a [[geologist]], making his first appearance in the series while monitoring a [[seismometer]] in the episode \"[[Volcano (South Park)|Volcano]]\". He was depicted to work at the South Park Center for Seismic Activity, and was later shown to work for the [[U. S. Geological Survey]]. He was briefly fired from his geologist job near the end of the 12th season, and quit briefly during the end of the 14th season, but has since been-rehired both times. He also serves on the [[city council]], specializing in the town's parks and public grounds.\n\nA recurring character trait of Randy's is his being prone to overreacting and obsessively seizing upon irrational ideas and fads, whether by himself or as part of a large contingent of the town's adult population.\n\nThough the show frequently depicts him to be a moderate to heavy drinker, numerous episodes have dealt with Randy's belligerent and negligent behavior brought upon by his severe intoxication.\n\nA few instances of personal achievement have made Randy a hero in the eyes of his friends and fellow townsfolk, such as being awarded a [[Nobel Prize]], and twice setting a record for producing the world's largest piece of human [[Defecation|excrement]]. Randy has conversely been subjected to ridicule from the entire town, ranging from when he inadvertently accelerated the effects of [[global warming]] by suggesting the entire populace take on a more uninhibited approach to [[Flatulence|passing gas]] in order to avoid the hazard of [[Spontaneous human combustion|spontaneous combustion]], to when he reluctantly exclaimed \"[[niggers]]\" while attempting to solve a puzzle during a live broadcast of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. In addition to the professional singing he did in his youth, Randy can also play guitar, as seen in \"[[Guitar Queer-O]]\". He can also speak little Mongolian, having learned some in college, as seen in the episode \"[[Child Abduction Is Not Funny]]\".\n\nThe episode \"[[Gluten Free Ebola]]\" revealed that Randy produces music and performs as the noted musician [[Lorde]], a fact that was explored subsequently in \"[[The Cissy]]\" . This has become a running gag that has continued through multiple episodes, such as suggesting much of the Marsh family's income comes from his music career as Lorde rather than his geology job. As of season 22, Randy quit his job and moved the family to the countryside where he sets up Tegridy Farms to grow and distribute cannabis.\n\n===Mr. Garrison===\n\n{{main|Mr. Garrison}}\nHerbert J. Garrison, formerly known as Janet Garrison,<ref>He is addressed by this name after his sex-change operation from \"[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]\" up until \"[[Eek, A Penis!]]\"</ref> was depicted primarily as a teacher until his dismissal, and then mounted a campaign that resulted in his election as President of the United States. Garrison is particularly [[cynical]], especially in comparison with the rest of South Park's adults, and he is one of the few characters to ever break the [[fourth wall]] on the show.\n\nFor the first eight seasons of the series, the character was known as Mr. Garrison.  He underwent a sex change in the season 9 premiere \"[[Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina]]\". The character was thereafter known to the other characters as Janet Garrison or Mrs. Garrison, despite being unmarried. In the season 12 episode \"[[Eek, a Penis!]]\", he undergoes yet another sex change operation, returning to being a man.\n\nMr. Garrison was in part inspired by a kindergarten teacher who taught Trey Parker, and who used a puppet named Mr. Hat as a teaching resource.  Mr. Garrison was also inspired by a [[British literature]] professor Parker had at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]; Parker said the voice he uses for the character is a dead-accurate impression of him. Parker said he believes Mr. Garrison has become one of the most complex characters on ''South Park'', particularly due to his ever-growing relationship with Mr. Hat and his sexuality and gender issues; Parker said of Mr. Garrison, \"He's the [[soap opera]] element to the whole series. [He] has a real story going on.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\">{{cite video | people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=2003|title=South Park: The Complete First Season: \"Weight Gain 4000\"|format=Audio commentary |medium=CD|publisher=Comedy Central}}</ref>\n\n===Wendy Testaburger===\n\n{{main|Wendy Testaburger}} \nWendy Testaburger is the show's most prominent female student. Her best friend is [[#Bebe Stevens|Bebe Stevens]], she is the on-and-off girlfriend of [[#Stan Marsh|Stan]]. Wendy has previously been voiced by [[Karri Turner]] (in the unaired pilot), [[Mary Kay Bergman]], [[Mona Marshall]], [[Eliza Schneider]], and is currently voiced by [[April Stewart]]. Fellow co-creator [[Matt Stone]] has also cited the name of Wendy Westerberg, the wife of an old friend from his childhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\"/> She wears a pink beret and a purple coat. She has long black hair with uneven bangs. Wendy made her first appearance unnamed, but clearly recognizable, in \"[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]\".\n\nLike her boyfriend Stan, Wendy is mature for her age, critical of popular trends, moral and intellectual, as well as being a [[feminist]], as noted in many of her appearances. She campaigns in several episodes on causes such as [[breast cancer]] and the suffering of [[Bottlenose dolphin]]s, often arguing with [[Eric Cartman]] who calls her a \"bitch\" or \"ho\" in response. Although the two generally only argue, he pushes her to the limit in the [[South Park (season 12)|Season 12 (2008)]] episode \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" wherein the two engage in a fight on the playground, in which Wendy badly beats up Cartman.\n\nWendy is known to be protective of her relationship with Stan. In the [[South Park (season 1)|Season 1 (1997)]] episode \"[[Tom's Rhinoplasty]]\" when Stan, along with the other boys, falls in love with an attractive substitute teacher, with Wendy accusing her of stealing Stan from her, eventually formulating a complex plan to get her thrown into the [[sun]]. She also sometimes displays jealousy \u2013 in the [[South Park (season 6)|Season 6 (2002)]] episode \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\", her best friend, Bebe Stevens, receives more attention than she does because of Bebe's developing breasts. Wendy then gets breast implants, but the boys end up ridiculing her after only just realizing the control Bebe's breasts had on them. This behavior is somewhat contradicted by episodes such as \"[[Stupid Spoiled Whore Video Playset]]\" and \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\" where she is more concerned with principles than trends and attention.\n\nWendy is very prominent in the show's earlier seasons, usually quarreling with [[Eric Cartman]] or reinforcing her relationship with Stan. She speaks in several episodes (especially in the first season) and is often chosen to help the boys out over her classmates. Wendy and Stan's relationship received less focus over the course of the [[South Park (season 5)|Season 5 (2001)]], and she has only one minor role in [[South Park (season 6)|Season 6 (2002)]]. This culminates in her breakup with Stan and pairing with Token Black in \"[[Raisins (South Park)|Raisins]]\", after which she makes only scattered prominent appearances until the end of the eleventh season, where she gets back together with Stan in \"[[The List (South Park)|The List]]\". They subsequently pair up as partners on a field trip in \"[[Super Fun Time]]\", she beats Cartman in a fight in \"[[Breast Cancer Show Ever]]\" and in the episode \"[[Elementary School Musical (South Park)|Elementary School Musical]]\" Stan suspects that she may leave him for a popular boy called Bridon. Wendy is able to kiss Stan on the cheek in \"[[Elementary School Musical (South Park)|Elementary School Musical]]\" without his previous nauseated reaction.\n\nWendy was voted student council president, something first noted in \"[[Bebe's Boobs Destroy Society]]\" and re-addressed seven seasons later in \"[[Dances with Smurfs]]\", when Cartman becomes the morning announcer and starts spreading defaming comments about her\u2014most notably her supposed [[genocide]] of the [[Smurfs]]. In response to the allegations, Wendy becomes a guest on Cartman's morning show and manipulates his own story of the Smurf holocaust before announcing her resignation and electing him as the new school council president, effectively relieving him of his morning announcement job. Throughout the episode, Stan solidly defends her.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Significant characters===\n{{Main|List of students at South Park Elementary|List of South Park families|List of South Park Elementary staff}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Character\n! style=\"width:22%;\"| Voiced by\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:44%;\"| Role\n! style=\"width:21%;\"| First appearance\n|-\n| [[Bebe Stevens]]\n| [[Jennifer Howell]]<ref name=\"faq-23apr2002\" /> || The boys' [[blond]]e, female classmate and Wendy's best friend.\n| \"[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]\"<ref name=official2009>{{cite book|isbn=978-0762435616|page=|title=The South Park Episode Guide Seasons 1-5: The Official Companion to the Outrageous Plots, Shocking Language, Skewed Celebrities, and Awesome Animation, Volume 1|authors=Parker, Trey; Stone, Matt|publisher=Seal Press|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=usoiqS4jT-wC&dq}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Bradley Biggle]]\n| [[Matt Stone]] ||One of the boys' classmates, who appears as a background character in most episodes until \"[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]\"\n| \"[[Rainforest Shmainforest]]\"<ref name=official2009/>\n|-\n| [[Clyde Donovan]]\n| [[Trey Parker]]<ref name=autogenerated3>{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=4&year=2001 |title=FAQ: April 2001 |accessdate=2008-10-13 |date=2001-04-30 |publisher=southparkstudios.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328120915/http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=4&year=2001 |archivedate=2009-03-28 }}</ref> || One of the boys' classmates and considered himself as the cutest of the class.

{"title_page": "List of Mr. Pickles characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Mr. Pickles'' characters}}\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2017}}\nThe following is a list of characters from the series ''[[Mr. Pickles]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Momma Named Me Sheriff]]''.\n\n==Main characters==\n===Mr. Pickles===\n'''Mr. Pickles''' (voiced by Dave Stewart in the Season 3 Finale) is the titular [[protagonist]] and the Goodman family's pet [[Border Collie]], revealed the Season four to be descended from a bloodline of dogs that are physical [[Incarnation|embodiment]] of the [[Devil]] that ruled over an island nation that previously sacrificed dogs. Through reasons unknown, Mr. Pickles ended up in Old Town and living with the Goodman family - named by Tommy for his love of eating [[pickled cucumber|pickles]]. He also enjoys mutilating, killing and engaging in sexual debauchery with those who pose a threat to Tommy or other protagonists. Mr. Pickles is highly intelligent and possesses incredible strength, surgical skills that he uses to mutilate his victims, the ability to steal from an evil scientist, a high-tech [[Android (robot)|android]], and demonic powers which allow him to control local animals to do his bidding (it is shown in one episode of Season 3 that he can't control snakes due to them having no ears to hear his demonic commands but learns to control them through vibrations). Despite his evil ways, he loves and is extremely protective of the impressionable young Tommy and his family: protecting them from danger, and often killing those who might do them harm, such as murdering a group of [[pedophilia|pedophile]]s or turning an unlicensed [[breast surgery|breast surgeon]] who gave Tommy [[breast implant]]s into a multiple-breasted freak. He has a long-standing feud with Henry Gobbleblobber, the only Goodman family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. While Mr. Pickles does not actually harm Henry, the dog does put the old man in humiliating situations while making him seem crazy to everyone else. Despite their adversarial nature, Mr. Pickles has saved Henry from being lobotomized while he was committed to an asylum and a cannibalistic serial killer that Henry had befriended, unaware he was an escaped convict and serial killer. Mr. Pickles has also shown to be sexually attracted to Tommy's mother by often groping, touching her private areas, and even playfully dry-humping her.\n\nMr. Pickles' doghouse leads to a hidden, underground lair that's filled with blood, pentagrams, victims \u2013 both living slaves and dead, mutilated bodies \u2013 and a throne where he usually eats his pickles. Many of the series' one-time characters usually end up in his lair where they are either killed or kept as prisoners. Henry is the only person shown to be able to enter Mr. Pickles' lair and survive repeatedly as nobody believes him due to his tales. He is responsible for turning Henry's wife Agnes into Steve, which is implied to have been due to her promising to do anything he wanted her to. Mr. Pickles and Agnes work together to stop Henry from revealing the truth by having Agnes pretend she has amnesia, but their plan hits a snag when Henry takes her to a memory download service which is actually a blackmailing scam run by a group of hackers. Agnes angers Mr. Pickles when she almost blows everything while being confronted by her daughter and Henry over her failed attempt to seduce Stanley into having an affair which had been revealed by Tommy. She is killed by a passing truck but Mr. Pickles revives her and sends her on one last mission to destroy the satellite which contains a backup file of her memories. Though it is implied that Agnes became Steve because Mr. Pickles threatened to kill her, Mr. Pickles sheds a tear as he shoots Steve into space, indicating that he did come to care for her.\n\nHe also works well with Beverly when Stanley and his coworkers are kidnapped and ends up saving her, Stanley, and his coworkers from their captors showing that he is just as protective of Tommy's parents. In the Season 3 Finale, Mr. Pickles chases Henry down to his cabin after he moves away, intending to lessen his credibility further by making it seem he can talk via a speaker for one of his spare Steves to speak through. But Mr. Pickles decides to frame Henry for mass murder instead after the old man attempted to kill him, with Henry escaping the Sheriff and finding Mr. Pickles's ancestral home where he and one of Mr. Pickles's servant conduct a scheme to kill him. Though Mr. Pickles appeared to outwit and seemingly killed Henry by switching bodies with the owner of a show dog he was making love with, he ends up being killed for real as Henry used the same spell to switch bodies with Mr. Pickles's servant and then the show dog. However, the show dog gives birth to a female puppy that Tommy names \"Mrs. Pickles\".\n\n===Tommy Goodman===\n'''Tommy Goodman''' (voiced by [[Kaitlyn Robrock]]) is the Goodman family's physically disabled young son. He is 6-year-old, wears [[Orthotics|leg-braces]] and considers Mr. Pickles as his best friend, often feeding him pickles whenever he behaves. Tommy is often protected by Mr. Pickles and is protective of Mr. Pickles as well, such as when he took it upon himself to search for Mr. Pickles after he was kidnapped by mercenaries. Due to his na\u00efve personality, Tommy usually gets involved in dangerous situations and Mr. Pickles (at times frustrated) steps in to save him and dispose of the bad people involved. Like most characters on the show, Tommy is unaware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. At one point in season two, Mr. Pickles spends most of the episode away from Tommy; this results in Tommy getting involved in a series of accidents, causing him to scorn Mr. Pickles and not give him a pickle. However, in Season 3's opening, he returns to his friendly nature after finding his grandmother Agnes. Agnes, however, shows contempt for Tommy, calling him a stupid boy even while pretending to be amnesiac.\n\n===Stanley Goodman===\n'''Stanley Goodman''' (voiced by [[Jay Johnston]]) is Tommy's father who works as a [[Telemarketing|telemarketer]]. Stanley is constantly bullied by his boss; as a result, Stanley hardly has time to spend with his family, especially his son. Nevertheless, Stanley means well and is committed to his family. Though they don't interact much, Mr. Pickles seems to respect him to a degree. He even showed displeasure when it looked as though a doctor was about to bring Stanley harm. In the opening of Season 3, it is revealed that he once laid naked with his mother-in-law Agnes, which is revealed by Tommy when he had all the town's memories uploaded into his mind. However, Agnes reveals that he refused to have sex with her when she tried to seduce him.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', he quits his job as a telemarketer and became deputy where he works under the Sheriff.\n\n===Beverly Goodman===\n'''Beverly Goodman''' (voiced by [[Brooke Shields]]) is Tommy's stay-at-home mother who is the traditional dutiful mother and wife. Beverly is oblivious of Mr. Pickles' evil nature and dismisses the dog's sexual behavior, for instance groping and touching her, as simple dog mannerisms. Like her son, Beverly is very na\u00efve and sometimes feels limited by her home life. Despite being the first person to dismiss her father's stories about Mr. Pickles, she is very close to him as he is one of the few people she can talk to. Near the end of the second season, she's shown to be very tired of her domestic duties and had a strained relationship with her mother, who prevented Beverley from following her dreams. In Season 3, she returns to her normal self after Agnes is found by Tommy unaware it was to prevent her father from revealing that Agnes was Steven. She hopes to reconnect with her mother despite believing she has amnesia. When it is revealed that Agnes had lied naked next to her husband, she is angered at Stanley and her mother, though Agnes reveals in anger that Stanley refused her attempts to seduce him before she is killed by a passing truck. However Agnes' death seems to give her some closure thanks to the knowledge that Stanley chose to remain faithful to her and their marriage. She and Stanley decide to tell Tommy that his grandmother is in a better place as he is unaware of her death. In Season 3 she is shown to be more assertive and capable, even working together with Mr. Pickles to rescue her husband when he is kidnapped together with his coworkers by an insane telemarketer-hating plantation owner. She is also capable of constructing a motorcycle from household items and even fight off a motorcycle gang all by herself. However, she has a habit of damaging her husband's trunk every time she drives even when she does not drive the truck itself, as she ends up damaging it with her makeshift motorcycle after it is hit by a bowling ball thrown by the Sheriff. However, she retains her kind-hearted personality when she refuses to punish Tommy's bullies physically as she doesn't condone corporal punishment or violence against children.\n\n===Henry Gobbleblobber===\n'''Henry Gobbleblobber''' (voiced by [[Frank Collison]]) is Tommy's grandfather and Beverly Goodman's father, referred to by everyone as \"Grandpa Goodman\" (despite the fact that he is really Beverly's father, while he and Stanley are in-laws), while . He is the only family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil ways and has borne witness to the dog's several murders and other depraved acts. However, most of his family and the town Sheriff dismiss his attempts to expose the dog as just another of one of his \"''evil Mr. Pickles stories''\" and sometimes the Sheriff arrests him instead. Henry views Mr. Pickles as a monster though he understands that he and Mr. Pickles both care for Tommy's safety. Henry also suffers harassment from Mr. Pickles, though he briefly got peace from the dog during his brief fear of vacuum cleaners.\n\nAt the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2, Henry attempts to expose Mr. Pickles by video-taping the inside of Mr. Pickles' doghouse to show to the Sheriff before learning he was one of Mr. Pickles' many high-tech androids. Henry ends being committed to the Old Town asylum when he attacked the real sheriff, realizing Mr. Pickles can't touch him while learning too late that asylum's director wishes to lobotomize him. Mr. Pickles eventually manages to free Henry from the asylum, ironically saving him.\n\nIn the Season 2 finale and Season 3, Henry's attempt to find out about a strange coin associated with Mr. Pickles led to him learning that his wife Agnes, who is revealed to be Steve, is still alive and serves by Mr. Pickles' side. Henry threatens to expose them, but Mr. Pickles arranges Agnes to found while feigning amnesia, Henry takes her to a memory download service in an attempt to forcefully recover her memories before it backfired when the proprietor is revealed to be a blackmailing hacker. Following Agnes's death when she was run over by a truck after learning she lied naked with his son-in-law, Henry angrily tries to confront Mr. Pickles before finding her revived and made some peace with Agnes as she sacrifices herself to destroy the satellite containing the hacker's memory backups.\n\nIn the Season 3 finale and Season 4, Henry grows tired of Mr. Pickles' continued torment and moves out of Old Town to a mountainside cabin while promising to visit the Goodman Family. Henry expected Mr. Pickles would come after him and lays a trap for him so he can kill the dog. But Mr. Pickles tricks Henry into believing he can speak while revising his original plan of further discrediting the old man to instead frame him as a mass murderer, with Henry on the lam with Sheriff following him to Mexico. Henry takes Sheriff's gun and forces him to take him to Mr. Pickles's ancestral island home, gaining an accomplice in one of Mr. Pickles's followers as they scheme to snipe the dog. Though it seemed Mr. Pickles was step away and killed him while setting up another to take the mass murder charges, Henry swapped souls with his accomplice prior to escape his death and then transferred his soul into a show dog Mr. Pickles was making out with to kill him. But Henry's victory is short-lived when Miss Pickles is born.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', Henry is shown to be annoyed by Mrs. Pickles' antics.\n\n===Sheriff===\n'''[[Sheriff]]''' (voiced by Will Carsola) is the unnamed sheriff of Old Town. He lives with his mother and sister. He behaves like a young boy and has a doll named Abbigail, whom he often talks to and has tea parties with. He is often called upon by Henry whenever he has evidence of Mr. Pickles being evil, but Mr. Pickles usually manages to place the blame on somebody else or remove the evidence causing the Sheriff to remain skeptical to the old man's claims. Ironically, despite his dubious abilities as a police officer, the Sheriff is often credited with the capture and arrest of individuals Mr. Pickles sets up to take the fall, contributing to the town's view that the Sheriff is a competent law enforcement official. The Sheriff himself seems to view Mr. Pickles as a good-natured dog and in season 2 even recruits Mr. Pickles as a police dog to help him track down some escaped serial killers. Mr. Pickles even saves the Sheriff from being killed by one of the escaped killers. This makes him one of the few people outside the Goodman family that actually ends up being protected by Mr. Pickles' evil actions. Because of his childlike personality, Mr. Pickles finds it easy to manipulate him, even dressing himself in human skin in Season 3 so he can engage in his daily sexual debauchery and murderous activities, then dressing a pimp in said skin suit and have him be killed by the Sheriff in order to take the fall for Mr. Pickles' activities while at the same time giving the Sheriff the perfect birthday present for his mother, her son being hailed as a hero in the paper for apparently stopping a dangerous serial killer.\n\nAfter Henry finally succeeds in killing Mr Pickles in the Season 4 premiere, Sheriff gets a spin-off called \"Momma Named Me Sheriff\" where Stanley is now working for him as a deputy.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Steve===\n'''Steve''' (voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]]) is Henry's wife and Beverly's mother who was originally known as '''Agnes Gobbleblobber'''. As revealed by Beverly, who bore some resentment towards her mother for cutting down her dreams of taking a career in fencing to be a housewife, Agnes was once a critical homebody. For reasons yet to be fully revealed, Agnes faked her death and became Mr. Pickles' [[Bondage suit|gimp]] Steve. Steve lives in the caves under Mr. Pickles' doghouse as its guardian and right hand while often taking part in Mr. Pickles' depraved activities. In the Season 2 finale and Season 3 premiere, assuming she was revived by Mr. Pickles, Henry learns about Steve's true identity as she resumed her original identity while feigning memory loss with the intention to make Henry's life more miserable. But a series of events involving her memories being downloaded exposed her having lied naked with her son-in-law. This provokes Agnes into a rant, revealing that Stanley refused to have sex with her and overstep her boundaries when she insulted Tommy while nearly exposing herself. Agnes realizes too late that she offended Mr. Pickles and she ended up being run over and killed by a truck while pleading for the dog's forgiveness. After being revived by Mr. Pickles, Agnes makes some peace with Henry while making her goodbyes to him and Mr. Pickles before sacrificing herself to destroy the satellite containing her downloaded memories. Before the satellite is destroyed, it is implied from one of her past memories that Agnes became Steve when Mr. Pickles held a knife to her throat and she pleaded for her life.\n\n===Floyd===\n'''Floyd''' (voiced by Dave Stewart) is colleague of Stanley Goodman who works as a telemarketer. Morbidly obese to the point that his excessive fat sags, Floyd is almost always seen eating various foods. He got his obesity from traveling to food competitions, which he won. Because of his competition fame, he is surprisingly quite wealthy and lives in a mansion with his beautiful wife. His mansion's interior designs are made mostly out of food. He also has a gym, but doesn't use it since he can't fit through the door. Despite his appetite and appearance, he seems to get along with others, although Stanley finds him awkward to be around. In the second episode of the second season, Floyd has apparently become more obese.\n\n===Mr. Bojenkins===\n'''Mr. Bojenkins''' (voiced by Frank Collison in 2014\u20132016, [[Alex D\u00e9sert]] in 2018) is a kindly African-American man that drives a wagon pulled by some large pit bulls. He's known to have sex with multiple women and is considered the Sheriff's best friend. Like the other adults, he makes fun of Grandpa's evil Mr. Pickles stories. In a season 2 episode, Mr. Bojenkins took it upon himself to save the Sheriff from a woman who was the daughter of a crime boss who was held captive by Mr. Pickles since Season 1. After rescuing the Sheriff with the aid of the Sheriff's elderly mother, he ended up sleeping with her. In Season 3, he attempts to teach the Sheriff how to be a man after noticing he is a momma's boy. He takes the Sheriff to a bar and treats him to a drink, but the Sheriff gets really drunk causing havoc in the bar. To make matters worse, Tommy finds Mr. Bojenkins' cellphone which contains the numbers of various women he has been sleeping with, revealing his womanizing ways. They confront him at the bar, revealing that he slept with the Sheriff's mother to the Sheriff who attacks him in a drunken rage. They fall into a river and are washed up to a forest ruled by ravenous wolves. The two argue but are attacked by the wolves, though the Sheriff is able to pacify them briefly with his doll Abigail, before they are dragged away. They meet the leading female of the pack who the Sheriff pacifies, though it works too well causing her to become attracted to the Sheriff who Mr. Bojenkins convinces to have sex with to save their lives, though they are forced to flee when the leading male returns. Mr. Bojenkins reconciles with the Sheriff after their adventure.\n\n===Linda===\n'''Linda''' (voiced by Dave Stewart), also known as \"Crazy Linda\", is an unattractive and deranged woman who is Beverly's best friend. She is known for trying to sell people, especially the Goodmans, products that are either old or broken. She was once married to Henry but that was because he was drunk, thanks to Mr. Pickles. She is often seen digging in trash to search for something to sell to people. She also has a daughter named Linda Jr. It is revealed that she's actually very wealthy and lives inside a fancy house that looks like a tree, but would often give some of her money away to the homeless.\n\n====Linda Jr.====\n'''Linda Jr.''' is the daughter of Crazy Linda. She looks similar to her mother but is cleaner. She has a thumb growing out of her navel but doesn't let it bother her. She's sweet, kind and helps Tommy learn to be himself and how being different shouldn't let him stop him from doing anything he wants to do. Linda indicates that she doesn't know the identity of her father.\n\n===Boss===\n'''Boss''' (voiced by Will Carsola) is Stanley's young, acne-ridden boss with a shrill, pubescent voice who uses his position to bully Stanley to do undesirable and humiliating things.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', Stanley quit prior to the spin-off. In one episode, his real name is revealed to be \"Boss\" and that he has been selling some dangerous items.\n\n===Bullies===\nThe '''Bullies''' are two boys that make fun and tease Tommy for his condition while getting into suggestive poses that imply a homosexual attraction between them. In Season 3, it is revealed they are the Blojrton Boys and Beverly attempts to speak to their parents after they beat up Tommy. However, their white trash parents encourage their behavior as they hate their kids and end up pawning them off to Beverly who is forced to deal with their misbehavior. Mr. Pickles almost kills them when they attack Tommy with vibrators, but Beverly interrupts his attempt to murder them to protect Tommy. Eventually, the bullies are kidnapped by a Motorcycle gang that ride [[Segway]]s to punish them for their misbehavior, though Beverly rescues them on a motorcycle she built out of household junk and they become afraid of her after she single-handedly defeats the entire gang. Their parents try to ditch their children again but the Sheriff causes Beverly to run over them and their boys. Mr. Pickles decides to take revenge by painting the parents' full body casts and hanging them like pi\u00f1atas for the motorcycle gang member who is celebrating his birthday.\n\n===Blade===\n'''Blade''' is a handicapped computer hacker who Mr. Bojenkins seeks the aid of in Season 2 to help save the Sheriff from his new girlfriend who is actually the daughter of a crime boss. He loves raw bass and tends to offer it to anyone who visits him resulting in his catchphrase \"''Fish?''\", though his grandmother hates that her house is full of stinking fish. In Season 3, Tommy seeks his help when a group of hackers running a memory upload service blackmail the town and seeks his help in stopping them, which results in the memories being downloaded into Tommy's brain, forcing Mr. Pickles to kill the hacker's leader and revive him to save Tommy and prevent Steve's memories from being revealed.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===Mayor of Old Town===\nThe '''Mayor of Old Town''' (voiced by [[John Ennis (actor)|John Ennis]]) appears in the season 2 episode ''Mental Asylum''. Mr. Pickles accidentally kills the Mayor when he is with a prostitute, during one of Mr. Pickles' senseless acts of murder. Mr. Pickles later poses as the Mayor by using the Mayor's skin as a suit in order to free Grandpa Goodman from the asylum. Mr. Pickles makes the Mayor appear crazy at a town hall meeting by humping a female dog, allowing himself to be committed, which allows Mr. Pickles to get inside in order to free Grandpa.\n\n====Mayor's Wife====\n'''The Mayor's Wife''' (voiced by [[Kaitlyn Robrock]]) is a pompous woman who likes to flaunt her husband's status in front of others like Beverly Goodman, (saying \"My husband, the Mayor.\") She is unaware of her husband's unfaithfulness and was unable to tell Mr. Pickles was posing as her husband. She is horrified and publicly disgraced when the Mayor \u2013 actually Mr. Pickles \u2013 humps her pet dog during a town meeting.\n\n===Warden===\nThe '''[[Prison warden|Warden]]''' runs the mental asylum Grandpa is wrongfully taken to. He is known to laugh maniacally in between sentences and deeply desires to lobotomize his patients. He issues a proposal to the Mayor to make lobotomies legal. Mr. Pickles, posing as the Mayor, approves his proposal before he is caught having sex with a dog and is promptly sent to the asylum. The Warden then prepares him for a lobotomy, but Mr. Pickles bursts from his body at the last minute and kidnaps the Warden. The Warden is then taken to Mr. Pickles' lair where he is given a lobotomy by one of the asylum patients (now mutated into a frog after identifying as one). The Warden is seen in the next episode living as a prisoner in Mr. Pickles' lair alive, but clearly different from his lobotomy.\n\n===Ron Bolton===\n'''Ron Bolton''' is a successful [[lawyer]] Grandpa hires in ''Grandpa's Night Out'' to help him claim infidelity to divorce Linda by hiring several undercover seducers, all of which Mr. Pickles disposes of by either killing or imprisoning them. As a last resort, Ron hires a hitman to kill Linda. Mr. Pickles kills the hitman and frames Ron for the murders of the hitman and the seducers.\n\n===Baby Man===\n'''Baby Man''' is an adult baby who appears in the first episode when Grandpa is taken to one of Mr. Pickles' fetish parties where the dog proceeds to kill and dismember the party-goers (excluding the Baby Man). Mr. Pickles later fuses him with the body parts of the other fetishists (both dead and alive). Despite this, the Baby Man's playful attitude still remains, although is often be found aggressively demanding milk, and appears from time to time in Mr. Pickles' lair.\n\n===Frog Man===\n'''Frog Man''' is a former patient at Old Town Mental Asylum. He is first seen admitting himself into the asylum, claiming that he thinks he's a tomato. When he's in the asylum, he sees an episode of ''Astronaut Dolphin Detective'' and then identifies himself as a frog. Mr. Pickles later kidnaps him after threatening the Warden to release Grandpa. Using various dead body parts, Mr. Pickles sews the man into a giant froglike body with little drills for fingers. The Frog Man is then used to perform a lobotomy on the Warden.\n\n===Doc Walton===\n'''Doc Walton''' is a cross-eyed plastic surgeon who offers numerous cosmetic procedures (advertised as \"jobs\") from within his horse-driven wagon. Tommy confuses his \"jobs\" as employment and is given a breast enlargement as a result. Doc Walton is later kidnapped by Mr. Pickles and taken to his lair where he is given a set of six large breasts. He is seen in the background of the second season inside Mr. Pickles' lair.\n\n===Bigfoot===\n'''[[Bigfoot]]''' (voiced by Sean Conroy) is a former criminal named Vito Pizzarelli who was one of the mob's most feared [[Contract killing|hitmen]] before he was caught by the police. They forced Vito to rat out the entire Gabagoolie criminal organization and he was then placed under different surgeries to portray the eponymous legendary figure by the witness protection program. Tommy and Mr. Pickles encounter Bigfoot in the woods and he agrees to help bake a new Father's Day pie after he ate the previous one. Mr. Pickles also helps Bigfoot by killing the Gabagoolie who wished to exact their revenge when they discovered his identity after he was caught in the grocery store picking up ingredients. Bigfoot reappears in season two, now married to a doe (dubbed his \"dear wife\") who gave birth to his son, Dear Boy, a deer-human hybrid. Bigfoot gets Tommy to look after his son while he spends some alone time with his wife. Unfortunately, his wife is killed by some hunters. Bigfoot claims that in his past he would have sought revenge, but his fatherhood has now changed him. Bigfoot mourns the loss of his wife at a campfire where he is confronted by the hunter who killed his wife. Mr. Pickles saves him by killing the hunter, and Bigfoot then asks him to look after his Dear Boy again while he spends time with his new lover, an owl.\n\n===The Cannibal===\n'''The Cannibal''' is a convicted serial killer and cannibal who is the main antagonist in the episode ''Serial Killers''. He is considered too strange for \"normal\" serial killers and is prone to making cannibal-themed puns while licking his lips. He escaped police custody when he broke out of his cuffs inside the police car before eating Rape-and-Kill Ronny. The bus then crashed and released the remaining criminals during the road collision in the series opening. The Cannibal befriends Grandpa with the intent of feeding on him and soon gets invited to have dinner with his family. The Sheriff mistakes the Cannibal for a gum thief when he misconstrues his puns and joins the dinner in preparation to arrest him while the Cannibal plans to kill everyone. However, Mr. Pickles replaces his shiv with a stolen packet of gum and the Cannibal is then arrested for stealing gum alongside the actual gum thief who was mistaken for the cannibal. The Cannibal once again escapes custody, but is ritually killed by Mr. Pickles who removes his heart before playing with it.\n\n===Superhero Guy===\n'''Superhero Guy''' (voiced by Will Carsola) is an ex-superhero whose superhero career was destroyed when his true identity (Phil Robertson) was revealed by a baby pulling his mask off after he rescued a bunch of babies from a burning nursery that Crime Man blew up. This resulted in people calling him to do mundane tasks which led him to become addicted to sh\u00f6venpucker: the act of shoving super sour candy balls up his anus to get high. When the candy was banned, Superhero Guy started buying them from back-alley dealers and stealing steel to sell after he became bankrupt to feed his addiction. After Superhero Guy stole Tommy's leg braces, Tommy and Sidekick Boy attempt to help him by luring the now-elderly Superhero Guy into a rehab center using a piece of steel. Superhero Guy then stole the key to his secret base in hopes of selling the steel robot suit, but ended up using the suit to steal cars and a bridge to sell as metal. When Superhero Guy goes to the recycling plant, Mr. Pickles forces him into a large compacter but refrains from killing him when he notices Tommy's braces are inside, too. Superhero Guy then escapes, but ends up having his body fused into Crime Man's vehicle that Mr. Pickles rides in the night.\n\n====Sidekick Boy====\n''''Sidekick Boy''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is the sidekick of Superhero Guy. When Superhero Guy became addicted to sh\u00f6venpucker after his identity was exposed, Sidekick Guy had to change the locks on their lair. Tommy later enlisted Sidekick Boy in an attempt to get him into a rehab. After Mr. Pickles fuses Superhero Guy to Crime Man's car and drives off into the night, Sidekick Boy advises Tommy not to reveal his secret identity if he ever becomes a superhero.\n\n===Crime Man===\n'''Crime Man''' (voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]) is a supervillain that terrorizes Old Town. He was responsible for blowing up the nursery which led to events that led to Superhero Guy accidentally getting unmasked.\n\nIn the present, Crime Man is still causing trouble. He is later killed by Mr. Pickles and his car is fused to Superhero Guy.\n\n===Dear Boy===\n'''Dear Boy''' is Bigfoot's son who resembles a talking deer with a human-like head, hands, and feet. Dear Boy is put under Tommy's protection when he wants to prove that he can be responsible, but Dear Boy's uncontrollable nature causes them to have a run-in with a couple of hunters. Dear Boy then has his foot caught in a bear trap and begs Tommy to euthanize him with a gun. However, his father soon rescues him just after his mother is killed. Due to him being part-human, Dear Boy is immune to Mr. Pickles' mind-controlling powers.\n\n===Jon Gabagooli===\n'''Jon Gabagooli''' (voiced by [[Frank Vincent]]) is the boss of the Gabagooli criminal family. He attempted to kill Vito Pizzarelli (now \"Bigfoot\") when he was sighted at a grocery store. After Mr. Pickles killed the other Gabagoolies, Jon was imprisoned in Mr. Pickles' lair and was made to help break into the grocery store to steal jumbo pickles. Jon managed to escape in season two, but was arrested by the Sheriff when he was caught trying to steal a car. Jon's daughter, Lisa Gabagoolie, frees him from jail by seducing the Sheriff and stealing his keys. Under the false belief that the Sheriff had sex with her, Jon attempts to kill him until Mr. Bojenkins and the sheriff's mother come to the rescue. Jon and his daughter escape the town in a car where they're confronted by what appears to be Mr. Pickles. Jon runs him over out of revenge, but discovers that it was actually a cardboard cut-out before the real Mr. Pickles rips his face off and shoots him in the mouth. As for Lisa, she flees with Mr. Pickles pursuing her, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n===Vegan Leader===\n'''Vegan Leader''' (voiced by [[Rob Zombie]]) is the leader of a quasi-religious group of vegans. He resembles a priest with a large beard that is constantly stroked by a pair of beautiful women. His body is covered in tattoos of vegan slogans and vegetables, and his genitals have been completely removed. Beverly is invited to his headquarters and greatly upsets him with her misunderstanding of veganism (she believes one can both eat animal products and be vegan at the same time). He attempts to convert her to veganism by showing her a fake slaughterhouse video and locking her in a cage like an animal. Fearing that Beverly's influence will corrupt the other vegans, he decides to perform an ancient vegan ceremony from \"hundreds and hundreds of months ago\". He tied Beverly to a large V while blindfolded so that they can beat the 'ignorance' out of her with hammers. Beverly is saved when a non-vegan pizza she delivered earlier arrives which causes the other vegans to give in. Mr. Pickles then arrives and kills the other vegans before they can taste the pizza and then kills the leader by impaling his skull with a giant carrot.\n\n===The Midget===\nThe Midget criminal suffering from dwarfism who pretends to be a child that Tommy befriends in Season 2. He dislikes being called a midget and often corrects people by telling them that the correct term is \"Little Person\". Though he ends up tricking Tommy into robbing a bank, he himself is later betrayed by his girlfriend and caught by the Sheriff. He has an antagonistic relationship with the Sheriff and harasses him on the Sheriff's mother's birthday in Season 3.\n\n===Principal Garcia===\n'''Principal Garcia''' is the principal of Old Town Elementary School, he is massively muscled, heavily-tattooed, and maintains a strict \"no dogs\" rule at the school, at first earning Mr. Pickles' ire. However, when spying on him intent on revenge, he learns Garcia was an ex-gang member, and is now earnestly focused on providing a good education and bright future to all his students, making Mr. Pickles decide to save him when his members of his former gang arrive to blackmail Garcia.\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television adult animation|Mr. Pickles]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2014|*, Mr. Pickles]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Mr. Pickles'' characters}}\n{{unreferenced|date=September 2017}}\nThe following is a list of characters from the series ''[[Mr. Pickles]]'' and its spin-off ''[[Momma Named Me Sheriff]]''.\n\n==Main characters==\n===Mr. Pickles===\n'''Mr. Pickles''' (voiced by Dave Stewart in the Season 3 Finale) is the titular [[protagonist]] and the Goodman family's pet [[Border Collie]], revealed the Season four to be descended from a bloodline of dogs that are physical [[Incarnation|embodiment]] of the [[Devil]] that ruled over an island nation that previously sacrificed dogs. Through reasons unknown, Mr. Pickles ended up in Old Town and living with the Goodman family - named by Tommy for his love of eating [[pickled cucumber|pickles]]. He also enjoys mutilating, killing and engaging in sexual debauchery with those who pose a threat to Tommy or other protagonists. Mr. Pickles is highly intelligent and possesses incredible strength, surgical skills that he uses to mutilate his victims, the ability to steal from an evil scientist, a high-tech [[Android (robot)|android]], and demonic powers which allow him to control local animals to do his bidding (it is shown in one episode of Season 3 that he can't control snakes due to them having no ears to hear his demonic commands but learns to control them through vibrations). Despite his evil ways, he loves and is extremely protective of the impressionable young Tommy and his family: protecting them from danger, and often killing those who might do them harm, such as murdering a group of [[pedophilia|pedophile]]s or turning an unlicensed [[breast surgery|breast surgeon]] who gave Tommy [[breast implant]]s into a multiple-breasted freak. He has a long-standing feud with Henry Gobbleblobber, the only Goodman family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. While Mr. Pickles does not actually harm Henry, the dog does put the old man in humiliating situations while making him seem crazy to everyone else. Despite their adversarial nature, Mr. Pickles has saved Henry from being lobotomized while he was committed to an asylum and a cannibalistic serial killer that Henry had befriended, unaware he was an escaped convict and serial killer. Mr. Pickles has also shown to be sexually attracted to Tommy's mother by often groping, touching her private areas, and even playfully dry-humping her.\n\nMr. Pickles' doghouse leads to a hidden, underground lair that's filled with blood, pentagrams, victims \u2013 both living slaves and dead, mutilated bodies \u2013 and a throne where he usually eats his pickles. Many of the series' one-time characters usually end up in his lair where they are either killed or kept as prisoners. Henry is the only person shown to be able to enter Mr. Pickles' lair and survive repeatedly as nobody believes him due to his tales. He is responsible for turning Henry's wife Agnes into Steve, which is implied to have been due to her promising to do anything he wanted her to. Mr. Pickles and Agnes work together to stop Henry from revealing the truth by having Agnes pretend she has amnesia, but their plan hits a snag when Henry takes her to a memory download service which is actually a blackmailing scam run by a group of hackers. Agnes angers Mr. Pickles when she almost blows everything while being confronted by her daughter and Henry over her failed attempt to seduce Stanley into having an affair which had been revealed by Tommy. She is killed by a passing truck but Mr. Pickles revives her and sends her on one last mission to destroy the satellite which contains a backup file of her memories. Though it is implied that Agnes became Steve because Mr. Pickles threatened to kill her, Mr. Pickles sheds a tear as he shoots Steve into space, indicating that he did come to care for her.\n\nHe also works well with Beverly when Stanley and his coworkers are kidnapped and ends up saving her, Stanley, and his coworkers from their captors showing that he is just as protective of Tommy's parents. In the Season 3 Finale, Mr. Pickles chases Henry down to his cabin after he moves away, intending to lessen his credibility further by making it seem he can talk via a speaker for one of his spare Steves to speak through. But Mr. Pickles decides to frame Henry for mass murder instead after the old man attempted to kill him, with Henry escaping the Sheriff and finding Mr. Pickles's ancestral home where he and one of Mr. Pickles's servant conduct a scheme to kill him. Though Mr. Pickles appeared to outwit and seemingly killed Henry by switching bodies with the owner of a show dog he was making love with, he ends up being killed for real as Henry used the same spell to switch bodies with Mr. Pickles's servant and then the show dog. However, the show dog gives birth to a female puppy that Tommy names \"Mrs. Pickles\".\n\n===Tommy Goodman===\n'''Tommy Goodman''' (voiced by [[Kaitlyn Robrock]]) is the Goodman family's physically disabled young son. He is 6-year-old, wears [[Orthotics|leg-braces]] and considers Mr. Pickles as his best friend, often feeding him pickles whenever he behaves. Tommy is often protected by Mr. Pickles and is protective of Mr. Pickles as well, such as when he took it upon himself to search for Mr. Pickles after he was kidnapped by mercenaries. Due to his na\u00efve personality, Tommy usually gets involved in dangerous situations and Mr. Pickles (at times frustrated) steps in to save him and dispose of the bad people involved. Like most characters on the show, Tommy is unaware of Mr. Pickles' evil nature. At one point in season two, Mr. Pickles spends most of the episode away from Tommy; this results in Tommy getting involved in a series of accidents, causing him to scorn Mr. Pickles and not give him a pickle. However, in Season 3's opening, he returns to his friendly nature after finding his grandmother Agnes. Agnes, however, shows contempt for Tommy, calling him a stupid boy even while pretending to be amnesiac.\n\n===Stanley Goodman===\n'''Stanley Goodman''' (voiced by [[Jay Johnston]]) is Tommy's father who works as a [[Telemarketing|telemarketer]]. Stanley is constantly bullied by his boss; as a result, Stanley hardly has time to spend with his family, especially his son. Nevertheless, Stanley means well and is committed to his family. Though they don't interact much, Mr. Pickles seems to respect him to a degree. He even showed displeasure when it looked as though a doctor was about to bring Stanley harm. In the opening of Season 3, it is revealed that he once laid naked with his mother-in-law Agnes, which is revealed by Tommy when he had all the town's memories uploaded into his mind. However, Agnes reveals that he refused to have sex with her when she tried to seduce him.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', he quits his job as a telemarketer and became deputy where he works under the Sheriff.\n\n===Beverly Goodman===\n'''Beverly Goodman''' (voiced by [[Brooke Shields]]) is Tommy's stay-at-home mother who is the traditional dutiful mother and wife. Beverly is oblivious of Mr. Pickles' evil nature and dismisses the dog's sexual behavior, for instance groping and touching her, as simple dog mannerisms. Like her son, Beverly is very na\u00efve and sometimes feels limited by her home life. Despite being the first person to dismiss her father's stories about Mr. Pickles, she is very close to him as he is one of the few people she can talk to. Near the end of the second season, she's shown to be very tired of her domestic duties and had a strained relationship with her mother, who prevented Beverley from following her dreams. In Season 3, she returns to her normal self after Agnes is found by Tommy unaware it was to prevent her father from revealing that Agnes was Steven. She hopes to reconnect with her mother despite believing she has amnesia. When it is revealed that Agnes had lied naked next to her husband, she is angered at Stanley and her mother, though Agnes reveals in anger that Stanley refused her attempts to seduce him before she is killed by a passing truck. However Agnes' death seems to give her some closure thanks to the knowledge that Stanley chose to remain faithful to her and their marriage. She and Stanley decide to tell Tommy that his grandmother is in a better place as he is unaware of her death. In Season 3 she is shown to be more assertive and capable, even working together with Mr. Pickles to rescue her husband when he is kidnapped together with his coworkers by an insane telemarketer-hating plantation owner. She is also capable of constructing a motorcycle from household items and even fight off a motorcycle gang all by herself. However, she has a habit of damaging her husband's trunk every time she drives even when she does not drive the truck itself, as she ends up damaging it with her makeshift motorcycle after it is hit by a bowling ball thrown by the Sheriff. However, she retains her kind-hearted personality when she refuses to punish Tommy's bullies physically as she doesn't condone corporal punishment or violence against children.\n\n===Henry Gobbleblobber===\n'''Henry Gobbleblobber''' (voiced by [[Frank Collison]]) is Tommy's grandfather and Beverly Goodman's father, referred to by everyone as \"Grandpa Goodman\" (despite the fact that he is really Beverly's father, while he and Stanley are in-laws), while . He is the only family member aware of Mr. Pickles' evil ways and has borne witness to the dog's several murders and other depraved acts. However, most of his family and the town Sheriff dismiss his attempts to expose the dog as just another of one of his \"''evil Mr. Pickles stories''\" and sometimes the Sheriff arrests him instead. Henry views Mr. Pickles as a monster though he understands that he and Mr. Pickles both care for Tommy's safety. Henry also suffers harassment from Mr. Pickles, though he briefly got peace from the dog during his brief fear of vacuum cleaners.\n\nAt the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2, Henry attempts to expose Mr. Pickles by video-taping the inside of Mr. Pickles' doghouse to show to the Sheriff before learning he was one of Mr. Pickles' many high-tech androids. Henry ends being committed to the Old Town asylum when he attacked the real sheriff, realizing Mr. Pickles can't touch him while learning too late that asylum's director wishes to lobotomize him. Mr. Pickles eventually manages to free Henry from the asylum, ironically saving him.\n\nIn the Season 2 finale and Season 3, Henry's attempt to find out about a strange coin associated with Mr. Pickles led to him learning that his wife Agnes, who is revealed to be Steve, is still alive and serves by Mr. Pickles' side. Henry threatens to expose them, but Mr. Pickles arranges Agnes to found while feigning amnesia, Henry takes her to a memory download service in an attempt to forcefully recover her memories before it backfired when the proprietor is revealed to be a blackmailing hacker. Following Agnes's death when she was run over by a truck after learning she lied naked with his son-in-law, Henry angrily tries to confront Mr. Pickles before finding her revived and made some peace with Agnes as she sacrifices herself to destroy the satellite containing the hacker's memory backups.\n\nIn the Season 3 finale and Season 4, Henry grows tired of Mr. Pickles' continued torment and moves out of Old Town to a mountainside cabin while promising to visit the Goodman Family. Henry expected Mr. Pickles would come after him and lays a trap for him so he can kill the dog. But Mr. Pickles tricks Henry into believing he can speak while revising his original plan of further discrediting the old man to instead frame him as a mass murderer, with Henry on the lam with Sheriff following him to Mexico. Henry takes Sheriff's gun and forces him to take him to Mr. Pickles's ancestral island home, gaining an accomplice in one of Mr. Pickles's followers as they scheme to snipe the dog. Though it seemed Mr. Pickles was step away and killed him while setting up another to take the mass murder charges, Henry swapped souls with his accomplice prior to escape his death and then transferred his soul into a show dog Mr. Pickles was making out with to kill him. But Henry's victory is short-lived when Miss Pickles is born.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', Henry is shown to be annoyed by Mrs. Pickles' antics.\n\n===Sheriff===\n'''[[Sheriff]]''' (voiced by Will Carsola) is the unnamed sheriff of Old Town. He lives with his mother and sister. He behaves like a young boy and has a doll named Abbigail, whom he often talks to and has tea parties with. He is often called upon by Henry whenever he has evidence of Mr. Pickles being evil, but Mr. Pickles usually manages to place the blame on somebody else or remove the evidence causing the Sheriff to remain skeptical to the old man's claims. Ironically, despite his dubious abilities as a police officer, the Sheriff is often credited with the capture and arrest of individuals Mr. Pickles sets up to take the fall, contributing to the town's view that the Sheriff is a competent law enforcement official. The Sheriff himself seems to view Mr. Pickles as a good-natured dog and in season 2 even recruits Mr. Pickles as a police dog to help him track down some escaped serial killers. Mr. Pickles even saves the Sheriff from being killed by one of the escaped killers. This makes him one of the few people outside the Goodman family that actually ends up being protected by Mr. Pickles' evil actions. Because of his childlike personality, Mr. Pickles finds it easy to manipulate him, even dressing himself in human skin in Season 3 so he can engage in his daily sexual debauchery and murderous activities, then dressing a pimp in said skin suit and have him be killed by the Sheriff in order to take the fall for Mr. Pickles' activities while at the same time giving the Sheriff the perfect birthday present for his mother, her son being hailed as a hero in the paper for apparently stopping a dangerous serial killer.\n\nAfter Henry finally succeeds in killing Mr Pickles in the Season 4 premiere, Sheriff gets a spin-off called \"Momma Named Me Sheriff\" where Stanley is now working for him as a deputy.\n\n==Recurring characters==\n\n===Steve===\n'''Steve''' (voiced by [[Barbara Goodson]]) is Henry's wife and Beverly's mother who was originally known as '''Agnes Gobbleblobber'''. As revealed by Beverly, who bore some resentment towards her mother for cutting down her dreams of taking a career in fencing to be a housewife, Agnes was once a critical homebody. For reasons yet to be fully revealed, Agnes faked her death and became Mr. Pickles' [[Bondage suit|gimp]] Steve. Steve lives in the caves under Mr. Pickles' doghouse as its guardian and right hand while often taking part in Mr. Pickles' depraved activities. In the Season 2 finale and Season 3 premiere, assuming she was revived by Mr. Pickles, Henry learns about Steve's true identity as she resumed her original identity while feigning memory loss with the intention to make Henry's life more miserable. But a series of events involving her memories being downloaded exposed her having lied naked with her son-in-law. This provokes Agnes into a rant, revealing that Stanley refused to have sex with her and overstep her boundaries when she insulted Tommy while nearly exposing herself. Agnes realizes too late that she offended Mr. Pickles and she ended up being run over and killed by a truck while pleading for the dog's forgiveness. After being revived by Mr. Pickles, Agnes makes some peace with Henry while making her goodbyes to him and Mr. Pickles before sacrificing herself to destroy the satellite containing her downloaded memories. Before the satellite is destroyed, it is implied from one of her past memories that Agnes became Steve when Mr. Pickles held a knife to her throat and she pleaded for her life.\n\n===Floyd===\n'''Floyd''' (voiced by Dave Stewart) is colleague of Stanley Goodman who works as a telemarketer. Morbidly obese to the point that his excessive fat sags, Floyd is almost always seen eating various foods. He got his obesity from traveling to food competitions, which he won. Because of his competition fame, he is surprisingly quite wealthy and lives in a mansion with his beautiful wife. His mansion's interior designs are made mostly out of food. He also has a gym, but doesn't use it since he can't fit through the door. Despite his appetite and appearance, he seems to get along with others, although Stanley finds him awkward to be around. In the second episode of the second season, Floyd has apparently become more obese.\n\n===Mr. Bojenkins===\n'''Mr. Bojenkins''' (voiced by Frank Collison in 2014-2016, [[Alex D\u00e9sert]] in 2018) is a kindly African-American man that drives a wagon pulled by some large pit bulls. He's known to have sex with multiple women and is considered the Sheriff's best friend. Like the other adults, he makes fun of Grandpa's evil Mr. Pickles stories. In a season 2 episode, Mr. Bojenkins took it upon himself to save the Sheriff from a woman who was the daughter of a crime boss who was held captive by Mr. Pickles since Season 1. After rescuing the Sheriff with the aid of the Sheriff's elderly mother, he ended up sleeping with her. In Season 3, he attempts to teach the Sheriff how to be a man after noticing he is a momma's boy. He takes the Sheriff to a bar and treats him to a drink, but the Sheriff gets really drunk causing havoc in the bar. To make matters worse, Tommy finds Mr. Bojenkins' cellphone which contains the numbers of various women he has been sleeping with, revealing his womanizing ways. They confront him at the bar, revealing that he slept with the Sheriff's mother to the Sheriff who attacks him in a drunken rage. They fall into a river and are washed up to a forest ruled by ravenous wolves. The two argue but are attacked by the wolves, though the Sheriff is able to pacify them briefly with his doll Abigail, before they are dragged away. They meet the leading female of the pack who the Sheriff pacifies, though it works too well causing her to become attracted to the Sheriff who Mr. Bojenkins convinces to have sex with to save their lives, though they are forced to flee when the leading male returns. Mr. Bojenkins reconciles with the Sheriff after their adventure.\n\n===Linda===\n'''Linda''' (voiced by Dave Stewart), also known as \"Crazy Linda\", is an unattractive and deranged woman who is Beverly's best friend. She is known for trying to sell people, especially the Goodmans, products that are either old or broken. She was once married to Henry but that was because he was drunk, thanks to Mr. Pickles. She is often seen digging in trash to search for something to sell to people. She also has a daughter named Linda Jr. It is revealed that she\u2019s actually very wealthy and lives inside a fancy house that looks like a tree, but would often give some of her money away to the homeless.\n\n====Linda Jr.====\n'''Linda Jr.''' is the daughter of Crazy Linda. She looks similar to her mother but is cleaner. She has a thumb growing out of her navel but doesn't let it bother her. She's sweet, kind and helps Tommy learn to be himself and how being different shouldn't let him stop him from doing anything he wants to do. Linda indicates that she doesn't know the identity of her father.\n\n===Boss===\n'''Boss''' (voiced by Will Carsola) is Stanley's young, acne-ridden boss with a shrill, pubescent voice who uses his position to bully Stanley to do undesirable and humiliating things.\n\nIn ''Momma Named Me Sheriff'', Stanley quit prior to the spin-off. In one episode, his real name is revealed to be \"Boss\" and that he has been selling some dangerous items.\n\n===Bullies===\nThe '''Bullies''' are two boys that make fun and tease Tommy for his condition while getting into suggestive poses that imply a homosexual attraction between them. In Season 3, it is revealed they are the Blojrton Boys and Beverly attempts to speak to their parents after they beat up Tommy. However, their white trash parents encourage their behavior as they hate their kids and end up pawning them off to Beverly who is forced to deal with their misbehavior. Mr. Pickles almost kills them when they attack Tommy with vibrators, but Beverly interrupts his attempt to murder them to protect Tommy. Eventually, the bullies are kidnapped by a Motorcycle gang that ride [[Segway]]s to punish them for their misbehavior, though Beverly rescues them on a motorcycle she built out of household junk and they become afraid of her after she single-handedly defeats the entire gang. Their parents try to ditch their children again but the Sheriff causes Beverly to run over them and their boys.

In Season 3, Tommy seeks his help when a group of hackers running a memory upload service blackmail the town and seeks his help in stopping them, which results in the memories being downloaded into Tommy's brain, forcing Mr. Pickles to kill the hacker's leader and revive him to save Tommy and prevent Steve's memories from being revealed.\n\n==Secondary characters==\n===Mayor of Old Town===\nThe '''Mayor of Old Town''' (voiced by [[John Ennis (actor)|John Ennis]]) appears in the season 2 episode ''Mental Asylum''. Mr. Pickles accidentally kills the Mayor when he is with a prostitute, during one of Mr. Pickles' senseless acts of murder. Mr. Pickles later poses as the Mayor by using the Mayor's skin as a suit in order to free Grandpa Goodman from the asylum. Mr. Pickles makes the Mayor appear crazy at a town hall meeting by humping a female dog, allowing himself to be committed, which allows Mr. Pickles to get inside in order to free Grandpa.\n\n====Mayor's Wife====\n'''The Mayor's Wife''' (voiced by [[Kaitlyn Robrock]]) is a pompous woman who likes to flaunt her husband's status in front of others like Beverly Goodman, (saying \"My husband, the Mayor.\") She is unaware of her husband's unfaithfulness and was unable to tell Mr. Pickles was posing as her husband.

The Warden is then taken to Mr. Pickles' lair where he is given a lobotomy by one of the asylum patients (now mutated into a frog after identifying as one).

After Superhero Guy stole Tommy's leg braces, Tommy and Sidekick Boy attempt to help him by luring the now-elderly Superhero Guy into a rehab center using a piece of steel. Superhero Guy then stole the key to his secret base in hopes of selling the steel robot suit, but ended up using the suit to steal cars and a bridge to sell as metal. When Superhero Guy goes to the recycling plant, Mr. Pickles forces him into a large compacter but refrains from killing him when he notices Tommy's braces are inside, too. Superhero Guy then escapes, but ends up having his body fused into Crime Man's vehicle that Mr. Pickles rides in the night.\n\n====Sidekick Boy====\n''''Sidekick Boy''' (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) is the sidekick of Superhero Guy. When Superhero Guy became addicted to sh\u00f6venpucker after his identity was exposed, Sidekick Guy had to change the locks on their lair. Tommy later enlisted Sidekick Boy in an attempt to get him into a rehab. After Mr. Pickles fuses Superhero Guy to Crime Man's car and drives off into the night, Sidekick Boy advises Tommy not to reveal his secret identity if he ever becomes a superhero.\n\n===Crime Man===\n'''Crime Man''' (voiced by [[Bob Bergen]]) is a supervillain that terrorizes Old Town. He was responsible for blowing up the nursery which led to events that led to Superhero Guy accidentally getting unmasked.\n\nIn the present, Crime Man is still causing trouble. He is later killed by Mr. Pickles and his car is fused to Superhero Guy.\n\n===Dear Boy===\n'''Dear Boy''' is Bigfoot's son who resembles a talking deer with a human-like head, hands, and feet. Dear Boy is put under Tommy's protection when he wants to prove that he can be responsible, but Dear Boy's uncontrollable nature causes them to have a run-in with a couple of hunters. Dear Boy then has his foot caught in a bear trap and begs Tommy to euthanize him with a gun. However, his father soon rescues him just after his mother is killed. Due to him being part-human, Dear Boy is immune to Mr. Pickles' mind-controlling powers.\n\n===Jon Gabagooli===\n'''Jon Gabagooli''' (voiced by [[Frank Vincent]]) is the boss of the Gabagooli criminal family. He attempted to kill Vito Pizzarelli (now \"Bigfoot\") when he was sighted at a grocery store. After Mr. Pickles killed the other Gabagoolies, Jon was imprisoned in Mr. Pickles' lair and was made to help break into the grocery store to steal jumbo pickles. Jon managed to escape in season two, but was arrested by the Sheriff when he was caught trying to steal a car. Jon's daughter, Lisa Gabagoolie, frees him from jail by seducing the Sheriff and stealing his keys. Under the false belief that the Sheriff had sex with her, Jon attempts to kill him until Mr. Bojenkins and the sheriff's mother come to the rescue. Jon and his daughter escape the town in a car where they're confronted by what appears to be Mr. Pickles. Jon runs him over out of revenge, but discovers that it was actually a cardboard cut-out before the real Mr. Pickles rips his face off and shoots him in the mouth. As for Lisa, she flees with Mr. Pickles pursuing her, leaving her fate unknown.\n\n===Vegan Leader===\n'''Vegan Leader''' (voiced by [[Rob Zombie]]) is the leader of a quasi-religious group of vegans. He resembles a priest with a large beard that is constantly stroked by a pair of beautiful women. His body is covered in tattoos of vegan slogans and vegetables, and his genitals have been completely removed. Beverly is invited to his headquarters and greatly upsets him with her misunderstanding of veganism (she believes one can both eat animal products and be vegan at the same time). He attempts to convert her to veganism by showing her a fake slaughterhouse video and locking her in a cage like an animal. Fearing that Beverly's influence will corrupt the other vegans, he decides to perform an ancient vegan ceremony from \"hundreds and hundreds of months ago\". He tied Beverly to a large V while blindfolded so that they can beat the 'ignorance' out of her with hammers. Beverly is saved when a non-vegan pizza she delivered earlier arrives which causes the other vegans to give in. Mr. Pickles then arrives and kills the other vegans before they can taste the pizza and then kills the leader by impaling his skull with a giant carrot.\n\n===The Midget===\nThe Midget criminal suffering from dwarfism who pretends to be a child that Tommy befriends in Season 2. He dislikes being called a midget and often corrects people by telling them that the correct term is \"Little Person\". Though he ends up tricking Tommy into robbing a bank, he himself is later betrayed by his girlfriend and caught by the Sheriff. He has an antagonistic relationship with the Sheriff and harasses him on the Sheriff's mother's birthday in Season 3.\n\n===Principal Garcia===\n'''Principal Garcia''' is the principal of Old Town Elementary School, he is massively muscled, heavily-tattooed, and maintains a strict \"no dogs\" rule at the school, at first earning Mr. Pickles' ire. However, when spying on him intent on revenge, he learns Garcia was an ex-gang member, and is now earnestly focused on providing a good education and bright future to all his students, making Mr. Pickles decide to save him when his members of his former gang arrive to blackmail Garcia.\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Lists of characters in American television adult animation|Mr. Pickles]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2014|*, Mr. Pickles]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: she\u2019s \u2192 she's, 2014-2016 \u2192 2014\u20132016", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mr._Pickles_characters"}

He was a son of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]] by [[Asia (mythology)|Clymene]], one of the [[Oceanids]]. He was brother to [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. Hesiod, in ''Theogony'', introduces Prometheus as a lowly challenger to [[Zeus]]'s omniscience and omnipotence.\n\nIn the [[trick at Mecone]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D507 535\u2013544]), a sacrificial meal marking the \"settling of accounts\" between mortals and immortals, Prometheus played a trick against Zeus. He placed two [[sacrificial]] offerings before the Olympian: a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in \"glistening fat\" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for future sacrifices ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 556\u2013557]). Henceforth, humans would keep that meat for themselves and burn the bones wrapped in fat as an offering to the gods. This angered Zeus, who hid fire from humans in retribution. In this version of the myth, the use of fire was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.<ref>[[Martin Litchfield West|M. L. West]] commentaries on Hesiod, W.J. Verdenius commentaries on Hesiod, and R. Lamberton's ''Hesiod'', pp.95\u2013100.</ref> Prometheus, however, stole fire back in a [[Ferula communis|giant fennel-stalk]] and restored it to humanity ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 565\u2013566]). This further enraged Zeus, who sent the first woman to live with humanity ([[Pandora]], not explicitly mentioned). The woman, a \"shy maiden\", was fashioned by [[Hephaestus]] out of clay and Athena helped to adorn her properly ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 571\u2013574]). Hesiod writes, \"From her is the race of women and female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no [[wikt:helpmeet|helpmeets]] in hateful poverty, but only in wealth\" ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D585 590\u2013594]).\n\n[[File:Heinrich fueger 1817 prometheus brings fire to mankind.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Prometheus Brings Fire'' by [[Heinrich Friedrich F\u00fcger]]. Prometheus brings fire to mankind as told by Hesiod, with its having been hidden as revenge for the trick at Mecone.]]\n\nFor his crimes, Prometheus is punished by Zeus who bound him with chains, and sent an eagle to eat Prometheus' immortal liver every day, which then grew back every night. Years later, the Greek hero [[Heracles]], with Zeus' permission, killed the eagle and freed Prometheus from this torment ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D507 521\u2013529]).\n\n===== Works and Days =====\nHesiod revisits the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire in ''[[Works and Days]]'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 42\u2013105]). In it the poet expands upon Zeus's reaction to Prometheus' deception. Not only does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but \"the means of life\" as well ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 42]). Had Prometheus not provoked Zeus's wrath, \"you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste\" ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 44\u201347]).\n\nHesiod also adds more information to ''Theogony'''s story of the first woman, a maiden crafted from earth and water by Hephaestus now explicitly called Pandora (\"''all gifts''\") ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D59 82]). Zeus in this case gets the help of Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes, the [[Graces]] and the [[Horae|Hours]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D59 59\u201376]). After Prometheus steals the fire, Zeus sends Pandora in retaliation. Despite Prometheus' warning, Epimetheus accepts this \"gift\" from the gods ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D83 89]). [[Pandora's box|Pandora carried a jar with her]] from which were released mischief and sorrow, plague and diseases ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D83 94\u2013100]). Pandora shuts the lid of the jar too late to contain all the evil plights that escaped, but Hope is left trapped in the jar because Zeus forces Pandora to seal it up before Hope can escape ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D83 96\u201399]).\n\n=====Interpretation=====\nAngelo Casanova,<ref>Casanova, ''La famiglia di Pandora: analisi filologica dei miti di Pandora e Prometeo nella tradizione esiodea'' (Florence) 1979.</ref> professor of Greek literature at the University of Florence, finds in Prometheus a reflection of an ancient, pre-Hesiodic [[trickster]]-figure, who served to account for the mixture of good and bad in human life, and whose fashioning of humanity from clay was an Eastern motif familiar in ''[[Enuma Elish]]''. As an opponent of Zeus he was an analogue of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and, like them, was punished. As an advocate for humanity he gains semi-divine status at Athens, where the episode in ''Theogony'' in which he is liberated<ref>Hesiod, ''Theogony'', 526\u201333.</ref> is interpreted by Casanova as a post-Hesiodic interpolation.<ref>In this Casanova is joined by some editors of ''Theogony''.</ref>\n\nAccording to the German classicist [[:de:Karl-Martin Dietz|Karl-Martin Dietz]], in Hesiod's scriptures, Prometheus represents the \"descent of mankind from the communion with the gods into the present troublesome life\".<ref name=\"Karl-Martin Dietz 1989, p. 66\">Karl-Martin Dietz: Metamorphosen des Geistes.

West notes that surviving references suggest that there may have been significant differences between the Titanomachy epic and the account of events in Hesiod; and that the Titanomachy may be the source of later variants of the Prometheus myth not found in Hesiod, notably the non-Hesiodic material found in the [[Prometheus Bound]] of [[Aeschylus]].<ref>{{harvp|West|2002|pp=114}}, and 110\u2013118 for general discussion of Titanomachy.</ref>\n\n===Athenian tradition===\nThe two major authors to have an influence on the development of the myths and legends surrounding the Titan Prometheus during the Socratic era of greater Athens were [[Aeschylus]] and [[Plato]]. The two men wrote in highly distinctive forms of expression which for Aeschylus centered on his mastery of the literary form of Greek tragedy, while for Plato this centered on the philosophical expression of his thought in the form of the various dialogues he wrote or recorded during his lifetime.\n\n==== Aeschylus and the ancient literary tradition ====\n''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', perhaps the most famous treatment of the myth to be found among the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]], is traditionally attributed to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian [[Aeschylus]].<ref name=\"Theoi.com\"/> At the centre of the drama are the results of Prometheus' theft of fire and his current punishment by [[Zeus]]. The playwright's dependence on the Hesiodic source material is clear, though ''Prometheus Bound'' also includes a number of changes to the received tradition.<ref>Some of these changes are rather minor. For instance, rather than being the son of Iapetus and Clymene Prometheus becomes the son of [[Themis]] who is identified with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In addition, the chorus makes a passing reference (561) to Prometheus' wife [[Hesione (Oceanid)|Hesione]], whereas a fragment from Hesiod's ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' fr. 4 calls her \"Pryneie\", a possible corruption for Pronoia.</ref> It has been suggested by [[M.L. West]] that these changes may derive from the now lost epic [[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachy]]<ref>{{harvp|West|2002|pp=114}}, and 110\u2013118 for general discussion of Titanomachy.</ref>\n\nBefore his theft of fire, Prometheus played a decisive role in the [[Titanomachy]], securing victory for Zeus and the other Olympians. Zeus' torture of Prometheus thus becomes a particularly harsh betrayal. The scope and character of Prometheus' transgressions against Zeus are also widened. In addition to giving humanity fire, Prometheus claims to have taught them the arts of civilisation, such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. The Titan's greatest benefaction for humanity seems to have been saving them from complete destruction. In an apparent twist on the myth of the so-called Five [[Ages of Man]] found in Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' (wherein Cronus and, later, Zeus created and destroyed five successive races of humanity), Prometheus asserts that Zeus had wanted to obliterate the human race, but that he somehow stopped him.{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Herakles Prometheus Louvre MNE1309.jpg|thumb|right|Heracles freeing Prometheus from his torment by the eagle ([[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic]] [[black-figure]] cup, c. 500 BC)]]\nMoreover, Aeschylus anachronistically and artificially injects [[Io (mythology)|Io]], another victim of Zeus's violence and ancestor of Heracles, into Prometheus' story. Finally, just as Aeschylus gave Prometheus a key role in bringing Zeus to power, he also attributed to him secret knowledge that could lead to Zeus's downfall: Prometheus had been told by his mother [[Themis]], who in the play is identified with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth), of a potential marriage that would produce a son who would overthrow Zeus. Fragmentary evidence indicates that Heracles, as in Hesiod, frees the Titan in the trilogy's second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. It is apparently not until Prometheus reveals this secret of Zeus's potential downfall that the two reconcile in the final play, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'' or ''Prometheus Pyrphoros'', a lost tragedy by Aeschylus.\n\n''Prometheus Bound'' also includes two mythic innovations of omission. The first is the absence of [[Pandora]]'s story in connection with Prometheus' own. Instead, Aeschylus includes this one oblique allusion to Pandora and her jar that contained Hope (252): \"[Prometheus] caused blind hopes to live in the hearts of men.\" Second, Aeschylus makes no mention of the sacrifice-trick played against Zeus in the ''Theogony''.<ref name=\"Theoi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html |author=Aeschylus |title=Prometheus Bound |website=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> The four tragedies of Prometheus attributed to Aeschylus, most of which are lost to the passages of time into antiquity, are ''Prometheus Bound'' (''Prometheus Desmotes''), ''Prometheus Unbound'' (''Lyomenos''), ''Prometheus the Fire Bringer'' (''Pyrphoros''), and ''Prometheus the Fire Kindler'' (''Pyrkaeus'').\n\nThe larger scope of Aeschylus as a dramatist revisiting the myth of Prometheus in the age of Athenian prominence has been discussed by William Lynch.<ref>William Lynch, S.J. ''Christ and Prometheus''. University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> Lynch's general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod. For Lynch, modern scholarship is hampered by not having the full trilogy of Prometheus by Aeschylus, the last two parts of which have been lost to antiquity. Significantly, Lynch further comments that although the Prometheus trilogy is not available, that the ''Orestia'' trilogy by Aeschylus remains available and may be assumed to provide significant insight into the overall structural intentions which may be ascribed to the Prometheus trilogy by Aeschylus as an author of significant consistency and exemplary dramatic erudition.<ref>Lynch, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n[[Harold Bloom]], in his research guide for Aeschylus, has summarised some of the critical attention that has been applied to Aeschylus concerning his general philosophical import in Athens.<ref>Bloom, Harold (2002).

For generations, scholars warred incessantly over 'the justice of Zeus,' unintentionally blurring it with a monotheism imported from Judeo-Christian thought. The playwright undoubtedly had religious concerns; for instance, [[Jacqueline de Romilly]]<ref>de Romilly, Jacqueline (1968). ''Time in Greek Tragedy''. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1968), pp. 72\u201373, 77\u201381.</ref> suggests that his treatment of time flows directly out of his belief in divine justice.

As Rosenmeyer states: \"[T]he text defines their being. For a critic to construct an Aeschylean theology would be as quixotic as designing a typology of Aeschylean man.

Despite his importance to the myths and imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of Prometheus during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical periods]] seems to have been limited.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Prometheus, p. 46\">Dougherty, ''Prometheus'', p. 46.</ref> Writing in the 2nd century AD, the satirist [[Lucian]] points out that while temples to the major Olympians were everywhere, none to Prometheus is to be seen.<ref>Lucian, ''Prometheus'' 14.</ref>\n\n[[File:Heracles freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Heracles freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at [[Aphrodisias]]]]\n\nAthens was the exception, here Prometheus was worshipped alongside [[Athene]] and [[Hephaistos]].{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=58}} The altar of Prometheus in the grove of the [[Academy]] was the point of origin for several significant processions and other events regularly observed on the [[Athenian calendar]]. For the [[Panathenaic festival]], arguably the most important civic festival at Athens, a torch race began at the altar, which was located outside the sacred boundary of the city, and passed through the [[Kerameikos]], the district inhabited by [[Pottery of ancient Greece|potters]] and other artisans who regarded Prometheus and Hephaestus as patrons.<ref>On the association of the cults of Prometheus and Hephaestus, see also Scholiast to Sophocles, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' 56, as cited by Robert Parker, ''Polytheism and Society at Athens'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 472.</ref> The race then travelled to the heart of the city, where it kindled the sacrificial fire on the altar of Athena on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] to conclude the festival.<ref>Pausanias 1.30.2; Scholiast to Plato, ''Phaedrus'' 231e; Dougherty, ''Prometheus'', p. 46; Peter Wilson, ''The Athenian Institution of the'' Khoregia'': The Chorus, the City and the Stage'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 35.</ref> These footraces took the form of [[relay (race)|relays]] in which teams of runners passed off a flaming torch.

Although the classical tradition is that Hephaistos split Zeus's head to allow Athene's birth, that story has also been told of Prometheus. A variant tradition makes Prometheus the son of [[Hera]] like Hephaistos.{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=59}} Ancient artists depict Prometheus wearing the pointed cap of an artist or artisan, like Hephaistos, and also the crafty hero [[Odysseus]]. The artisan's cap was also depicted as worn by the [[Cabeiri]],{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|pp=50\u201351}} supernatural craftsmen associated with a mystery cult known in Athens in classical times, and who were associated with both Hephaistos and Prometheus.

Both [[Argos]] and [[Opous]] claimed to be Prometheus' final resting place, each erecting a tomb in his honour. The Greek city of [[Panopeus]] had a cult statue that was supposed to honour Prometheus for having created the human race there.<ref name=\"titan\"/>\n\n====Aesthetic tradition in Athenian art====\nPrometheus' torment by the eagle and his rescue by Heracles were popular subjects in vase paintings of the 6th to 4th centuries BC. He also sometimes appears in depictions of Athena's birth from Zeus' forehead. There was a relief sculpture of Prometheus with Pandora on the base of Athena's cult statue in the Athenian [[Parthenon]] of the 5th century BC. A similar rendering is also found at the great altar of Zeus at Pergamon from the second century BC.\n\nThe event of the release of Prometheus from captivity was frequently revisited on Attic and Etruscan vases between the sixth and fifth centuries BC. In the depiction on display at the Museum of Karlsruhe and in Berlin, the depiction is that of Prometheus confronted by a menacing large bird (assumed to be the eagle) with Hercules approaching from behind shooting his arrows at it.<ref>O. Jahn, ''Archeologische Beitrage'', Berlin, 1847, pl. VIII (Amphora from Chiusi).</ref> In the fourth century this imagery was modified to depicting Prometheus bound in a cruciform manner, possibly reflecting an Aeschylus-inspired manner of influence, again with an eagle and with Hercules approaching from the side.<ref>Milchhofer, ''Die Befreiung des Prometheus'' in ''Berliner Winckelmanns-Programme'', 1882, p. 1ff.</ref>\n\n=== Other authors ===\n[[File:Creation Prometheus Louvre Ma445.jpg|thumb|Creation of humanity by Prometheus as Athena looks on ([[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] relief, 3rd century AD)]]\n[[File:Griepenkerl, Beseelung der menschlichen Tonfigur durch Athena.jpg|thumb|Prometheus watches Athena endow his creation with reason (painting by [[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1877)]]\n\nSome two dozen other Greek and Roman authors retold and further embellished the Prometheus myth from as early as the 5th century BC ([[Diodorus]], [[Herodorus]]) into the 4th century AD. The most significant detail added to the myth found in, e.g., [[Sappho]], [[Aesop]] and [[Ovid]]<ref>Cf. Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', I, 78ff.</ref> was the central role of Prometheus in the creation of the human race. According to these sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.\n\nAlthough perhaps made explicit in the ''Prometheia'', later authors such as [[Hyginus]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', and [[Quintus of Smyrna]] would confirm that Prometheus warned Zeus not to marry the sea nymph [[Thetis]]. She is consequently married off to the mortal [[Peleus]], and bears him a son greater than the father \u2013 [[Achilles]], Greek hero of the [[Trojan War]]. Pseudo-Apollodorus moreover clarifies a cryptic statement (1026\u201329) made by Hermes in ''Prometheus Bound'', identifying the centaur [[Chiron]] as the one who would take on Prometheus' suffering and die in his place.<ref name=\"titan\" /> Reflecting a myth attested in Greek vase paintings from the Classical period, Pseudo-Apollodorus places the Titan (armed with an axe) at the birth of [[Athena]], thus explaining how the goddess sprang forth from the forehead of Zeus.<ref name=\"titan\" />\n\nOther minor details attached to the myth include: the duration of Prometheus' torment;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Prometheus.html |title=30 Years |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date=1997-11-10 |accessdate=2012-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530002156/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Prometheus.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Ther/AetosKaukasios.html |title=30,000 Years |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> the origin of the eagle that ate the Titan's liver (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus); Pandora's marriage to Epimetheus (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus); myths surrounding the life of Prometheus' son, [[Deucalion]] (found in Ovid and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]); and Prometheus' marginal role in the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] (found in Apollonius of Rhodes and [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]).<ref name=\"titan\"/>\n\n\"Variants of legends containing the Prometheus motif are widespread in the [[Caucasus]]\" region, reports Hunt,<ref>p. 14.

It is the first of these three which has drawn attention to parallels with the biblical creation account related in the religious symbolism expressed in the book of Genesis.\n\nAs stated by Olga Raggio,{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=48}} \"The Prometheus myth of creation as a visual symbol of the Neoplatonic concept of human nature, illustrated in (many) sarcophagi, was evidently a contradiction of the Christian teaching of the unique and simultaneous act of creation by the Trinity.\" This Neoplatonism of late Roman antiquity was especially stressed by Tertullian<ref>Tertullian. ''Apologeticum'' XVIII,3.</ref> who recognised both difference and similarity of the biblical deity with the mythological figure of Prometheus.\n\nThe imagery of Prometheus and the creation of man used for the purposes of the representation of the creation of Adam in biblical symbolism is also a recurrent theme in the artistic expression of late Roman antiquity. Of the relatively rare expressions found of the creation of Adam in those centuries of late Roman antiquity, one can single out the so-called \"Dogma sarcophagus\" of the Lateran Museum where three figures are seen (in representation of the theological trinity) in making a benediction to the new man. Another example is found where the prototype of Prometheus is also recognisable in the early Christian era of late Roman antiquity. This can be found upon a sarcophagus of the Church at Mas d'Aire<ref>Wilpert, J. (1932), I Sarcofagi Christiani, II, p. 226.</ref> as well, and in an even more direct comparison to what Raggio refers to as \"a coursely carved relief from Campli (Teramo)<ref>Wilpert, I, pl CVI, 2.</ref> (where) the Lord sits on a throne and models the body of Adam, exactly like Prometheus.\" Still another such similarity is found in the example found on a Hellenistic relief presently in the Louvre in which the Lord gives life to Eve through the imposition of his two fingers on her eyes recalling the same gesture found in earlier representations of Prometheus.{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=48}}\n\nIn [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] mythology, [[Amirani]] is a cultural hero who challenged the chief god and, like Prometheus, was chained on the Caucasian mountains where birds would eat his organs. This aspect of the myth had a significant influence on the Greek imagination. It is recognisable from a Greek gem roughly dated to the time of the Hesiod poems, which show Prometheus with hands bound behind his body and crouching before a bird with long wings.<ref>Furtwangler, ''Die Antiken Gemmen'', 1910, I, pl. V, no. 37.</ref> This same image would also be used later in the Rome of the Augustan age as documented by Furtwangler.<ref>Furtwangler, ''op. cit.'', pl. XXXVII, nos. 40, 41, 45, 46.</ref>\n\nIn the often cited and highly publicised interview between [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]] on Public Television, the author of ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' presented his view on the comparison of Prometheus and [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Campbell, Joseph. ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces.''</ref> Moyers asked Campbell the question in the following words, \"In this sense, unlike heroes such as Prometheus or Jesus, we're not going on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves.\" To which Campbell's well-known response was that, \"But in doing that, you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there's no doubt about it. The world without spirit is a wasteland. People have the notion of saving the world by shifting things around, changing the rules [...] No, no! Any world is a valid world if it's alive. The thing to do is to bring life to it, and the only way to do that is to find in your own case where the life is and become alive yourself.\" For Campbell, Jesus mortally suffered on the Cross while Prometheus eternally suffered while chained to a rock, and each of them received punishment for the gift which they bestowed to humankind, for Jesus this was the gift of propitiation from Heaven, and, for Prometheus this was the gift of fire from Olympus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSignificantly, Campbell is also clear to indicate the limits of applying the metaphors of his methodology in his book ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' too closely in assessing the comparison of Prometheus and Jesus. Of the four symbols of suffering associated with Jesus after his trial in Jerusalem (i) the crown of thorns, (ii) the scourge of whips, (iii) the nailing to the Cross, and (iv) the spearing of his side, it is only this last one which bears some resemblance to the eternal suffering of Prometheus' daily torment of an eagle devouring a replenishing organ, his liver, from his side.<ref>Lynch, William. ''Christ and Prometheus.''</ref> For Campbell, the striking contrast between the New Testament narratives and the Greek mythological narratives remains at the limiting level of the cataclysmic eternal struggle of the eschatological New Testament narratives occurring only at the very end of the biblical narratives in the ''Apocalypse of John'' (12:7) where, \"Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.\" This eschatological and apocalyptic setting of a Last Judgement is in precise contrast to the ''Titanomachia'' of Hesiod which serves its distinct service to Greek mythology as its ''Prolegomenon'', bracketing all subsequent mythology, including the creation of humanity, as coming after the cosmological struggle between the Titans and the Olympian gods.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt remains a continuing debate among scholars of comparative religion and the literary reception<ref>Dostoevski, Fyodor. ''The Brothers Karamazov'', chapter on \"The Grand Inquisitor\".</ref> of mythological and religious subject matter as to whether the typology of suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth finds its more representative comparisons with the narratives of the Hebrew scriptures or with the New Testament narratives. In the [[Book of Job]], significant comparisons can be drawn between the sustained suffering of Job in comparison to that of eternal suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth. With Job, the suffering is at the acquiescence of heaven and at the will of the demonic, while in Prometheus the suffering is directly linked to Zeus as the ruler of Olympus. The comparison of the suffering of Jesus after his sentencing in Jerusalem is limited to the three days, from Thursday to Saturday, and leading to the culminating narratives corresponding to Easter Sunday. The symbolic import for comparative religion would maintain that suffering related to justified conduct is redeemed in both the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament narratives, while in Prometheus there remains the image of a non-forgiving deity, Zeus, who nonetheless requires reverence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWriting in [[late antiquity]] of the fourth and fifth century, the Latin commentator Marcus [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] Honoratus explained that Prometheus was so named because he was a man of great foresight ''(vir prudentissimus)'', possessing the abstract quality of ''[[providentia]]'', the Latin equivalent of Greek ''prom\u0113theia'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}).<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Eclogue]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+Ecl.+6.42&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0091 6.42]: ''Prometheus vir prudentissimus fuit, unde etiam Prometheus dictus est'' {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}'', id est a providentia''.</ref> Anecdotally, the Roman [[fabulist]] [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (c.15 BC \u2013 c.50 AD) attributes to [[Aesop]] a simple [[etiology]] for [[homosexuality]], in Prometheus' getting drunk while creating the first humans and misapplying the genitalia.<ref name=\"Dionysos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosMyths2.html#Fable |title=Dionysos |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\nPerhaps the most influential book of the Middle Ages upon the reception of the Prometheus myth was the mythological handbook of Fulgentius Placiades. As stated by [[Olga Raggio|Raggio]],{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=53}} \"The text of Fulgentius, as well as that of (Marcus) Servius [...] are the main sources of the mythological handbooks written in the ninth century by the anonymous ''Mythographus Primus'' and ''Mythographus Secundus''. Both were used for the more lengthy and elaborate compendium by the English scholar [[Alexander Neckam|Alexander Neckman]] (1157\u20131217), the ''Scintillarium Poetarum'', or ''Poetarius''.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=53}} The purpose of his books was to distinguish allegorical interpretation from the historical interpretation of the Prometheus myth. Continuing in this same tradition of the allegorical interpretation of the Prometheus myth, along with the historical interpretation of the Middle Ages, is the ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium|Genealogiae]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Boccaccio follows these two levels of interpretation and distinguishes between two separate versions of the Prometheus myth. For Boccaccio, Prometheus is placed \"In the heavens where all is clarity and truth, [Prometheus] steals, so to speak, a ray of the divine wisdom from God himself, source of all Science, supreme Light of every man.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=54}} With this, Boccaccio shows himself moving from the mediaeval sources with a shift of accent towards the attitude of the Renaissance humanists.\n\nUsing a similar interpretation to that of Boccaccio, [[Marsilio Ficino]] in the fifteenth century updated the philosophical and more sombre reception of the Prometheus myth not seen since the time of [[Plotinus]]. In his book written in 1476\u201377 titled ''Quaestiones Quinque de Mente'', Ficino indicates his preference for reading the Prometheus myth as an image of the human soul seeking to obtain supreme truth. As [[Olga Raggio]] summarises Ficino's text, \"The torture of Prometheus is the torment brought by reason itself to man, who is made by it many times more unhappy than the brutes. It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light [...] that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and [...] only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=54}} This sombreness of attitude in Ficino's text would be further developed later by [[Charles de Bouelles]]' ''Liber de Sapiente'' of 1509 which presented a mix of both scholastic and [[Neoplatonic]] ideas.\n\n==Renaissance==\n[[File:Piero di cosimo, prometeo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Mythological narrative of Prometheus by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (1515)]]\nAfter the writings of both Boccaccio and Ficino in the late Middle Ages about Prometheus, interest in the Titan shifted considerably in the direction of becoming subject matter for painters and sculptors alike. Among the most famous examples is that of [[Piero di Cosimo]] from about 1510 presently on display at the museums of Munich and Strasburg (see Inset). Raggio summarises the Munich version<ref>Munich, ''Alte Pinakothek'', Katalog, 1930, no. 8973. Strasburg, ''Musee des Beaux Arts'', Catalog, 1932, no. 225.</ref> as follows; \"The Munich panel represents the dispute between Epimetheus and Prometheus, the handsome triumphant statue of the new man, modelled by Prometheus, his ascension to the sky under the guidance of Minerva; the Strasburg panel shows in the distance Prometheus lighting his torch at the wheels of the Sun, and in the foreground on one side, Prometheus applying his torch to the heart of the statue and, on the other, Mercury fastening him to a tree.\" All the details are evidently borrowed from [[Boccaccio]]'s ''Genealogiae''.\n\nThe same reference to the ''Genealogiae'' can be cited as the source for the drawing by [[Parmigianino]] presently located in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City.<ref>''Parmigianino: The Drawings'', Sylvie Beguin et al. {{ISBN|88-422-1020-X}}.</ref> In the drawing, a very noble rendering of Prometheus is presented which evokes the memory of Michelangelo's works portraying Jehovah. This drawing is perhaps one of the most intense examples of the visualisation of the myth of Prometheus from the Renaissance period.\n\nWriting in the late British Renaissance, William Shakespeare uses the Promethean allusion in the famous death scene of Desdemona in his tragedy of ''Othello''. Othello in contemplating the death of Desdemona asserts plainly that he cannot restore the \"Promethean heat\" to her body once it has been extinguished. For Shakespeare, the allusion is clearly to the interpretation of the fire from the heat as the bestowing of life to the creation of man from clay by Prometheus after it was stolen from Olympus. The analogy bears direct resemblance to the biblical narrative of the creation of life in Adam through the bestowed breathing of the creator in Genesis. Shakespeare's symbolic reference to the \"heat\" associated with Prometheus' fire is to the association of the gift of fire to the mythological gift or theological gift of life to humans.\n\n==Post-Renaissance==\n[[File:Thomas Cole - Prometheus Bound - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus Bound (Thomas Cole)|Prometheus Bound]]'' by Thomas Cole (1847)]]\n{{See also|Prometheus in popular culture}}\nThe myth of Prometheus has been a favourite theme of [[Western art]] and literature in the post-[[renaissance]] and post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tradition and, occasionally, in works produced outside the [[Western civilisation|West]].\n\n=== Post-Renaissance literary arts ===\nFor the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], Prometheus was the rebel who resisted all forms of institutional tyranny epitomised by Zeus \u2013 church, monarch, and patriarch. The Romantics drew comparisons between Prometheus and the spirit of the [[French Revolution]], [[Christ]], the [[Satan]] of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and the divinely inspired poet or artist. Prometheus is the lyrical \"I\" who speaks in [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poem [[Prometheus (Goethe)|\"Prometheus\"]] (written c. 1772\u201374, published 1789), addressing God (as Zeus) in [[misotheist]] accusation and defiance. In ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820), a four-act lyrical drama, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] rewrites the lost play of Aeschylus so that Prometheus does not submit to Zeus (under the Latin name Jupiter), but instead supplants him in a triumph of the human heart and intellect over tyrannical religion. [[Lord Byron]]'s poem \"Prometheus\" also portrays the Titan as unrepentant. As documented by Olga Raggio, other leading figures among the great Romantics included Byron, Longfellow and Nietzsche as well.<ref name=\"Raggio\" /> [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is subtitled \"The Modern Prometheus\", in reference to the novel's themes of the over-reaching of modern humanity into dangerous areas of knowledge.\n\n====Goethe's poems====\n{{Listen|type=speech|image=none|filename=De-Prometheus Gedicht-wikisource.ogg|title=\"Prometheus\"|description=spoken {{in lang|de}}<br />(2:06 minutes, 1 [[Megabyte|MB]])}}\n''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]'' is a poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], in which a character based on the mythic Prometheus addresses God (as [[Zeus]]) in a romantic and [[Misotheism|misotheist]] tone of accusation and defiance. The poem was written between 1772 and 1774. It was first published fifteen years later in 1789. It is an important work as it represents one of the first encounters of the Prometheus myth with the literary Romantic movement identified with Goethe and with the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement.\n\nThe poem has appeared in Volume 6 of Goethe's poems (in his Collected Works) in a section of ''{{Lang|de|Vermischte Gedichte}}'' (assorted poems), shortly following the ''[[Harzreise im Winter]]''. It is immediately followed by [[Ganymed (Goethe)|\"Ganymed\"]], and the two poems are written as informing each other according to Goethe's plan in their actual writing. ''Prometheus'' (1774) was originally planned as a drama but never completed by Goethe, though the poem is inspired by it. Prometheus is the creative and rebellious spirit rejected by God and who angrily defies him and asserts himself. [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], by direct contrast, is the boyish self who is both adored and seduced by God. As a high Romantic poet and a humanist poet, Goethe presents both identities as contrasting aspects of the Romantic human condition.\n\nThe poem offers direct biblical connotations for the Prometheus myth which was unseen in any of the ancient Greek poets dealing with the Prometheus myth in either drama, tragedy, or philosophy. The intentional use of the German phrase \"{{Lang|de|Da ich ein Kind war...}}\" (\"When I was a child\"): the use of ''{{Lang|de|Da}}'' is distinctive, and with it Goethe directly applies the [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]] translation of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]'s [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#13:11|13:11]]: \"{{Lang|de|Da ich ein Kind war, da redete ich wie ein Kind...}}\" (\"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things\"). Goethe's Prometheus is significant for the contrast it evokes with the biblical text of the Corinthians rather than for its similarities.\n\nIn his book titled ''Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence'', C. Ker\u00e9nyi states the key contrast between Goethe's version of Prometheus with the ancient Greek version.{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=11}} As Ker\u00e9nyi states, \"Goethe's Prometheus had Zeus for father and a goddess for mother. With this change from the traditional lineage the poet distinguished his hero from the race of the Titans.\" For Goethe, the metaphorical comparison of Prometheus to the image of the Son from the New Testament narratives was of central importance, with the figure of Zeus in Goethe's reading being metaphorically matched directly to the image of the Father from the New Testament narratives.\n\n====Percy Bysshe Shelley====\n[[Percy Shelley]] published his four-act lyrical drama titled ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' in 1820. His version was written in response to the version of myth as presented by Aeschylus and is orientated to the high British Idealism and high British Romanticism prevailing in Shelley's own time. Shelley, as the author himself discusses, admits the debt of his version of the myth to [[Aeschylus]] and the Greek poetic tradition which he assumes is familiar to readers of his own lyrical drama. For example, it is necessary to understand and have knowledge of the reason for Prometheus' punishment if the reader is to form an understanding of whether the exoneration portrayed by Shelley in his version of the Prometheus myth is justified or unjustified. The quote of Shelley's own words describing the extent of his indebtedness to Aeschylus has been published in numerous sources publicly available.\n\nThe literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] in his book ''Shelley's Mythmaking'' expresses his high expectation of Shelley in the tradition of mythopoeic poetry. For Bloom, Percy Shelley's relationship to the tradition of mythology in poetry \"culminates in 'Prometheus'. The poem provides a complete statement of Shelley's vision.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold (1959). ''Shelley's Mythmaking,'' Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, p. 9.</ref> Bloom devotes two full chapters in this book to Shelley's lyrical drama ''Prometheus Unbound'' which was among the first books Bloom had ever written, originally published in 1959.<ref>Bloom (1959), Chapter 3.</ref> Following his 1959 book, Bloom edited an anthology of critical opinions on Shelley for Chelsea House Publishers where he concisely stated his opinion as, \"Shelley is the unacknowledged ancestor of Wallace Stevens' conception of poetry as the Supreme Fiction, and ''Prometheus Unbound'' is the most capable imagining, outside of Blake and Wordsworth, that the Romantic quest for a Supreme Fiction has achieved.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p.8. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref>\n\nWithin the pages of his Introduction to the Chelsea House edition on Percy Shelley, Harold Bloom also identifies the six major schools of criticism opposing Shelley's idealised mythologising version of the Prometheus myth. In sequence, the opposing schools to Shelley are given as: (i) The school of \"common sense\", (ii) The Christian orthodox, (iii) The school of \"wit\", (iv) Moralists, of most varieties, (v) The school of \"classic\" form, and (vi) The Precisionists, or concretists.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p. 27. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref> Although Bloom is least interested in the first two schools, the second one on the Christian orthodox has special bearing on the reception of the Prometheus myth during late Roman antiquity and the synthesis of the New Testament canon. The Greek origins of the Prometheus myth have already discussed the ''Titanomachia'' as placing the cosmic struggle of Olympus at some point in time preceding the creation of humanity, while in the New Testament synthesis there was a strong assimilation of the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew prophets and their strongly eschatological orientation. This contrast placed a strong emphasis within the ancient Greek consciousness as to the moral and ontological acceptance of the mythology of the ''Titanomachia'' as an accomplished mythological history, whereas for the synthesis of the New Testament narratives this placed religious consciousness within the community at the level of an anticipated ''eschaton'' not yet accomplished. Neither of these would guide Percy Shelley in his poetic retelling and re-integration of the Prometheus myth.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1959). ''Shelley's Mythmaking,'' Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, p. 29.</ref>\n\nTo the Socratic Greeks, one important aspect of the discussion of religion would correspond to the philosophical discussion of 'becoming' with respect to the New Testament syncretism rather than the ontological discussion of 'being' which was more prominent in the ancient Greek experience of mythologically oriented cult and religion.<ref>Heidegger, Martin. ''Being and Time.''</ref> For Percy Shelley, both of these reading were to be substantially discounted in preference to his own concerns for promoting his own version of an idealised consciousness of a society guided by the precepts of High British Romanticism and High British Idealism.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p. 28. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref>\n\n====''Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus''====\n''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]'', written by Mary Shelley when she was 18, was published in 1818, two years before Percy Shelley's above-mentioned play. It has endured as one of the most frequently revisited literary themes in twentieth century film and popular reception with few rivals for its sheer popularity among even established literary works of art. The primary theme is a parallel to the aspect of the Prometheus myth which concentrates on the creation of man by the Titans, transferred and made contemporary by Shelley for British audiences of her time. The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural acts of reproduction. The short novel has been adapted into many films and productions ranging from the early versions with [[Boris Karloff]] to later versions featuring [[Kenneth Branagh]].\n\n====Twentieth century====\n[[File:Otto Greiner - Prometheus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Prometheus'' (1909) by [[Otto Greiner]]]]\n[[Franz Kafka]] wrote a short piece titled \"[[Prometheus (short story)|Prometheus]],\" outlining what he saw as his perspective on four aspects of his myth:\n<blockquote>''According to the first, he was clamped to a rock in the Caucasus for betraying the secrets of the gods to men, and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver, which was perpetually renewed.<br> According to the second, Prometheus, goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks, pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it.<br> According to the third, his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years, forgotten by the gods, the eagles, forgotten by himself.<br> According to the fourth, everyone grew weary of the meaningless affair. The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.<br>There remains the inexplicable mass of rock. The legend tried to explain the inexplicable. As it came out of a substratum of truth it had in turn to end in the inexplicable.''<ref>Translated by Willa and [[Edwin Muir]]. See Glatzer, Nahum N., ed. \"Franz Kafka: The Complete Stories\" Schocken Book, Inc.: New York, 1971.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis short piece by Kafka concerning his interest in Prometheus was supplemented by two other mythological pieces written by him. As stated by Reiner Stach, \"Kafka's world was mythical in nature, with Old Testament and Jewish legends providing the templates. It was only logical (even if Kafka did not state it openly) that he would try his hand at the canon of antiquity, re-interpreting it and incorporating it into his own imagination in the form of allusions, as in 'The Silence of the Sirens,' 'Prometheus,' and 'Poseidon.'\"<ref>Stach, Reiner (3013). ''Kafka: The years of Insight'', Princeton University Press, English translation.</ref> Among contemporary poets, the British poet [[Ted Hughes]] wrote a 1973 collection of poems titled ''Prometheus on His Crag''. The [[Nepal]]i poet [[Laxmi Prasad Devkota]] (d. 1949) also wrote an epic titled ''Prometheus'' (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0940\u0925\u0938).\n\nIn his 1952 book, ''[[Lucifer and Prometheus]]'', [[R.J. Zwi Werblowsky|Zvi Werblowsky]] presented the speculatively derived Jungian construction of the character of Satan in Milton's celebrated poem ''Paradise Lost''. Werblowsky applied his own Jungian style of interpretation to appropriate parts of the Prometheus myth for the purpose of interpreting Milton. A reprint of his book in the 1990s by Routledge Press included an introduction to the book by Carl Jung. Some [[Gnostics]] have been associated with identifying the theft of fire from heaven as embodied by the fall of Lucifer \"the Light Bearer\".<ref>R.J.

He was a son of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]] by [[Asia (mythology)|Clymene]], one of the [[Oceanids]]. He was brother to [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]], [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], and [[Epimetheus (mythology)|Epimetheus]]. Hesiod, in ''Theogony'', introduces Prometheus as a lowly challenger to [[Zeus]]'s omniscience and omnipotence.\n\nIn the [[trick at Mecone]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D507 535\u2013544]), a sacrificial meal marking the \"settling of accounts\" between mortals and immortals, Prometheus played a trick against Zeus. He placed two [[sacrificial]] offerings before the Olympian: a selection of beef hidden inside an ox's stomach (nourishment hidden inside a displeasing exterior), and the bull's bones wrapped completely in \"glistening fat\" (something inedible hidden inside a pleasing exterior). Zeus chose the latter, setting a precedent for future sacrifices ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 556\u2013557]). Henceforth, humans would keep that meat for themselves and burn the bones wrapped in fat as an offering to the gods. This angered Zeus, who hid fire from humans in retribution. In this version of the myth, the use of fire was already known to humans, but withdrawn by Zeus.<ref>[[Martin Litchfield West|M. L. West]] commentaries on Hesiod, W.J. Verdenius commentaries on Hesiod, and R. Lamberton's ''Hesiod'', pp.95\u2013100.</ref> Prometheus, however, stole fire back in a [[Ferula communis|giant fennel-stalk]] and restored it to humanity ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 565\u2013566]). This further enraged Zeus, who sent the first woman to live with humanity ([[Pandora]], not explicitly mentioned). The woman, a \"shy maiden\", was fashioned by [[Hephaestus]] out of clay and Athena helped to adorn her properly ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D545 571\u2013574]). Hesiod writes, \"From her is the race of women and female kind: of her is the deadly race and tribe of women who live amongst mortal men to their great trouble, no [[wikt:helpmeet|helpmeets]] in hateful poverty, but only in wealth\" ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D585 590\u2013594]).\n\n[[File:Heinrich fueger 1817 prometheus brings fire to mankind.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Prometheus Brings Fire'' by [[Heinrich Friedrich F\u00fcger]].

Years later, the Greek hero [[Heracles]], with Zeus' permission, killed the eagle and freed Prometheus from this torment ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D507 521\u2013529]).\n\n===== Works and Days =====\nHesiod revisits the story of Prometheus and the theft of fire in ''[[Works and Days]]'' ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 42\u2013105]). In it the poet expands upon Zeus's reaction to Prometheus' deception. Not only does Zeus withhold fire from humanity, but \"the means of life\" as well ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 42]). Had Prometheus not provoked Zeus's wrath, \"you would easily do work enough in a day to supply you for a full year even without working; soon would you put away your rudder over the smoke, and the fields worked by ox and sturdy mule would run to waste\" ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42 44\u201347]).\n\nHesiod also adds more information to ''Theogony'''s story of the first woman, a maiden crafted from earth and water by Hephaestus now explicitly called Pandora (\"''all gifts''\") ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D59 82]). Zeus in this case gets the help of Athena, Aphrodite, Hermes, the [[Graces]] and the [[Horae|Hours]] ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D59 59\u201376]). After Prometheus steals the fire, Zeus sends Pandora in retaliation. Despite Prometheus' warning, Epimetheus accepts this \"gift\" from the gods ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D83 89]).

As an opponent of Zeus he was an analogue of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and, like them, was punished. As an advocate for humanity he gains semi-divine status at Athens, where the episode in ''Theogony'' in which he is liberated<ref>Hesiod, ''Theogony'', 526\u201333.</ref> is interpreted by Casanova as a post-Hesiodic interpolation.<ref>In this Casanova is joined by some editors of ''Theogony''.</ref>\n\nAccording to the German classicist [[:de:Karl-Martin Dietz|Karl-Martin Dietz]], in Hesiod's scriptures, Prometheus represents the \"descent of mankind from the communion with the gods into the present troublesome life\".<ref name=\"Karl-Martin Dietz 1989, p. 66\">Karl-Martin Dietz: Metamorphosen des Geistes.

The two men wrote in highly distinctive forms of expression which for Aeschylus centered on his mastery of the literary form of Greek tragedy, while for Plato this centered on the philosophical expression of his thought in the form of the various dialogues he wrote or recorded during his lifetime.\n\n==== Aeschylus and the ancient literary tradition ====\n''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', perhaps the most famous treatment of the myth to be found among the [[Greek tragedy|Greek tragedies]], is traditionally attributed to the 5th-century BC Greek tragedian [[Aeschylus]].<ref name=\"Theoi.com\"/> At the centre of the drama are the results of Prometheus' theft of fire and his current punishment by [[Zeus]]. The playwright's dependence on the Hesiodic source material is clear, though ''Prometheus Bound'' also includes a number of changes to the received tradition.<ref>Some of these changes are rather minor. For instance, rather than being the son of Iapetus and Clymene Prometheus becomes the son of [[Themis]] who is identified with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]. In addition, the chorus makes a passing reference (561) to Prometheus' wife [[Hesione (Oceanid)|Hesione]], whereas a fragment from Hesiod's ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' fr. 4 calls her \"Pryneie\", a possible corruption for Pronoia.</ref> It has been suggested by [[M.L. West]] that these changes may derive from the now lost epic [[Titanomachy (epic poem)|Titanomachy]]<ref>{{harvp|West|2002|pp=114}}, and 110\u2013118 for general discussion of Titanomachy.</ref>\n\nBefore his theft of fire, Prometheus played a decisive role in the [[Titanomachy]], securing victory for Zeus and the other Olympians. Zeus' torture of Prometheus thus becomes a particularly harsh betrayal. The scope and character of Prometheus' transgressions against Zeus are also widened. In addition to giving humanity fire, Prometheus claims to have taught them the arts of civilisation, such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science. The Titan's greatest benefaction for humanity seems to have been saving them from complete destruction. In an apparent twist on the myth of the so-called Five [[Ages of Man]] found in Hesiod's ''Works and Days'' (wherein Cronus and, later, Zeus created and destroyed five successive races of humanity), Prometheus asserts that Zeus had wanted to obliterate the human race, but that he somehow stopped him.{{cn|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Herakles Prometheus Louvre MNE1309.jpg|thumb|right|Heracles freeing Prometheus from his torment by the eagle ([[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic]] [[black-figure]] cup, c. 500 BC)]]\nMoreover, Aeschylus anachronistically and artificially injects [[Io (mythology)|Io]], another victim of Zeus's violence and ancestor of Heracles, into Prometheus' story. Finally, just as Aeschylus gave Prometheus a key role in bringing Zeus to power, he also attributed to him secret knowledge that could lead to Zeus's downfall: Prometheus had been told by his mother [[Themis]], who in the play is identified with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Earth), of a potential marriage that would produce a son who would overthrow Zeus. Fragmentary evidence indicates that Heracles, as in Hesiod, frees the Titan in the trilogy's second play, ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Aeschylus)|Prometheus Unbound]]''. It is apparently not until Prometheus reveals this secret of Zeus's potential downfall that the two reconcile in the final play, ''[[Prometheus the Fire-Bringer]]'' or ''Prometheus Pyrphoros'', a lost tragedy by Aeschylus.\n\n''Prometheus Bound'' also includes two mythic innovations of omission. The first is the absence of [[Pandora]]'s story in connection with Prometheus' own. Instead, Aeschylus includes this one oblique allusion to Pandora and her jar that contained Hope (252): \"[Prometheus] caused blind hopes to live in the hearts of men.\" Second, Aeschylus makes no mention of the sacrifice-trick played against Zeus in the ''Theogony''.<ref name=\"Theoi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html |author=Aeschylus |title=Prometheus Bound |website=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> The four tragedies of Prometheus attributed to Aeschylus, most of which are lost to the passages of time into antiquity, are ''Prometheus Bound'' (''Prometheus Desmotes''), ''Prometheus Unbound'' (''Lyomenos''), ''Prometheus the Fire Bringer'' (''Pyrphoros''), and ''Prometheus the Fire Kindler'' (''Pyrkaeus'').\n\nThe larger scope of Aeschylus as a dramatist revisiting the myth of Prometheus in the age of Athenian prominence has been discussed by William Lynch.<ref>William Lynch, S.J. ''Christ and Prometheus''. University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> Lynch's general thesis concerns the rise of humanist and secular tendencies in Athenian culture and society which required the growth and expansion of the mythological and religious tradition as acquired from the most ancient sources of the myth stemming from Hesiod. For Lynch, modern scholarship is hampered by not having the full trilogy of Prometheus by Aeschylus, the last two parts of which have been lost to antiquity. Significantly, Lynch further comments that although the Prometheus trilogy is not available, that the ''Orestia'' trilogy by Aeschylus remains available and may be assumed to provide significant insight into the overall structural intentions which may be ascribed to the Prometheus trilogy by Aeschylus as an author of significant consistency and exemplary dramatic erudition.<ref>Lynch, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\n[[Harold Bloom]], in his research guide for Aeschylus, has summarised some of the critical attention that has been applied to Aeschylus concerning his general philosophical import in Athens.<ref>Bloom, Harold (2002). ''Bloom's Major Dramatists: Aeschylus''. Chelsea House Publishers.</ref> As Bloom states, \"Much critical attention has been paid to the question of theodicy in Aeschylus. For generations, scholars warred incessantly over 'the justice of Zeus,' unintentionally blurring it with a monotheism imported from Judeo-Christian thought. The playwright undoubtedly had religious concerns; for instance, [[Jacqueline de Romilly]]<ref>de Romilly, Jacqueline (1968). ''Time in Greek Tragedy''. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1968), pp. 72\u201373, 77\u201381.</ref> suggests that his treatment of time flows directly out of his belief in divine justice. But it would be an error to think of Aeschylus as sermonising. His Zeus does not arrive at decisions which he then enacts in the mortal world; rather, human events are themselves an enactment of divine will.\"<ref>\"Bloom's Major Dramatists,\" pp.&nbsp;14\u201315.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Thomas Rosenmeyer]], regarding the religious import of Aeschylus, \"In Aeschylus, as in Homer, the two levels of causation, the supernatural and the human, are co-existent and simultaneous, two ways of describing the same event.\" Rosenmeyer insists that ascribing portrayed characters in Aeschylus should not conclude them to be either victims or agents of theological or religious activity too quickly. As Rosenmeyer states: \"[T]he text defines their being. For a critic to construct an Aeschylean theology would be as quixotic as designing a typology of Aeschylean man. The needs of the drama prevail.\"<ref>Rosenmeyer, Thomas (1982). ''The Art of Aeschylus''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1982, pp. 270\u201371, 281\u201383.</ref>\n\nIn a rare comparison of Prometheus in Aeschylus with Oedipus in Sophocles, Harold Bloom states that \"Freud called ''Oedipus'' an 'immoral play,' since the gods ordained incest and parricide. Oedipus therefore participates in our universal unconscious sense of guilt, but on this reading so do the gods\" [...] \"I sometimes wish that Freud had turned to Aeschylus instead, and given us the Prometheus complex rather than the Oedipus complex.\"<ref>Harold Bloom.

Despite his importance to the myths and imaginative literature of ancient Greece, the religious cult of Prometheus during the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and [[Classical Greece|Classical periods]] seems to have been limited.<ref name=\"Dougherty, Prometheus, p. 46\">Dougherty, ''Prometheus'', p. 46.</ref> Writing in the 2nd century AD, the satirist [[Lucian]] points out that while temples to the major Olympians were everywhere, none to Prometheus is to be seen.<ref>Lucian, ''Prometheus'' 14.</ref>\n\n[[File:Heracles freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at Aphrodisias.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Heracles freeing Prometheus, relief from the Temple of Aphrodite at [[Aphrodisias]]]]\n\nAthens was the exception, here Prometheus was worshipped alongside [[Athene]] and [[Hephaistos]].{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=58}} The altar of Prometheus in the grove of the [[Academy]] was the point of origin for several significant processions and other events regularly observed on the [[Athenian calendar]]. For the [[Panathenaic festival]], arguably the most important civic festival at Athens, a torch race began at the altar, which was located outside the sacred boundary of the city, and passed through the [[Kerameikos]], the district inhabited by [[Pottery of ancient Greece|potters]] and other artisans who regarded Prometheus and Hephaestus as patrons.<ref>On the association of the cults of Prometheus and Hephaestus, see also Scholiast to Sophocles, ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' 56, as cited by Robert Parker, ''Polytheism and Society at Athens'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 472.</ref> The race then travelled to the heart of the city, where it kindled the sacrificial fire on the altar of Athena on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] to conclude the festival.<ref>Pausanias 1.30.2; Scholiast to Plato, ''Phaedrus'' 231e; Dougherty, ''Prometheus'', p. 46; Peter Wilson, ''The Athenian Institution of the'' Khoregia'': The Chorus, the City and the Stage'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 35.</ref> These footraces took the form of [[relay (race)|relays]] in which teams of runners passed off a flaming torch.

Although the classical tradition is that Hephaistos split Zeus's head to allow Athene's birth, that story has also been told of Prometheus. A variant tradition makes Prometheus the son of [[Hera]] like Hephaistos.{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=59}} Ancient artists depict Prometheus wearing the pointed cap of an artist or artisan, like Hephaistos, and also the crafty hero [[Odysseus]]. The artisan's cap was also depicted as worn by the [[Cabeiri]],{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|pp=50\u201351}} supernatural craftsmen associated with a mystery cult known in Athens in classical times, and who were associated with both Hephaistos and Prometheus.

Both [[Argos]] and [[Opous]] claimed to be Prometheus' final resting place, each erecting a tomb in his honour. The Greek city of [[Panopeus]] had a cult statue that was supposed to honour Prometheus for having created the human race there.<ref name=\"titan\"/>\n\n====Aesthetic tradition in Athenian art====\nPrometheus' torment by the eagle and his rescue by Heracles were popular subjects in vase paintings of the 6th to 4th centuries BC. He also sometimes appears in depictions of Athena's birth from Zeus' forehead. There was a relief sculpture of Prometheus with Pandora on the base of Athena's cult statue in the Athenian [[Parthenon]] of the 5th century BC. A similar rendering is also found at the great altar of Zeus at Pergamon from the second century BC.\n\nThe event of the release of Prometheus from captivity was frequently revisited on Attic and Etruscan vases between the sixth and fifth centuries BC. In the depiction on display at the Museum of Karlsruhe and in Berlin, the depiction is that of Prometheus confronted by a menacing large bird (assumed to be the eagle) with Hercules approaching from behind shooting his arrows at it.<ref>O. Jahn, ''Archeologische Beitrage'', Berlin, 1847, pl. VIII (Amphora from Chiusi).</ref> In the fourth century this imagery was modified to depicting Prometheus bound in a cruciform manner, possibly reflecting an Aeschylus-inspired manner of influence, again with an eagle and with Hercules approaching from the side.<ref>Milchhofer, ''Die Befreiung des Prometheus'' in ''Berliner Winckelmanns-Programme'', 1882, p. 1ff.</ref>\n\n=== Other authors ===\n[[File:Creation Prometheus Louvre Ma445.jpg|thumb|Creation of humanity by Prometheus as Athena looks on ([[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] relief, 3rd century AD)]]\n[[File:Griepenkerl, Beseelung der menschlichen Tonfigur durch Athena.jpg|thumb|Prometheus watches Athena endow his creation with reason (painting by [[Christian Griepenkerl]], 1877)]]\n\nSome two dozen other Greek and Roman authors retold and further embellished the Prometheus myth from as early as the 5th century BC ([[Diodorus]], [[Herodorus]]) into the 4th century AD. The most significant detail added to the myth found in, e.g., [[Sappho]], [[Aesop]] and [[Ovid]]<ref>Cf. Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', I, 78ff.</ref> was the central role of Prometheus in the creation of the human race. According to these sources, Prometheus fashioned humans out of clay.\n\nAlthough perhaps made explicit in the ''Prometheia'', later authors such as [[Hyginus]], the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'', and [[Quintus of Smyrna]] would confirm that Prometheus warned Zeus not to marry the sea nymph [[Thetis]]. She is consequently married off to the mortal [[Peleus]], and bears him a son greater than the father \u2013 [[Achilles]], Greek hero of the [[Trojan War]]. Pseudo-Apollodorus moreover clarifies a cryptic statement (1026\u201329) made by Hermes in ''Prometheus Bound'', identifying the centaur [[Chiron]] as the one who would take on Prometheus' suffering and die in his place.<ref name=\"titan\" /> Reflecting a myth attested in Greek vase paintings from the Classical period, Pseudo-Apollodorus places the Titan (armed with an axe) at the birth of [[Athena]], thus explaining how the goddess sprang forth from the forehead of Zeus.<ref name=\"titan\" />\n\nOther minor details attached to the myth include: the duration of Prometheus' torment;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Prometheus.html |title=30 Years |publisher=Mlahanas.de |date=1997-11-10 |accessdate=2012-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530002156/http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Prometheus.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Ther/AetosKaukasios.html |title=30,000 Years |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref> the origin of the eagle that ate the Titan's liver (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus and Hyginus); Pandora's marriage to Epimetheus (found in Pseudo-Apollodorus); myths surrounding the life of Prometheus' son, [[Deucalion]] (found in Ovid and [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]); and Prometheus' marginal role in the myth of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] (found in Apollonius of Rhodes and [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]).<ref name=\"titan\"/>\n\n\"Variants of legends containing the Prometheus motif are widespread in the [[Caucasus]]\" region, reports Hunt,<ref>p. 14.

It is the first of these three which has drawn attention to parallels with the biblical creation account related in the religious symbolism expressed in the book of Genesis.\n\nAs stated by Olga Raggio,{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=48}} \"The Prometheus myth of creation as a visual symbol of the Neoplatonic concept of human nature, illustrated in (many) sarcophagi, was evidently a contradiction of the Christian teaching of the unique and simultaneous act of creation by the Trinity.\" This Neoplatonism of late Roman antiquity was especially stressed by Tertullian<ref>Tertullian. ''Apologeticum'' XVIII,3.</ref> who recognised both difference and similarity of the biblical deity with the mythological figure of Prometheus.\n\nThe imagery of Prometheus and the creation of man used for the purposes of the representation of the creation of Adam in biblical symbolism is also a recurrent theme in the artistic expression of late Roman antiquity. Of the relatively rare expressions found of the creation of Adam in those centuries of late Roman antiquity, one can single out the so-called \"Dogma sarcophagus\" of the Lateran Museum where three figures are seen (in representation of the theological trinity) in making a benediction to the new man. Another example is found where the prototype of Prometheus is also recognisable in the early Christian era of late Roman antiquity. This can be found upon a sarcophagus of the Church at Mas d'Aire<ref>Wilpert, J. (1932), I Sarcofagi Christiani, II, p. 226.</ref> as well, and in an even more direct comparison to what Raggio refers to as \"a coursely carved relief from Campli (Teramo)<ref>Wilpert, I, pl CVI, 2.</ref> (where) the Lord sits on a throne and models the body of Adam, exactly like Prometheus.\" Still another such similarity is found in the example found on a Hellenistic relief presently in the Louvre in which the Lord gives life to Eve through the imposition of his two fingers on her eyes recalling the same gesture found in earlier representations of Prometheus.{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=48}}\n\nIn [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] mythology, [[Amirani]] is a cultural hero who challenged the chief god and, like Prometheus, was chained on the Caucasian mountains where birds would eat his organs. This aspect of the myth had a significant influence on the Greek imagination. It is recognisable from a Greek gem roughly dated to the time of the Hesiod poems, which show Prometheus with hands bound behind his body and crouching before a bird with long wings.<ref>Furtwangler, ''Die Antiken Gemmen'', 1910, I, pl. V, no. 37.</ref> This same image would also be used later in the Rome of the Augustan age as documented by Furtwangler.<ref>Furtwangler, ''op. cit.'', pl. XXXVII, nos. 40, 41, 45, 46.</ref>\n\nIn the often cited and highly publicised interview between [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Bill Moyers]] on Public Television, the author of ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' presented his view on the comparison of Prometheus and [[Jesus Christ|Jesus]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Campbell, Joseph. ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces.''</ref> Moyers asked Campbell the question in the following words, \"In this sense, unlike heroes such as Prometheus or Jesus, we're not going on our journey to save the world but to save ourselves.\" To which Campbell's well-known response was that, \"But in doing that, you save the world. The influence of a vital person vitalizes, there's no doubt about it. The world without spirit is a wasteland. People have the notion of saving the world by shifting things around, changing the rules [...] No, no! Any world is a valid world if it's alive. The thing to do is to bring life to it, and the only way to do that is to find in your own case where the life is and become alive yourself.\" For Campbell, Jesus mortally suffered on the Cross while Prometheus eternally suffered while chained to a rock, and each of them received punishment for the gift which they bestowed to humankind, for Jesus this was the gift of propitiation from Heaven, and, for Prometheus this was the gift of fire from Olympus.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSignificantly, Campbell is also clear to indicate the limits of applying the metaphors of his methodology in his book ''The Hero with a Thousand Faces'' too closely in assessing the comparison of Prometheus and Jesus. Of the four symbols of suffering associated with Jesus after his trial in Jerusalem (i) the crown of thorns, (ii) the scourge of whips, (iii) the nailing to the Cross, and (iv) the spearing of his side, it is only this last one which bears some resemblance to the eternal suffering of Prometheus' daily torment of an eagle devouring a replenishing organ, his liver, from his side.<ref>Lynch, William. ''Christ and Prometheus.''</ref> For Campbell, the striking contrast between the New Testament narratives and the Greek mythological narratives remains at the limiting level of the cataclysmic eternal struggle of the eschatological New Testament narratives occurring only at the very end of the biblical narratives in the ''Apocalypse of John'' (12:7) where, \"Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.\" This eschatological and apocalyptic setting of a Last Judgement is in precise contrast to the ''Titanomachia'' of Hesiod which serves its distinct service to Greek mythology as its ''Prolegomenon'', bracketing all subsequent mythology, including the creation of humanity, as coming after the cosmological struggle between the Titans and the Olympian gods.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIt remains a continuing debate among scholars of comparative religion and the literary reception<ref>Dostoevski, Fyodor. ''The Brothers Karamazov'', chapter on \"The Grand Inquisitor\".</ref> of mythological and religious subject matter as to whether the typology of suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth finds its more representative comparisons with the narratives of the Hebrew scriptures or with the New Testament narratives. In the [[Book of Job]], significant comparisons can be drawn between the sustained suffering of Job in comparison to that of eternal suffering and torment represented in the Prometheus myth. With Job, the suffering is at the acquiescence of heaven and at the will of the demonic, while in Prometheus the suffering is directly linked to Zeus as the ruler of Olympus. The comparison of the suffering of Jesus after his sentencing in Jerusalem is limited to the three days, from Thursday to Saturday, and leading to the culminating narratives corresponding to Easter Sunday. The symbolic import for comparative religion would maintain that suffering related to justified conduct is redeemed in both the Hebrew scriptures and the New Testament narratives, while in Prometheus there remains the image of a non-forgiving deity, Zeus, who nonetheless requires reverence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nWriting in [[late antiquity]] of the fourth and fifth century, the Latin commentator Marcus [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] Honoratus explained that Prometheus was so named because he was a man of great foresight ''(vir prudentissimus)'', possessing the abstract quality of ''[[providentia]]'', the Latin equivalent of Greek ''prom\u0113theia'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}).<ref>[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], note to [[Vergil]]'s ''[[Eclogue]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Serv.+Ecl.+6.42&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0091 6.42]: ''Prometheus vir prudentissimus fuit, unde etiam Prometheus dictus est'' {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2}}'', id est a providentia''.</ref> Anecdotally, the Roman [[fabulist]] [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (c.15 BC \u2013 c.50 AD) attributes to [[Aesop]] a simple [[etiology]] for [[homosexuality]], in Prometheus' getting drunk while creating the first humans and misapplying the genitalia.<ref name=\"Dionysos\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DionysosMyths2.html#Fable |title=Dionysos |publisher=Theoi.com |accessdate=2012-05-18}}</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\nPerhaps the most influential book of the Middle Ages upon the reception of the Prometheus myth was the mythological handbook of Fulgentius Placiades. As stated by [[Olga Raggio|Raggio]],{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=53}} \"The text of Fulgentius, as well as that of (Marcus) Servius [...] are the main sources of the mythological handbooks written in the ninth century by the anonymous ''Mythographus Primus'' and ''Mythographus Secundus''. Both were used for the more lengthy and elaborate compendium by the English scholar [[Alexander Neckam|Alexander Neckman]] (1157\u20131217), the ''Scintillarium Poetarum'', or ''Poetarius''.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=53}} The purpose of his books was to distinguish allegorical interpretation from the historical interpretation of the Prometheus myth. Continuing in this same tradition of the allegorical interpretation of the Prometheus myth, along with the historical interpretation of the Middle Ages, is the ''[[Genealogia Deorum Gentilium|Genealogiae]]'' of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]. Boccaccio follows these two levels of interpretation and distinguishes between two separate versions of the Prometheus myth. For Boccaccio, Prometheus is placed \"In the heavens where all is clarity and truth, [Prometheus] steals, so to speak, a ray of the divine wisdom from God himself, source of all Science, supreme Light of every man.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=54}} With this, Boccaccio shows himself moving from the mediaeval sources with a shift of accent towards the attitude of the Renaissance humanists.\n\nUsing a similar interpretation to that of Boccaccio, [[Marsilio Ficino]] in the fifteenth century updated the philosophical and more sombre reception of the Prometheus myth not seen since the time of [[Plotinus]]. In his book written in 1476\u201377 titled ''Quaestiones Quinque de Mente'', Ficino indicates his preference for reading the Prometheus myth as an image of the human soul seeking to obtain supreme truth. As [[Olga Raggio]] summarises Ficino's text, \"The torture of Prometheus is the torment brought by reason itself to man, who is made by it many times more unhappy than the brutes. It is after having stolen one beam of the celestial light [...] that the soul feels as if fastened by chains and [...] only death can release her bonds and carry her to the source of all knowledge.\"{{sfnp|Raggio|1958|p=54}} This sombreness of attitude in Ficino's text would be further developed later by [[Charles de Bouelles]]' ''Liber de Sapiente'' of 1509 which presented a mix of both scholastic and [[Neoplatonic]] ideas.\n\n==Renaissance==\n[[File:Piero di cosimo, prometeo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Mythological narrative of Prometheus by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (1515)]]\nAfter the writings of both Boccaccio and Ficino in the late Middle Ages about Prometheus, interest in the Titan shifted considerably in the direction of becoming subject matter for painters and sculptors alike. Among the most famous examples is that of [[Piero di Cosimo]] from about 1510 presently on display at the museums of Munich and Strasburg (see Inset). Raggio summarises the Munich version<ref>Munich, ''Alte Pinakothek'', Katalog, 1930, no. 8973. Strasburg, ''Musee des Beaux Arts'', Catalog, 1932, no. 225.</ref> as follows; \"The Munich panel represents the dispute between Epimetheus and Prometheus, the handsome triumphant statue of the new man, modelled by Prometheus, his ascension to the sky under the guidance of Minerva; the Strasburg panel shows in the distance Prometheus lighting his torch at the wheels of the Sun, and in the foreground on one side, Prometheus applying his torch to the heart of the statue and, on the other, Mercury fastening him to a tree.\" All the details are evidently borrowed from [[Boccaccio]]'s ''Genealogiae''.\n\nThe same reference to the ''Genealogiae'' can be cited as the source for the drawing by [[Parmigianino]] presently located in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City.<ref>''Parmigianino: The Drawings'', Sylvie Beguin et al. {{ISBN|88-422-1020-X}}.</ref> In the drawing, a very noble rendering of Prometheus is presented which evokes the memory of Michelangelo's works portraying Jehovah. This drawing is perhaps one of the most intense examples of the visualisation of the myth of Prometheus from the Renaissance period.\n\nWriting in the late British Renaissance, William Shakespeare uses the Promethean allusion in the famous death scene of Desdemona in his tragedy of ''Othello''. Othello in contemplating the death of Desdemona asserts plainly that he cannot restore the \"Promethean heat\" to her body once it has been extinguished. For Shakespeare, the allusion is clearly to the interpretation of the fire from the heat as the bestowing of life to the creation of man from clay by Prometheus after it was stolen from Olympus. The analogy bears direct resemblance to the biblical narrative of the creation of life in Adam through the bestowed breathing of the creator in Genesis. Shakespeare's symbolic reference to the \"heat\" associated with Prometheus' fire is to the association of the gift of fire to the mythological gift or theological gift of life to humans.\n\n==Post-Renaissance==\n[[File:Thomas Cole - Prometheus Bound - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Prometheus Bound (Thomas Cole)|Prometheus Bound]]'' by Thomas Cole (1847)]]\n{{See also|Prometheus in popular culture}}\nThe myth of Prometheus has been a favourite theme of [[Western art]] and literature in the post-[[renaissance]] and post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] tradition and, occasionally, in works produced outside the [[Western civilisation|West]].\n\n=== Post-Renaissance literary arts ===\nFor the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], Prometheus was the rebel who resisted all forms of institutional tyranny epitomised by Zeus \u2013 church, monarch, and patriarch. The Romantics drew comparisons between Prometheus and the spirit of the [[French Revolution]], [[Christ]], the [[Satan]] of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and the divinely inspired poet or artist. Prometheus is the lyrical \"I\" who speaks in [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' poem [[Prometheus (Goethe)|\"Prometheus\"]] (written c. 1772\u201374, published 1789), addressing God (as Zeus) in [[misotheist]] accusation and defiance. In ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820), a four-act lyrical drama, [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] rewrites the lost play of Aeschylus so that Prometheus does not submit to Zeus (under the Latin name Jupiter), but instead supplants him in a triumph of the human heart and intellect over tyrannical religion. [[Lord Byron]]'s poem \"Prometheus\" also portrays the Titan as unrepentant. As documented by Olga Raggio, other leading figures among the great Romantics included Byron, Longfellow and Nietzsche as well.<ref name=\"Raggio\" /> [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' is subtitled \"The Modern Prometheus\", in reference to the novel's themes of the over-reaching of modern humanity into dangerous areas of knowledge.\n\n====Goethe's poems====\n{{Listen|type=speech|image=none|filename=De-Prometheus Gedicht-wikisource.ogg|title=\"Prometheus\"|description=spoken {{in lang|de}}<br />(2:06 minutes, 1 [[Megabyte|MB]])}}\n''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]'' is a poem by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], in which a character based on the mythic Prometheus addresses God (as [[Zeus]]) in a romantic and [[Misotheism|misotheist]] tone of accusation and defiance. The poem was written between 1772 and 1774. It was first published fifteen years later in 1789. It is an important work as it represents one of the first encounters of the Prometheus myth with the literary Romantic movement identified with Goethe and with the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement.\n\nThe poem has appeared in Volume 6 of Goethe's poems (in his Collected Works) in a section of ''{{Lang|de|Vermischte Gedichte}}'' (assorted poems), shortly following the ''[[Harzreise im Winter]]''. It is immediately followed by [[Ganymed (Goethe)|\"Ganymed\"]], and the two poems are written as informing each other according to Goethe's plan in their actual writing. ''Prometheus'' (1774) was originally planned as a drama but never completed by Goethe, though the poem is inspired by it. Prometheus is the creative and rebellious spirit rejected by God and who angrily defies him and asserts himself. [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], by direct contrast, is the boyish self who is both adored and seduced by God. As a high Romantic poet and a humanist poet, Goethe presents both identities as contrasting aspects of the Romantic human condition.\n\nThe poem offers direct biblical connotations for the Prometheus myth which was unseen in any of the ancient Greek poets dealing with the Prometheus myth in either drama, tragedy, or philosophy. The intentional use of the German phrase \"{{Lang|de|Da ich ein Kind war...}}\" (\"When I was a child\"): the use of ''{{Lang|de|Da}}'' is distinctive, and with it Goethe directly applies the [[Martin Luther|Lutheran]] translation of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]'s [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], [[s:Bible (King James)/1 Corinthians#13:11|13:11]]: \"{{Lang|de|Da ich ein Kind war, da redete ich wie ein Kind...}}\" (\"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things\"). Goethe's Prometheus is significant for the contrast it evokes with the biblical text of the Corinthians rather than for its similarities.\n\nIn his book titled ''Prometheus: Archetypal Image of Human Existence'', C. Ker\u00e9nyi states the key contrast between Goethe's version of Prometheus with the ancient Greek version.{{sfnp|Ker\u00e9nyi|1997|p=11}} As Ker\u00e9nyi states, \"Goethe's Prometheus had Zeus for father and a goddess for mother. With this change from the traditional lineage the poet distinguished his hero from the race of the Titans.\" For Goethe, the metaphorical comparison of Prometheus to the image of the Son from the New Testament narratives was of central importance, with the figure of Zeus in Goethe's reading being metaphorically matched directly to the image of the Father from the New Testament narratives.\n\n====Percy Bysshe Shelley====\n[[Percy Shelley]] published his four-act lyrical drama titled ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' in 1820. His version was written in response to the version of myth as presented by Aeschylus and is orientated to the high British Idealism and high British Romanticism prevailing in Shelley's own time. Shelley, as the author himself discusses, admits the debt of his version of the myth to [[Aeschylus]] and the Greek poetic tradition which he assumes is familiar to readers of his own lyrical drama. For example, it is necessary to understand and have knowledge of the reason for Prometheus' punishment if the reader is to form an understanding of whether the exoneration portrayed by Shelley in his version of the Prometheus myth is justified or unjustified. The quote of Shelley's own words describing the extent of his indebtedness to Aeschylus has been published in numerous sources publicly available.\n\nThe literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] in his book ''Shelley's Mythmaking'' expresses his high expectation of Shelley in the tradition of mythopoeic poetry. For Bloom, Percy Shelley's relationship to the tradition of mythology in poetry \"culminates in 'Prometheus'. The poem provides a complete statement of Shelley's vision.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold (1959). ''Shelley's Mythmaking,'' Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, p. 9.</ref> Bloom devotes two full chapters in this book to Shelley's lyrical drama ''Prometheus Unbound'' which was among the first books Bloom had ever written, originally published in 1959.<ref>Bloom (1959), Chapter 3.</ref> Following his 1959 book, Bloom edited an anthology of critical opinions on Shelley for Chelsea House Publishers where he concisely stated his opinion as, \"Shelley is the unacknowledged ancestor of Wallace Stevens' conception of poetry as the Supreme Fiction, and ''Prometheus Unbound'' is the most capable imagining, outside of Blake and Wordsworth, that the Romantic quest for a Supreme Fiction has achieved.\"<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p.8. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref>\n\nWithin the pages of his Introduction to the Chelsea House edition on Percy Shelley, Harold Bloom also identifies the six major schools of criticism opposing Shelley's idealised mythologising version of the Prometheus myth. In sequence, the opposing schools to Shelley are given as: (i) The school of \"common sense\", (ii) The Christian orthodox, (iii) The school of \"wit\", (iv) Moralists, of most varieties, (v) The school of \"classic\" form, and (vi) The Precisionists, or concretists.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p. 27. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref> Although Bloom is least interested in the first two schools, the second one on the Christian orthodox has special bearing on the reception of the Prometheus myth during late Roman antiquity and the synthesis of the New Testament canon. The Greek origins of the Prometheus myth have already discussed the ''Titanomachia'' as placing the cosmic struggle of Olympus at some point in time preceding the creation of humanity, while in the New Testament synthesis there was a strong assimilation of the prophetic tradition of the Hebrew prophets and their strongly eschatological orientation. This contrast placed a strong emphasis within the ancient Greek consciousness as to the moral and ontological acceptance of the mythology of the ''Titanomachia'' as an accomplished mythological history, whereas for the synthesis of the New Testament narratives this placed religious consciousness within the community at the level of an anticipated ''eschaton'' not yet accomplished. Neither of these would guide Percy Shelley in his poetic retelling and re-integration of the Prometheus myth.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1959). ''Shelley's Mythmaking,'' Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut, p. 29.</ref>\n\nTo the Socratic Greeks, one important aspect of the discussion of religion would correspond to the philosophical discussion of 'becoming' with respect to the New Testament syncretism rather than the ontological discussion of 'being' which was more prominent in the ancient Greek experience of mythologically oriented cult and religion.<ref>Heidegger, Martin. ''Being and Time.''</ref> For Percy Shelley, both of these reading were to be substantially discounted in preference to his own concerns for promoting his own version of an idealised consciousness of a society guided by the precepts of High British Romanticism and High British Idealism.<ref>Bloom, Harold (1985). ''Percy Bysshe Shelley''. Modern Critical Editions, p. 28. Chelsea House Publishers, New York.</ref>\n\n====''Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus''====\n''[[Frankenstein|Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus]]'', written by Mary Shelley when she was 18, was published in 1818, two years before Percy Shelley's above-mentioned play. It has endured as one of the most frequently revisited literary themes in twentieth century film and popular reception with few rivals for its sheer popularity among even established literary works of art. The primary theme is a parallel to the aspect of the Prometheus myth which concentrates on the creation of man by the Titans, transferred and made contemporary by Shelley for British audiences of her time. The subject is that of the creation of life by a scientist, thus bestowing life through the application and technology of medical science rather than by the natural acts of reproduction. The short novel has been adapted into many films and productions ranging from the early versions with [[Boris Karloff]] to later versions featuring [[Kenneth Branagh]].\n\n====Twentieth century====\n[[File:Otto Greiner - Prometheus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Prometheus'' (1909) by [[Otto Greiner]]]]\n[[Franz Kafka]] wrote a short piece titled \"[[Prometheus (short story)|Prometheus]],\" outlining what he saw as his perspective on four aspects of his myth:\n<blockquote>''According to the first, he was clamped to a rock in the Caucasus for betraying the secrets of the gods to men, and the gods sent eagles to feed on his liver, which was perpetually renewed.<br> According to the second, Prometheus, goaded by the pain of the tearing beaks, pressed himself deeper and deeper into the rock until he became one with it.<br> According to the third, his treachery was forgotten in the course of thousands of years, forgotten by the gods, the eagles, forgotten by himself.<br> According to the fourth, everyone grew weary of the meaningless affair. The gods grew weary, the eagles grew weary, the wound closed wearily.<br>There remains the inexplicable mass of rock. The legend tried to explain the inexplicable.

See Glatzer, Nahum N., ed. \"Franz Kafka: The Complete Stories\" Schocken Book, Inc.: New York, 1971.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis short piece by Kafka concerning his interest in Prometheus was supplemented by two other mythological pieces written by him. As stated by Reiner Stach, \"Kafka's world was mythical in nature, with Old Testament and Jewish legends providing the templates. It was only logical (even if Kafka did not state it openly) that he would try his hand at the canon of antiquity, re-interpreting it and incorporating it into his own imagination in the form of allusions, as in 'The Silence of the Sirens,' 'Prometheus,' and 'Poseidon.'\"<ref>Stach, Reiner (3013). ''Kafka: The years of Insight'', Princeton University Press, English translation.</ref> Among contemporary poets, the British poet [[Ted Hughes]] wrote a 1973 collection of poems titled ''Prometheus on His Crag''. The [[Nepal]]i poet [[Laxmi Prasad Devkota]] (d. 1949) also wrote an epic titled ''Prometheus'' (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0940\u0925\u0938).\n\nIn his 1952 book, ''[[Lucifer and Prometheus]]'', [[R.J. Zwi Werblowsky|Zvi Werblowsky]] presented the speculatively derived Jungian construction of the character of Satan in Milton's celebrated poem ''Paradise Lost''. Werblowsky applied his own Jungian style of interpretation to appropriate parts of the Prometheus myth for the purpose of interpreting Milton. A reprint of his book in the 1990s by Routledge Press included an introduction to the book by Carl Jung.
