In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is produced by [[BBC]]. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''Master Chef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver, with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9 to 12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format and style of the show has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final. They then would compete for the title of ''Master Chef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, and they could bring up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants, and finally, ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the program asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant had to use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA|Master Chef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone being that Rhodes' advice to contestants was more critical than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''. The name reverted to ''MasterChef'' in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/tv_and_radio/masterchef/ |title=Two Programmes \u2013 MasterChef \u2013 Previous episodes |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the new version, there are two permanent judges, [[John Torode]] and [[Gregg Wallace]], although they do not address the viewer's directly; instead, narrative information is conveyed in a voice over by [[India Fisher]].\n\nThe show proved very popular and became one of [[BBC Two]]'s more successful early-evening programs, leading to an announcement by the BBC in 2009 that it would be moved to [[BBC One]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/03_march/13/masterchef.shtml |title=Press Office \u2013 MasterChef rustles up move to BBC One |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-03-13}}</ref>\n\n===Format===\n[[File:Wallace and Torode.jpg|right|thumb|Judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace at ''MasterChef Live'', London, 2009]]\nIn the new format, each series airs five nights a week for eight weeks, consisting of six weeks of heats and quarter-finals, with six contestants emerging to compete against one another over the final two weeks to select a winner.\n\nIn each of the first six weeks, there are four heats and a quarter-final. Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''Master Chef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''Master Chef Live''==\n''Master Chef Live'' is an extension of the television program. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theater, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity Master Chef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity Master Chef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.

She had attempted to make a dish in thirty minutes that normally takes several hours to cook. Wallace pointed out that she should have tried to make a crispy chicken dish, given the time she had available. Many commentators (who did not realize what the competition was about), particularly from Malaysia and Indonesia, pointed out that rendang is usually cooked as a stew and is not crispy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=France-Presse|first1=Agence|title='I would rendang his head': UK MasterChef judges stir up a storm|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/apr/03/i-would-rendang-his-head-uk-masterchef-judges-stir-up-a-storm|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 April 2018}}</ref> The judges failed to differentiate between \"crispy\" and \"under cooked\".

a competitive cooking show produced by [[Endemol Shine Group]] and is broadcasted in 60 countries around the world. In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], it is produced by [[BBC]]. The show initially ran between 1990 and 2001 and was later revived in a different format known as '''''Master Chef Goes Large''''' from 2005 onwards. In 2008, the \"Goes Large\" part of the name was dropped, but the format remains identical. The revamped format was devised by [[Franc Roddam]] and John Silver, with Karen Ross producing.\n\nThe series now appears in four versions: the main ''MasterChef'' series, ''[[MasterChef: The Professionals]]'' for working chefs, ''Celebrity MasterChef'' and ''[[Junior MasterChef]]'' for 9 to 12-year-olds.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/08_august/24/junior.shtml |title=CBBC gets children cooking as Junior MasterChef is announced |date=24 August 2009}}</ref> The format and style of the show has been reproduced around the world in various [[MasterChef|international versions]].\n\n==Original series==\nIn the original series, three amateur cooks took part in each episode, with nine rounds leading up to three semifinals and a final. They then would compete for the title of ''Master Chef''. The contestants were required to cook a gourmet three-course meal in under two hours. Contestants could cook any recipe, although there was a price limit on ingredients. \"Everyday\" ingredients and equipment were provided for them, and they could bring up to five \"specialist\" ingredients or utensils.\n\nThe first incarnation of the series was presented by [[Loyd Grossman]], who was joined each week by two guest judges. One was a professional chef, the other was a celebrity. Grossman and the guest judges discussed the menus, walked around talking to the contestants, and finally, ate and judged the food. Originally, the judges' \"cogitations\" took place off-camera, though later on, edited highlights of the discussions were added between the tasting and the announcement of the winner.\n\nIn 1998 Grossman decided to take a [[sabbatical]], and the series was placed on hiatus in his absence.{{cn|date=October 2018}} He returned to present the 1999 series, but left the show in 2000.\n\n===Grossman's departure and 2001 revamp===\nIn 2001, in response to declining ratings, the show underwent a makeover. It was moved from its traditional Sunday afternoon slot on [[BBC One]] to a Tuesday night slot on [[BBC Two]]. This new version of the program asked contestants to cook two courses in just 90 minutes, and each contestant had to use the same key ingredient in each course \u2014 this was extended to two-and-a-half hours for three courses in the final. The celebrity judge was no longer included in this version.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|title=Masterchef - UKGameshows|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173955/http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Masterchef|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn October 2000, Grossman quit in anger over the proposed changes and he was replaced by chef [[Gary Rhodes]], who had previously presented ''[[MasterChef USA|Master Chef USA]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} ENTERTAINMENT {{!}} Grossman quits Masterchef|last=|first=|date=17 October 2000|website=BBC News Online|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202162125/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/976107.stm|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> The new version of the show received acclaim for its more serious tone being that Rhodes' advice to contestants was more critical than Grossman's, a forerunner of the approach of future cooking competitions like ''[[Hell's Kitchen (British TV series)|Hell's Kitchen]]'' and the new format of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|title=The repast master - Telegraph|last=Symington|first=Nicki|date=7 July 2001|website=The Telegraph|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202164127/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/3290216/The-repast-master.html|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|title=Between courses... {{!}} Food {{!}} The Guardian|last=Rayner|first=Jay|date=8 September 2002|website=The Guardian|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191202173735/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/sep/08/foodanddrink.restaurants|archive-date=2 December 2019|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref> However, it did not revive ratings as hoped, and was cancelled by the BBC after the first series.\n\n==Revived series==\nIn 2005, executive producers Franc Roddam and John Silver, along with series producer Karen Ross radically overhauled the format, and a new series was introduced, initially under the name ''MasterChef Goes Large''.

Six contestants enter each heat, with one quarter-finalist emerging from each of the four heats. These four quarter-finalists compete for a semi-final place, so that over the first six weeks, six semi-finalists emerge.\n\nIn 2010, the judges were given more flexibility, allowing them to advance more than one contestant to the quarter-finals, or, in one instance, none at all. Series 7 of ''Master Chef'' featured 'talent show-type' audition shows (similar to ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'') in which hopeful chefs cooked in front of the judges to secure a place in the competition. More than 20,000 people applied to audition for the series.<ref>{{cite news|author=BBC |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8332394/MasterChef-revamp-has-turned-cooking-show-into-The-X-Factor.html |title=MasterChef revamp 'has turned cooking show into The X Factor' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 18 February 2011|accessdate=2011-10-22 |location=London}}</ref>\n\n====Heats====\nThe heats follow a three-round format:\n* ''The Market Test'': the contestants have to invent a dish with the ingredients from the market, they have 15 minutes to select the food and 1 hour 10 minutes to cook the dish. 3 people leave the competition with the remaining going to the impression test from 2017\n* ''The Calling Card'': the contestants must invent a dish from scratch in 75 minutes (40 minutes up until 2009). The contestants can choose from any ingredients they like. \n* ''The Invention Test'': the contestants are given two boxes, one with sweet items, another with savoury. They must pick a box and make a dish out of the ingredients within 75 minutes.\n* ''The Impression Test'': the contestants must cook a two course meal in 75 minutes for past winners and finalists of ''MasterChef''. 1 hour to serve the main course, and a further fifteen minutes after that to serve dessert.\n\n====Quarter-finals====\nThe quarter-finals follow a different structure with different challenges. Up until 2010, the format was:\n* ''The Ingredients Test'': where the contestants are asked to identify a selection of ingredients or produce.\n* ''The Passion Test'': in which each contestant has one minute to convince the judges of their overwhelming passion for food. Following these two rounds, one contestant is knocked out without having cooked that day.\n* Finally, the remaining three quarter-finalists each produce a three course meal in one hour and twenty minutes.\n\nIn 2010, the quarter-final format was changed to:\n* ''The Choice Test'': where the contestants are given 15 minutes to cook their choice of either a pre-selected fish recipe or a meat recipe with the judges looking on. At least one contestant is eliminated after this test.\n* This is followed by the remaining quarter-finalists producing a two course meal in an hour.\n\nNow, the quarter-final format is: \n* ''The Palate Test'': Torode cooks a dish for the contestants, and they must identify the ingredients and try to recreate the dish using the ingredients given. \n* ''The Choice Test'': the chefs have 80 minutes to create a showstopping dish for the judges and a special celebrity food critic\n\n====Comeback Week====\nThe sixth week was called \"Comeback Week\" and featured contestants from the previous series of ''MasterChef'', who did not advance past the heats or quarter-finals. The format was different for this week:\n* ''The Skill Test'': where the contestants have 25 minutes to cook one of two pre-selected recipes. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Palate Test'': where Torode cooks a complex dish and asks the contestants one by one to eat the dish, listing as many ingredients in the dish as possible. Some contestants may be eliminated after this test.\n* ''The Pressure Test'': where the remaining contestants work a lunchtime shift at a busy restaurant under the supervision of a professional chef who comments on their performance.\n* The remaining contestants then have 60 minutes to cook a two course meal. One contestant is selected to advance to a quarter-final.\n* The comeback quarter-finalists then cook head-to-head in a larger version of the invention test, cooking one dish in an hour. One contestant is selected to advance to the semi-finals.\n\n==''Master Chef Live''==\n''Master Chef Live'' is an extension of the television program. The event runs annually in November and is held over three days since 2009; it is hosted at [[Olympia (London)|London Olympia]], co-located with the annual [http://www.wineshow.co.uk/ Wine Show].\n\nHighlights of the event include live cooking demonstrations in the Chefs\u2019 Theater, celebrity chefs, former contestants, critics, and ''MasterChef'' style cook-offs.\n\n== ''Celebrity Master Chef'' ==\n{{redirect|Celebrity MasterChef|the Romanian series|Celebrity MasterChef (Romanian series)}}\n''Celebrity Master Chef'' was devised as a celebrity version of ''Master Chef Goes Large''.

In 1999, he was the producer for the CBC of the special H\u00f6rspiel broadcast from 10 to 12 PM on the night of December 31 for the passage to the new millennium. Another H\u00f6rspeil, \"Standard III\" (2002), was commissioned by the CBC and broadcast on the night of Easter Sunday in 2003 under a program developed and curated by [[Mario Gauthier]] and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pr\u00e9vost]].<ref>Gauthier, Mario, Standard III (ou un silence en cache-t-il un autre?), Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (Web site and Radio Program), Montreal, Quebec, Canada, 2002 (http://www.radio-canada.ca/radio/navire/texte-pdf/standard3.gauthier.pdf)</ref> He received several grants and awards including grants from the Artists and Community Collaboration Program (ACCP), the Inter-Arts Program of the [[Canada Council for the Arts]] and from the [[Conseil des arts et des lettres du Qu\u00e9bec]] for his artistic and curatorial work.<ref>[https://canadacouncil.ca/-/media/Files/CCA/Research/2014/10/03/2008-2009/2008-09-QCEN.pdf?la=en Canada Council for the Arts Funding to artists and arts organizations in Quebec, 2008-09] </ref><ref>[https://canadacouncil.ca/-/media/Files/CCA/Research/2014/10/03/2007-2008/2007-08-QCEN.pdf?la=en Canada Council for the Arts Funding to artists and arts organizations in Quebec, 2007-08]Canada Council for the Arts / Conseil des Arts du Canada.</ref><ref>[https://canadacouncil.ca/-/media/Files/CCA/Research/2014/10/03/2006-2007/2006-07-QCEN.pdf?la=en Canada Council for the Arts Funding to artists and arts organizations in Quebec, 2006-07]</ref>\n\n==Experimental music and radio-art==\n\nAs a music composer and radio artist, L\u00e9tourneau's works are influenced by the principle of [[indeterminacy in music]], [[chance music]], [[intuitive music]], [[noise music]], [[sound poetry]], [[text-sound composition]], [[spectral music]], non-standard use of musical instruments, traditional music from different cultures (especially [[Balinese gamelan]]), by the use of different systems of tuning involving the use of [[microtones]]  which incorporate [[electronics]] and [[extended techniques]]. He also regularly constructs his own instruments and custom-built electronics.\n\nHe qualifies most of his works as [[site-specific (disambiguation)|site-specific]] (pieces to be performed or installed in a precise place) but also \"time-specific\" (pieces to be performed at specific time of the day or of the year).<ref>Lander, Dan, A Selected survey or Radio Art in Canada 1967-1992, Walter Phillips Gallery, Banff Center for the Arts, 1992</ref> Since 1999, L\u00e9tourneau has also involved himself with music composition and interpretation and as the creator of custom-made instruments which are used in his work with the sound performance trio [[mineminemine]] along with intermedia artists [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]]. The group regularly presents mineminemine's work in America and Europe.\n\nSince the mid-eighties, L\u00e9tourneau has also performed works from other experimental music composers such as [[Alvin Lucier]], [[John Cage]] and [[I Wayan Suweca]]. In 2000, he conducted a radio performance of the Symphony No. 5 by the Korean composer [[Nam June Paik]] for the CBC radio.\n\nAs a musician, he has collaborated with other composers including Sam Shalabi (Shalabi Effect), Roger Tellier Craig ([[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]], Et Sans), [[Jo\u00eblle L\u00e9andre]], [[Jac Berrocal]], [[John Berndt]], [[Phill Niblock]], Alexander MacSween, [[Michel Smith]] (Orchestre V\u00e9lo Karel), [[Helena Espvall]], Jackie Blake, Dan Breen, Neil Wiernik (a.k.a. NAW) and [[R\u00e9jean Beaucage]]. He produced the score for the immersive film installation \"Rouge M\u00e9kong\" by Fran\u00e7ois-Lavoie Pilote, presented in Montreal at la [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des arts technologiques]] in 2013 and 2014.\n\nAs an executive producer for the CBC radio, CKUT-FM and wikiradio.uqam.ca, L\u00e9tourneau also produced concert recordings of musicians and performance artists such as [[Kathy Kennedy]], [[Anna Friz]], [[Richard H. Kirk]], [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]], [[Thomas Buckner]], [[Johanne H\u00e9tu]], [[Brandon Labelle]], [[Christof Migone]], [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]],  [[Fred Frith]], [[Chris Cutler]], [[Serge Pey]], [[Sam Shalabi]], [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]], Roger Tellier-Craig and [[Joachim Montessuis]].\n\n==Art (manoeuvers, site-specific actions, contextual art and transmedia works)==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau's art manoeuvers work involves many media that are used simultaneously along with practices from other fields (such as science, sociology, psychology, community works, etc.). It may be difficult to categorize his work as much as of the practice by this artist involves operating directly within the social fabric while involving different social and ontological phenomena. L\u00e9tourneau works primarily with the creation of situations based on cultural and physical environmental processes. His actions are often structured so as to avoid the creation of objects or material products. These traces in reality are primarily works where the confusion between art and life emerges as the salient feature. While operating within different institutions, the works of L\u00e9tourneau often raise the concepts of power and consensus within the community.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau adapts his materials and methods of production according to the environmental requirements of each  project.<ref>Pelletier, Sonia,  Ondes fluides et points de forces, in. Inter #55, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1993</ref> For example, the use of correspondences, legal agreements, CD publishing and radio broadcasts in his 2005 piece \"Standard III\". L\u00e9tourneau also used other media such as integration of sign language and lip readings in various popular productions for television and Hollywood Cinema in \"Biblical Consequences of the Representations\" (2007\u20132010); photography, psychogeographic factors and individual conversations in \"Standard II\" (2001\u2013present); radioactive material process in a particle accelerator at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], aircraft and video in 1997's \"3 9 30,\";<ref>Martel, Richard, L'art en actes, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, 1998</ref> anagrams and floating custom built sound modules in \"Sonata for the Wolf\" from 2001. \"L\u00e9tourneau is calling upon the structures that have and do produce us, our notions of nationality and  belonging, and he is using the self same tools that gave rise to our present day status\".<ref>Spencer, Karen, Deflecting the Standard, in.

These works were presented in collaboration with different NGO's, community groups and human rights associations in Canada.\n\nSince October 2001, the artistic work of \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau has been centered around a series of meeting-maneuvers with citizens around the world. These maneuvers take place in the United States, Canada, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan, Italy, Germany and France.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accra-recherche.unistra.fr/laccra/membres/doctorants/eric-letourneau/|title=Eric Letourneau - Approches contemporaines de la cr\u00e9ation et de la r\u00e9flexion artistiques - ACCRA - Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg|website=accra-recherche.unistra.fr|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n\n==Collaborations==\n\nAndr\u00e9 \u00c9ric L\u00e9tourneau collaborated frequently with worked with many performance artists to create performances, video and installations, among them [[Jean Dupuy (artist)|Jean Dupuy]] (a French artist associated with the [[Fluxus]] group), [[John Berndt]], [[Christof Migone]],<ref>Gingras, Nicole  and Migone, Christof, Trou, Galerie de l'Uqam, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, 2006 ({{ISBN|2-920325-38-8}})</ref> [[Jocelyn Robert]], [[Beno\u00eet Fauteux]], [[Arahmaiani]], the Chinese performance artist [[Zhu Yu (artist)|Zhu Yu]] and the Estonian group [[Non Grata]].\n\n===Mineminemine===\nMineminemine is an eclectic [[experimental music]] and [[performance art]] group he started along with [[Magali Babin]] and [[Alexandre Saint-Onge]].

It may be difficult to categorize his work as much as of the practice by this artist involves operating directly within the social fabric while involving different social and ontological phenomena. L\u00e9tourneau works primarily with the creation of situations based on cultural and physical environmental processes. His actions are often structured so as to avoid the creation of objects or material products. These traces in reality are primarily works where the confusion between art and life emerges as the salient feature. While operating within different institutions, the works of L\u00e9tourneau often raise the concepts of power and consensus within the community.\n\nL\u00e9tourneau adapts his materials and methods of production according to the environmental requirements of each  project.<ref>Pelletier, Sonia,  Ondes fluides et points de forces, in. Inter #55, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, 1993</ref> For example, the use of correspondences, legal agreements, CD publishing and radio broadcasts in his 2005 piece \"Standard III\". L\u00e9tourneau also used other media such as integration of sign language and lip readings in various popular productions for television and Hollywood Cinema in \"Biblical Consequences of the Representations\" (2007\u20132010); photography, psychogeographic factors and individual conversations in \"Standard II\" (2001\u2013present); radioactive material process in a particle accelerator at the [[Universit\u00e9 Laval]], aircraft and video in 1997's \"3 9 30,\";<ref>Martel, Richard, L'art en actes, \u00c9ditions Interventions, Qu\u00e9bec, 1998</ref> anagrams and floating custom built sound modules in \"Sonata for the Wolf\" from 2001. \"L\u00e9tourneau is calling upon the structures that have and do produce us, our notions of nationality and  belonging, and he is using the self same tools that gave rise to our present day status\".<ref>Spencer, Karen, Deflecting the Standard, in.

According to Wilson:\n{{quote|\"I was going with a girl called Judy Bowles, and her brother Jimmy was a surfer. He knew all the surfing spots. I started humming the melody to 'Sweet Little Sixteen' and I got fascinated with the fact of doing it, and I thought to myself, 'God! What about trying to put surf lyrics to 'Sweet Little Sixteen's melody? The concept was about, 'They are doing this in this city, and they're doing that in that city' So I said to Jimmy, 'Hey Jimmy, I want to do a song mentioning all the surf spots.' So he gave me a list.\"<ref>Badman, Keith.

Later releases, beginning with ''[[Best of The Beach Boys]]'' in 1966, listed Chuck Berry as the songwriter. Later releases list both writers although the copyright has always been owned, since 1963, by Arc Music. Under pressure from Berry's publisher, Wilson's father and manager, [[Murry Wilson]], had given the copyright, including Brian Wilson's lyrics, to Arc Music prior to the release of the single.<ref>Pegg, Bruce.

The song peaked on the ''Billboard'' pop chart at number three, the band's first top ten hit therein (see also ''Surfin' Safari''). The B-side charted at number 23. Although the double-sided hit single registered in ''Billboard'' as number one in chart points at the end of the year (tabulated up to mid November 1963) and was cited by ''Billboard'' as \"best-selling record of the year\", in a low-selling year for singles in the US it apparently did not initially sell a million copies\u2014and has never been issued an [[RIAA certification|RIAA Gold Disc award]]. The song was re-issued in the U.S. as a single in July 1974 backed with \"[[The Warmth of the Sun]]\". That single also hit the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, peaking at 36.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was released in June 1963. The third single by the band to be issued in the UK, it became the first single to chart. It would go on to peak at 34 (28 in the ''[[New Musical Express]]'').\n\nIn Australia, the single was released in 1963 and peaked at 9, becoming the band's first single to chart in Australia. The single was re-released in Australia in 1974 and again charted, peaking at 66. In Canada and Sweden, the single was released in 1963 and peaked on the charts at 6 in both countries. In July 1963, in the national charts used by ''Billboard'', it peaked at #9 in Hong Kong, #8 in Austria the following month; in August 1964 at #9 for two weeks in Japan.\n\n===Charts===\n;The Beach Boys\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1963)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart<ref name=\"Canadian Singles Charts\">{{cite web | title=Canadian Singles Charts | publisher=mountvernonandfairway.de | url=http://www.mountvernonandfairway.de/charts8.htm | access-date=12 November 2007 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310033408/http://www.mountvernonandfairway.de/charts8.htm | archive-date=10 March 2007 | df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qsongid=902#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 20 June 1963]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n!Chart (1974)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66\n|}\n;Leif Garrett\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1977)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany|6|artist=Leif Garrett|song=Surfin USA}}\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5411&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5411.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5411|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1977-10-01 |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|48\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles<ref name=\"govofcanada\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5447a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5447a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5447a|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1977-10-29 |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19771022.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, , 1977]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|29\n|-\n|}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n;The Beach Boys\n* [[Mike Love]] \u2013 [[lead vocal]]\n* [[David Marks]] \u2013 rhythm guitar\n* [[Brian Wilson]] \u2013 [[bass guitar]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]]\n* [[Carl Wilson]] \u2013 lead guitar, background vocals\n* [[Dennis Wilson]] \u2013 background vocals\n\n;Additional Personnel\n* Frank DeVito \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n== Variations ==\nThe song was first released on an album as the title track on the band's 1963 album ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' In July 1963, a month after the song had been issued as a single in the United States, Capitol issued the ''Surfin' U.S.A. EP'' featuring \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" & \"Shut Down\" on the A-side and \"Surfer Girl\" & \"Surfin' Safari\" on the B-side. The EP however, failed to chart.\nIn May, 2003 Capitol again issued the song on an EP along with \"Surfer Girl\", \"Don't Worry, Baby\", and \"The Beach Boys Medley\". However, the record failed to make an impact on the charts.\n\nA demo version of the song featuring only Brian Wilson singing and playing piano was released on the 1993 box set, ''[[Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys]]''. A different demo version, in which Wilson is joined by drums was released on the 2001 archival release ''Hawthorne, CA''. Both demos feature similar minor lyrical differences from the final recording. Both demos are played in the key of E major, in contrast to the final recording which was pitched in E{{music|b}}.\n\nThe instrumental track of the final recording was also released on the ''Hawthorne, CA'' album. This version of the cut does not 'fade out', but continues on well past the original ending of the song until it ends abruptly.\n\n=== Live performances ===\nAfter being released the song became a concert regular for the band. The band recorded live versions of \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" on several Beach Boys albums. It was first released on ''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'' album. A concert from Anaheim Stadium on July 3, 1976, which featured the song was filmed and produced by Lorne Michaels for a Beach Boys television special which first aired in the United States in August, 1976. The TV special was later released on VHS and DVD as ''Good Vibrations Tour''. In 1980, a live rendition was recorded, though not released until 2002 on the ''[[Good Timin': Live at Knebworth England 1980]]'' live album. Footage from the concert was also released on VHS and DVD format. A live version was also released on the band's 1993 box set ''Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys''.\n\nThe band also performed a live version of the song at the NBC Television Studios in [[Burbank, California]], which was filmed on March 14, 1964. Footage of the concert was later released on the DVD ''The Lost Concert''. The band performed the song on ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'' which was filmed at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964, and featured other top artists of the day such as Chuck Berry, [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Supremes]], [[James Brown]] & [[The Famous Flames]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The concert was released as a film in 1964 featuring the Beach Boys performance. However, after the initial showing of the film Brian insisted that the band's performance be cut from the film. Because of a rights dispute the footage of the Beach Boys' performance does not appear in most versions of ''The T.A.M.I. Show''. The footage was eventually released on the DVD ''Sights of Summer'' included with the special 2004 edition of ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]''.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 1985 film ''[[Teen Wolf (film)|Teen Wolf]]'', Scott Howard ([[Michael J. Fox]]) and his friend Stiles enjoy standing on the roof of Scott's father's delivery van (and later Stiles's step van), mimicking surfing while blasting the song.\n\nThe song is also played when Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are in the car in ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''.\n\nThe song was one of many California-related songs played throughout \"Sunshine Plaza\" in the original [[Disney California Adventure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parktunes.com/sections/12|title=Sunshine Plaza music from Disney's California Adventure \u2013 ParkTunes|website=www.parktunes.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925141224/http://www.parktunes.com/sections/12|archive-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe song was played during the ending scene and over the end credits of the ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' episode \"[[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|Calling All Cars]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/|title=Calling All Cars (4.11)|date=19 January 2014|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426030252/https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/|archive-date=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nA parody song, \"Surfin' U.S.S.R.\" was a single by country novelty artist [[Ray Stevens]] from his 1988 album ''[[I Never Made a Record I Didn't Like]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|E87aVjQ-UAo|\"Surfin USSR\"}}</ref>\n\nThe lyrics are included as a chapter in the compendium by [[Caroline Kennedy]], ''A Patriot's Handbook''.\n\nThe song opened [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)#Season 4 (2019)|The Man in the High Castle Season 4]] as main character Juliana [[Parallel universes in fiction|crossed to the alternate world]] where [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] won [[World War II]], rather than the main world that United States is conquered and divided by [[Axis powers|Axis]].\n\n==Leif Garrett version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Surfin' U.S.A.\n| cover      = Surfin'_U.S.A._-_Leif_Garrett.jpg\n| alt        =\n| border     = yes\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Leif Garrett]]\n| album      = [[Leif Garrett (album)|Leif Garrett]]\n| B-side     = Special Kind of Girl\n| released   = August 1977\n| format     = 7\"\n| recorded   = 1977\n| studio     = [[Atlantic Studios]] ([[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]])\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Surf rock]]|[[Pop music|Pop]]}}\n| length     = \n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| writer     = Chuck Berry\n| producer   = [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n| prev_title = Come Back When You Grow Up\n| prev_year  = 1977\n| next_title = [[Runaround Sue#Leif Garrett cover|Runaround Sue]]\n| next_year  = 1977\n| misc       = \n}}\n\n==Cover versions==\n* 1964 \u2013 Rod and the Cobras on ''Drag Race At Surf City''\n* 1972 \u2013 [[Takeshi Terauchi]] & Blue Jeans ([[instrumental]]), ''Manatsu no Umi wo Buttobase!!

The song peaked on the ''Billboard'' pop chart at number three, the band's first top ten hit therein (see also ''Surfin' Safari''). The B-side charted at number 23. Although the double-sided hit single registered in ''Billboard'' as number one in chart points at the end of the year (tabulated up to mid November 1963) and was cited by ''Billboard'' as \"best-selling record of the year\", in a low-selling year for singles in the US it apparently did not initially sell a million copies\u2014and has never been issued an [[RIAA certification|RIAA Gold Disc award]]. The song was re-issued in the U.S. as a single in July 1974 backed with \"[[The Warmth of the Sun]]\". That single also hit the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, peaking at 36.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the single was released in June 1963. The third single by the band to be issued in the UK, it became the first single to chart. It would go on to peak at 34 (28 in the ''[[New Musical Express]]'').\n\nIn Australia, the single was released in 1963 and peaked at 9, becoming the band's first single to chart in Australia. The single was re-released in Australia in 1974 and again charted, peaking at 66. In Canada and Sweden, the single was released in 1963 and peaked on the charts at 6 in both countries. In July 1963, in the national charts used by ''Billboard'', it peaked at #9 in Hong Kong, #8 in Austria the following month; in August 1964 at #9 for two weeks in Japan.\n\n===Charts===\n;The Beach Boys\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1963)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart<ref name=\"Canadian Singles Charts\">{{cite web | title=Canadian Singles Charts | publisher=mountvernonandfairway.de | url=http://www.mountvernonandfairway.de/charts8.htm | access-date=12 November 2007 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310033408/http://www.mountvernonandfairway.de/charts8.htm | archive-date=10 March 2007 | df= }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''Lever Hit Parade'')<ref>[http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20lever&qsongid=902#n_view_location Flavour of New Zealand, 20 June 1963]</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n!Chart (1974)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|36\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|66\n|}\n;Leif Garrett\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1977)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany|6|artist=Leif Garrett|song=Surfin USA}}\n|-\n|Canada ''RPM'' Adult Contemporary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5411&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5411.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5411|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1977-10-01 |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|48\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles<ref name=\"govofcanada\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/image.aspx?Image=nlc008388.5447a&URLjpg=http%3a%2f%2fwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca%2fobj%2f028020%2ff4%2fnlc008388.5447a.gif&Ecopy=nlc008388.5447a|title=Item Display - RPM - Library and Archives Canada |website=Collectionscanada.gc.ca |date=1977-10-29 |accessdate=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|32\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' - {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|20\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>[http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19771022.html Cash Box Top 100 Singles, , 1977]</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|29\n|-\n|}\n\n==Personnel==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\n;The Beach Boys\n* [[Mike Love]] \u2013 [[lead vocal]]\n* [[David Marks]] \u2013 rhythm guitar\n* [[Brian Wilson]] \u2013 [[bass guitar]], [[Organ (music)|organ]], [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]]\n* [[Carl Wilson]] \u2013 lead guitar, background vocals\n* [[Dennis Wilson]] \u2013 background vocals\n\n;Additional Personnel\n* Frank DeVito \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n\n== Variations ==\nThe song was first released on an album as the title track on the band's 1963 album ''Surfin' U.S.A.'' In July 1963, a month after the song had been issued as a single in the United States, Capitol issued the ''Surfin' U.S.A. EP'' featuring \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" & \"Shut Down\" on the A-side and \"Surfer Girl\" & \"Surfin' Safari\" on the B-side. The EP however, failed to chart.\nIn May, 2003 Capitol again issued the song on an EP along with \"Surfer Girl\", \"Don't Worry, Baby\", and \"The Beach Boys Medley\". However, the record failed to make an impact on the charts.\n\nA demo version of the song featuring only Brian Wilson singing and playing piano was released on the 1993 box set, ''[[Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys]]''. A different demo version, in which Wilson is joined by drums was released on the 2001 archival release ''Hawthorne, CA''. Both demos feature similar minor lyrical differences from the final recording. Both demos are played in the key of E major, in contrast to the final recording which was pitched in E{{music|b}}.\n\nThe instrumental track of the final recording was also released on the ''Hawthorne, CA'' album. This version of the cut does not 'fade out', but continues on well past the original ending of the song until it ends abruptly.\n\n=== Live performances ===\nAfter being released the song became a concert regular for the band. The band recorded live versions of \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" on several Beach Boys albums. It was first released on ''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'' album. A concert from Anaheim Stadium on July 3, 1976, which featured the song was filmed and produced by Lorne Michaels for a Beach Boys television special which first aired in the United States in August, 1976. The TV special was later released on VHS and DVD as ''Good Vibrations Tour''. In 1980, a live rendition was recorded, though not released until 2002 on the ''[[Good Timin': Live at Knebworth England 1980]]'' live album. Footage from the concert was also released on VHS and DVD format. A live version was also released on the band's 1993 box set ''Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys''.\n\nThe band also performed a live version of the song at the NBC Television Studios in [[Burbank, California]], which was filmed on March 14, 1964. Footage of the concert was later released on the DVD ''The Lost Concert''. The band performed the song on ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'' which was filmed at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium on October 28 and 29, 1964, and featured other top artists of the day such as Chuck Berry, [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Supremes]], [[James Brown]] & [[The Famous Flames]] and [[The Rolling Stones]]. The concert was released as a film in 1964 featuring the Beach Boys performance. However, after the initial showing of the film Brian insisted that the band's performance be cut from the film. Because of a rights dispute the footage of the Beach Boys' performance does not appear in most versions of ''The T.A.M.I. Show''. The footage was eventually released on the DVD ''Sights of Summer'' included with the special 2004 edition of ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]''.\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the 1985 film ''[[Teen Wolf (film)|Teen Wolf]]'', Scott Howard ([[Michael J. Fox]]) and his friend Stiles enjoy standing on the roof of Scott's father's delivery van (and later Stiles's step van), mimicking surfing while blasting the song.\n\nThe song is also played when Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker are in the car in ''[[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]]''.\n\nThe song was one of many California-related songs played throughout \"Sunshine Plaza\" in the original [[Disney California Adventure]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parktunes.com/sections/12|title=Sunshine Plaza music from Disney's California Adventure \u2013 ParkTunes|website=www.parktunes.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925141224/http://www.parktunes.com/sections/12|archive-date=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe song was played during the ending scene and over the end credits of the ''[[The Sopranos|Sopranos]]'' episode \"[[Calling All Cars (The Sopranos)|Calling All Cars]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/|title=Calling All Cars (4.11)|date=19 January 2014|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426030252/https://sopranosautopsy.com/season-4-2/calling-all-cars-4-11/|archive-date=26 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nA parody song, \"Surfin' U.S.S.R.\" was a single by country novelty artist [[Ray Stevens]] from his 1988 album ''[[I Never Made a Record I Didn't Like]]''.<ref>{{YouTube|E87aVjQ-UAo|\"Surfin USSR\"}}</ref>\n\nThe lyrics are included as a chapter in the compendium by [[Caroline Kennedy]], ''A Patriot's Handbook''.\n\nThe song opened [[The Man in the High Castle (TV series)#Season 4 (2019)|The Man in the High Castle Season 4]] as main character Juliana [[Parallel universes in fiction|crossed to the alternate world]] where [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] won [[World War II]], rather than the main world that United States is conquered and divided by [[Axis powers|Axis]].\n\n==Leif Garrett version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Surfin' U.S.A.\n| cover      = Surfin'_U.S.A._-_Leif_Garrett.jpg\n| alt        =\n| border     = yes\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Leif Garrett]]\n| album      = [[Leif Garrett (album)|Leif Garrett]]\n| B-side     = Special Kind of Girl\n| released   = August 1977\n| format     = 7\"\n| recorded   = 1977\n| studio     = [[Atlantic Studios]] ([[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]])\n| genre      = {{hlist|[[Surf rock]]|[[Pop music|Pop]]}}\n| length     = \n| label      = [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]]\n| writer     = Chuck Berry\n| producer   = [[Michael Lloyd (music producer)|Michael Lloyd]]\n| prev_title = Come Back When You Grow Up\n| prev_year  = 1977\n| next_title = [[Runaround Sue#Leif Garrett cover|Runaround Sue]]\n| next_year  = 1977\n| misc       = \n}}\n\n==Cover versions==\n* 1964 \u2013 Rod and the Cobras on ''Drag Race At Surf City''\n* 1972 \u2013 [[Takeshi Terauchi]] & Blue Jeans ([[instrumental]]), ''Manatsu no Umi wo Buttobase!!

The series debuted on the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] network, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Neox (TV channel)|Neox]] and [[Paramount Comedy (Spain)|Paramount Comedy]]. Antena 3 Internacional satellite channel broadcasts the series to Latin America. The series debuted in 2003 and became popular thanks to its funny characters, witty script, and capacity to integrate and poke fun at contemporary issues; the program presents a caustic satire of many of the 'types' found in Spanish society.\n\nIn 2006, Antena 3's rival [[Telecinco]] acquired a 15% share of Miram\u00f3n Mendi, the company that produces the series. Miram\u00f3n's contract with Antena 3 expired in June 2006 and was not renewed, bringing the series to an end, since the actors' contracts bind them to the production company and not to the network. Miram\u00f3n Mendi then created a new series for Telecinco with most of the same actors and a similar setting, but with brand-new characters and storyline. ''[[La que se avecina]]'' d\u00e9buted 22 April 2007.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Porter's lodge===\n* '''Emilio Delgado Mart\u00edn''' (''[[Fernando Tejero]]'') \u2013 The building's porter. He is in his mid-thirties and lives in the porter's lodge with his father, Mariano. He is an unambitious man who just wants to live without worries and have a steady girlfriend. Unluckily, he is in the wrong building for that. He is a gossip who always has a comeback for everything. He was in college for a while, until he got kicked out. He has had three girlfriends so far: Roc\u00edo (a mailwoman with a young son whom he almost married), Bel\u00e9n (a complicated relationship where they have broken up and gotten together again several times) and Carmen (his college professor). His most well known catchphrase, \"un poquito de por favor\" (a little bit of please), has quickly become an everyday use idiom around Spain. It has even been parodied in other shows, and not only in the show's own station, Antena 3.\n* '''Mariano Delgado''' (''[[Eduardo G\u00f3mez (actor)|Eduardo G\u00f3mez]]'') \u2013 Emilio's father, though not exactly a model one. He's separated from Emilio's mother and, since he has no place to live, he made himself one with his son. He has a lot of nerve, is a womanizer without much luck, and he's always concocting one money scheme or another. It won't be the first time Emilio has kicked him out, but he always takes him back. His [[catchphrase]] is ''ignorante de la vida'', criticizing the younger generation for being ignorant about life. He enjoys a brief career as a comedian with his performance being called ''Cr\u00f3nicas Marianas'', \"The Mariano Chronicles\", a reference to the Spanish late-night TV show [[Cr\u00f3nicas Marcianas]]. In spite of his unstylish look, he considers himself a [[metrosexual]], much to the amusement of his neighbours and son.\n\n===1-A===\n''Radiopatio'' (roughly translated into \"gossip yard\") headquarters, as they call their \"gossip agency\", home of three old ladies nicknamed ''las Supernenas'' ([[The Powerpuff Girls]]), ''las tres mellizas'' ([[The Triplets]]), and ''las brujas de Eastwick'' ([[The Witches of Eastwick]]), among others. Their common hobbies are gossip, bingo and shoplifting.\n\n* '''Vicenta Benito Valbuena''' (''[[Gemma Cuervo]]'') \u2013 Lives in flat 1-A. She's a retired woman that has never married and who's still a virgin. She's really naive (to the point that she seems dumb) and polite but also very optimistic. Her dog Valentin is the most important thing for her. Alongside her sister Marisa and her friend Concha, they're the source of all gossiping in the building. She's got a crush on Andr\u00e9s. When Marisa's husband gets back they end up together to everyone's amazement. She is still waiting for her true love. At first it seems that she is silly but in fact is very clever when she wants.\n* '''Maria Luisa ''\"Marisa\"'' Benito Valbuena''' (''[[Mariv\u00ed Bilbao]]'') \u2013 Vicenta's older sister. After her husband Manolo left her, Vicenta took her in her home. She's the polar opposite of her sister, a harsh, ironic chain-smoker, \"chinch\u00f3n\" (anisette)-drinking who always speaks her mind. She would like to retire to [[Benidorm]] with a handsome German. Alongside her sister and her friend Concha, they like to spy on others in the building and spread gossip.  Marisa is often seen smoking and carries a large bottle of [[Chinch\u00f3n (drink)|Chinch\u00f3n]] liquor in her purse and wearing teen clothes.\n* '''Concepci\u00f3n ''\"Concha\"''  de la Fuente Garc\u00eda''' (''[[Emma Penella]]'') \u2013 In the first season, she lives in flat 2-B with her son Armando and her grandson Dani. Afterwards, they move out and she sells the flat to the Guerra family. But her son puts her in a retirement home because the woman he moved in with doesn't like her, which angers Concha. She went to live with her friends Vicenta and Marisa. She still has another flat in the building, which she rents to Bel\u00e9n without a contract. In later seasons, she decides to sell it, and Bel\u00e9n buys it using a plot that Concha doesn't like one bit.\n\n===1-B===\n* '''Mauricio \"''Mauri''\" Hidalgo Torres''' (''[[Luis Merlo]]'') \u2013 A gay journalist who used to work for a [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]-type magazine. He's unstable, [[hypochondriac]], has many obsessions and he's pretty insecure. Mauri frequently finds himself not sure as to whether or not his potential love's interests are gay. During the first season, he lived with his boyfriend Fernando, but he left to work in London. Later he had a son, Ezequiel, by [[artificial insemination]] with his lesbian roommate Bea. He also had an affair with Lucia's brother Diego, which ended when Diego got involved with Abel, his baby son's  [[nanny]]. Fernando has since returned and they're living together again. Recently, Mauri decided to write a book at Fernando's urging and his own lack of fulfillment with his career. After suffering from severe writer's block, he was helped by Mariano to write an action novel featuring a truck driver who is struck by lightning and gains precognition powers.

She doesn't have a steady job and has worked in a lot of occupations ([[waitress]] in a burger restaurant and in Lucia's restaurant, receptionist in an undertakers, shop assistant and [[parking meter]] controller, among others). She eventually gets together with Emilio, to the point of living together, but they finally break up.

He finally finds a girlfriend at Diego and Abel's wedding and he gets very upset when his friends joke about the fact she's not very pretty. They finally get married, but soon thereafter they start having serious problems. Separated from his wife, he has now moved to the top floor apartment with his friend Pablo. He has started relationship with Belen but they split up.\n\n===Non-resident characters===\n* '''Rafael \u00c1lvarez''' (''[[Nicol\u00e1s Due\u00f1as]]'') \u2013 Luc\u00edas father, who, after his daughter leaves, moved temporarily into her flat with his butler and cook while he was having his house refurbished. The wealthy owner of a speculative construction company, completely amoral and willing to do anything for money, he tried to buy the building several times, including setting fire to it.\n* '''Marta''' (''[[Assumpta Serna]]'') \u2013 The president of the building on the opposite side of the road. She's nicknamed ''pantumaca'' due to her strong [[Catalan language|Catalan]] accent. Divorced for several years, she falls in love with Juan Cuesta, who hesitates between her and ''La hierbas''.

A very controlling woman with an acerbic tongue. She ended up in coma after falling down the interior courtyard from her window while fighting with Isabel. She finally got out of her coma, only to be run over with a car by Isabel. She was in coma for a long time, until she died. The day she was cremated Juan discovered that she cheated with a vacuum cleaner seller.<br /> The reason for Loles Le\u00f3n's character death was because the actress asked for a pay rise, since the show was getting good ratings, but the producing company didn't consent, so her character was put into coma until the discussion was solved. While in coma, Paloma appeared a few times on the show, but since Loles wasn't working with them due to the salary problem, her face was never shown, always being facing away or just her legs. When Loles lost her case with the company and decided to sign off, Paloma's death was produced.\n* '''Armando''' (''[[Joseba Apaolaza]]'') \u2013 Concha's son. After the first season, he moved away to live in a house with his new girlfriend and tried, unsuccessfully, to put his mother in a retirement home. Fernando being a closeted homosexual, he and Mauri tried to fend off the building suspicions about them being gay by befriending Armando, inviting him over to watch football matches and other considered manly things. Unluckily for them, it was all worthless, since Armando leaves their home (after the match finished) by saying \"I thought you gay people were a bit more tactful\", after Mauri and Fernando behaved like the stereotypical \"macho\".\n* '''Alex Guerra''' (''[[Juan D\u00edaz Pardeiro|Juan D\u00edaz]]'') \u2013 Isabel and Andr\u00e9s' eldest son.

She moved in with him (without asking him first) after Paloma's accident to help him. Unlike her brother, she has a strong character and wants things done her way. She has some money, but she is stingy. She has a fallout with her brother over his relationship with Isabel and, after some trouble, ends up buying Isabel's flat and starting a relationship with her former husband Andr\u00e9s, trying by all means to get back at her brother. When things between Andr\u00e9s and her fall through, she moves away, leaving her brother in charge of renting (and later, selling) the flat.\n* '''Roberto Alonso''' ([[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n (actor)|''Daniel Guzm\u00e1n'']]) \u2013 Luc\u00eda's boyfriend. He's an architect, but works drawing [[erotic]] comics. He's brilliant, but he has no ambitions and he's lazy. After his relationship with Luc\u00eda ends, he moves to the building's attic and tries to get her back several times. After finally giving up, he now lives in 2-B with his ex-rival turned friend Carlos, trying to get him over his depression. He finally moves away to [[Puerto Ban\u00fas]] to continue with his profitable business of drawing caricatures.\n* '''Carlos''' (''[[Diego Mart\u00edn Gabriel|Diego Mart\u00edn]]'') \u2013 Luc\u00eda's childhood friend. A rich kid like her, he lives off his family's money. Carlos is very unsure of himself, and ends up doing wacky, impulsive things, such as pretending to be gay and trying to start a relationship with Mauri. He's been after Lucia since forever, but she never wanted to date him. He helps her with her restaurant business, and gets infatuated with Alicia. Eventually, Carlos buys the video shop in the ground floor and ousts Juan as building president, gaining popular support by paying for a new [[elevator]] and [[Hot tub|spa]] in the attic. In a New Year's Eve party, he has a drunken one-night stand with Alba, and she becomes pregnant with his daughter, whom he agrees to support. After much trouble, Luc\u00eda finally gives him a chance, but it doesn't last long. Totally depressed, he agrees to share a flat with Roberto, but he can't get over the depression, and checks himself into a depression clinic, selling both the flat and the videoclub.\n* '''Luc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez''' (''[[Mar\u00eda Ad\u00e1nez]]'') \u2013 Called ''La Pija'' (the posh). The daughter of the wealthy owner of a construction company, Luc\u00eda arrives at the building to live with her boyfriend Roberto. She works in her father's company and she's used to good clothes and the finer things. Eventually, her relationship with Roberto falls through and she decides to quit her father's company and do things by herself. She tries opening a restaurant, but it doesn't work. She goes through some difficult times after she refuses her father's money, but things start to get better once she gives her old boyfriend Carlos another chance. But things fall through quickly. She finds a new boyfriend in Yago, an ecology nut whose principles she adopts to get along with him. In the end, however, she believes in them more than he does and leaves with an NGO to Somalia. As Marisa puts it, her appearance is always neat and stylish, which is emphasised by the catchphrase \"qu\u00e9 mona va esta chica siempre\" (how well-groomed is always this girl).\n* '''Andr\u00e9s Guerra''' (''[[Santiago Ramos S\u00e1nchez|Santiago Ramos]]'') \u2013 Isabel's husband. A middle-aged businessman of doubtful reputation, he has to sell his house after some trouble with the [[Treasury]] and he moves with his family to 2-B. He has a sports shop ''Deportes Guerra'' and he's always into doubtful business affairs. Eventually he's jailed, but he's able to get out when Vicenta pays his [[Bail bond|bond]]. But she has a crush on him, and he has to play along so she wouldn't retire the bond money. He suspects his wife is having an affair for a while, but he doesn't know with whom until she tells him in a very inappropriate moment. He later starts a relationship with Nieves which falls through fast. For a while he lives alone in the attic, turning increasingly bitter, with an apparent [[Diogenes syndrome]]. He enjoys a brief relationship with Carmen. Finally, after a freak accident, he ends up with [[amnesia]], and Vicenta tries to make him think that they are married. When he realises that he doesn't have anything left for him at Calle Desenga\u00f1o 21, he leaves the building and leaves the show for good.\n* '''Alicia Sanz''' (''[[Laura Pamplona]]'') \u2013 Belen's roommate. A would-be actress, Alicia is vain, selfish, completely without tact and not above rubbing her success with men in her less successful flatmate Belen's face. She goes through men like shoes, never falling in love with one. She toys with Carlos for a while, getting expensive gifts from him but never giving him anything in return. Occasionally (very occasionally) a bit of friendly generosity comes through. After Emilio moves up with Bel\u00e9n, they quarrel and Alicia moves in with a now single Luc\u00eda. After a while, she and Bel\u00e9n patch things through and she returns to 3-B. Eventually, Alicia finally falls in love with a man, Ricardo, and moves to New York City with him.\n* '''Carmen Villanueva''' (''[[Llum Barrera]]'') \u2013 A college professor, and the daughter of the [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]], she meets Emilio when he attends one of her classes and they start a relationship. Carmen knows what she wants and she's very sure of herself, but she has some insane tendencies. After she and Emilio break up, she moves in with Bel\u00e9n to try to recover him, up to the point to calling up her former crazy boyfriend to make him jealous, but it doesn't work. She later rents 2-B from Nieves, and Bea moves in with her. She has a crush on Fernando, even after Bea tells her he's gay, and tries to seduce him, but he flees away scared. She lived at 3-B with Bea, Bel\u00e9n and ''Inga'' for a while, but finally moved back with her parents.\n*'''Salvador Villarejo''' (''[[Jordi S\u00e1nchez (actor)|Jordi S\u00e1nchez]]'') - He is catholic priest and Bea's brother.

Mauri gets angry and tries to prevent their wedding, but finally he marries Abel, being the first gay married couple in Spain. But soon thereafter, he admits he has made an error, that it was too soon and that he misses Mauri. But Mauri's former boyfriend Fernando (who turns out to be a former college classmate of his) has since then returned.\n* '''Alba''' (''[[Marta Belenguer]]'') \u2013 Diego's not completely sane wife.

The series debuted on the [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]] network, and was later rerun by the same network as well as cable/satellite channels [[Neox (TV channel)|Neox]] and [[Paramount Comedy (Spain)|Paramount Comedy]]. Antena 3 Internacional satellite channel broadcasts the series to Latin America. The series debuted in 2003 and became popular thanks to its funny characters, witty script, and capacity to integrate and poke fun at contemporary issues; the program presents a caustic satire of many of the 'types' found in Spanish society.\n\nIn 2006, Antena 3's rival [[Telecinco]] acquired a 15% share of Miram\u00f3n Mendi, the company that produces the series. Miram\u00f3n's contract with Antena 3 expired in June 2006 and was not renewed, bringing the series to an end, since the actors' contracts bind them to the production company and not to the network. Miram\u00f3n Mendi then created a new series for Telecinco with most of the same actors and a similar setting, but with brand-new characters and storyline. ''[[La que se avecina]]'' d\u00e9buted 22 April 2007.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Porter's lodge===\n* '''Emilio Delgado Mart\u00edn''' (''[[Fernando Tejero]]'') \u2013 The building's porter. He is in his mid-thirties and lives in the porter's lodge with his father, Mariano. He is an unambitious man who just wants to live without worries and have a steady girlfriend. Unluckily, he is in the wrong building for that. He is a gossip who always has a comeback for everything. He was in college for a while, until he got kicked out. He has had three girlfriends so far: Roc\u00edo (a mailwoman with a young son whom he almost married), Bel\u00e9n (a complicated relationship where they have broken up and gotten together again several times) and Carmen (his college professor). His most well known catchphrase, \"un poquito de por favor\" (a little bit of please), has quickly become an everyday use idiom around Spain. It has even been parodied in other shows, and not only in the show's own station, Antena 3.\n* '''Mariano Delgado''' (''[[Eduardo G\u00f3mez (actor)|Eduardo G\u00f3mez]]'') \u2013 Emilio's father, though not exactly a model one. He's separated from Emilio's mother and, since he has no place to live, he made himself one with his son. He has a lot of nerve, is a womanizer without much luck, and he's always concocting one money scheme or another. It won't be the first time Emilio has kicked him out, but he always takes him back. His [[catchphrase]] is ''ignorante de la vida'', criticizing the younger generation for being ignorant about life. He enjoys a brief career as a comedian with his performance being called ''Cr\u00f3nicas Marianas'', \"The Mariano Chronicles\", a reference to the Spanish late-night TV show [[Cr\u00f3nicas Marcianas]]. In spite of his unstylish look, he considers himself a [[metrosexual]], much to the amusement of his neighbours and son.\n\n===1-A===\n''Radiopatio'' (roughly translated into \"gossip yard\") headquarters, as they call their \"gossip agency\", home of three old ladies nicknamed ''las Supernenas'' ([[The Powerpuff Girls]]), ''las tres mellizas'' ([[The Triplets]]), and ''las brujas de Eastwick'' ([[The Witches of Eastwick]]), among others. Their common hobbies are gossip, bingo and shoplifting.\n\n* '''Vicenta Benito Valbuena''' (''[[Gemma Cuervo]]'') \u2013 Lives in flat 1-A. She's a retired woman that has never married and who's still a virgin. She's really naive (to the point that she seems dumb) and polite but also very optimistic. Her dog Valentin is the most important thing for her. Alongside her sister Marisa and her friend Concha, they're the source of all gossiping in the building. She's got a crush on Andr\u00e9s. When Marisa's husband gets back they end up together to everyone's amazement. She is still waiting for her true love. At first it seems that she is silly but in fact is very clever when she wants.\n* '''Maria Luisa ''\"Marisa\"'' Benito Valbuena''' (''[[Mariv\u00ed Bilbao]]'') \u2013 Vicenta's older sister. After her husband Manolo left her, Vicenta took her in her home. She's the polar opposite of her sister, a harsh, ironic chain-smoker, \"chinch\u00f3n\" (anisette)-drinking who always speaks her mind. She would like to retire to [[Benidorm]] with a handsome German. Alongside her sister and her friend Concha, they like to spy on others in the building and spread gossip.  Marisa is often seen smoking and carries a large bottle of [[Chinch\u00f3n (drink)|Chinch\u00f3n]] liquor in her purse and wearing teen clothes.\n* '''Concepci\u00f3n ''\"Concha\"''  de la Fuente Garc\u00eda''' (''[[Emma Penella]]'') \u2013 In the first season, she lives in flat 2-B with her son Armando and her grandson Dani. Afterwards, they move out and she sells the flat to the Guerra family. But her son puts her in a retirement home because the woman he moved in with doesn't like her, which angers Concha. She went to live with her friends Vicenta and Marisa. She still has another flat in the building, which she rents to Bel\u00e9n without a contract. In later seasons, she decides to sell it, and Bel\u00e9n buys it using a plot that Concha doesn't like one bit.\n\n===1-B===\n* '''Mauricio \"''Mauri''\" Hidalgo Torres''' (''[[Luis Merlo]]'') \u2013 A gay journalist who used to work for a [[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]-type magazine. He's unstable, [[hypochondriac]], has many obsessions and he's pretty insecure. Mauri frequently finds himself not sure as to whether or not his potential love's interests are gay. During the first season, he lived with his boyfriend Fernando, but he left to work in London. Later he had a son, Ezequiel, by [[artificial insemination]] with his lesbian roommate Bea. He also had an affair with Lucia's brother Diego, which ended when Diego got involved with Abel, his baby son's  [[nanny]]. Fernando has since returned and they're living together again. Recently, Mauri decided to write a book at Fernando's urging and his own lack of fulfillment with his career. After suffering from severe writer's block, he was helped by Mariano to write an action novel featuring a truck driver who is struck by lightning and gains precognition powers. Although he found the story ridiculous, he went with the idea. The book became a best-seller.\n* '''Fernando Navarro S\u00e1nchez''' (''[[Adri\u00e0 Collado]]'') \u2013 Mauri's lawyer boyfriend during season 1. After he lost his job when he came out, he got a very good job offer at London and finally decided to take it. They did the long-distance relationship thing for a while, but they finally broke up as friends. He has since returned and, after a bit of fumbling, he and Mauri are living together again. He has decided to start his own practice, and him and Mauri have [[Same-sex marriage in Spain|just married]].\n\n===2-A===\n* '''Juan Cuesta''' (''[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Gil]]'') \u2013 A middle-aged high school teacher and long time homeowners council president, a position that defines who he is. He's a very grey man, completely controlled by his wife, he's a born worrier and nobody respects him. But, as president of this building, he always sees himself in the middle of some big messy affairs. He's married to Paloma, until she ends up in coma. He then starts an affair with his new neighbour, Isabel and, after a spectacular coming out, they move in together. He has divorced his wife, but has not yet married Isabel. He lost his job and his position as strata council president in later seasons, and with them his purpose in life. He has since then found a new job and recovered the strata council presidency.\n* '''Natalia Cuesta''' (''[[Sof\u00eda Nieto]]'') \u2013 Juan and Paloma's teen daughter. She's got a lot more freedom since her mother is in coma. She's had several boyfriends, among them Pablo, with whom she lived under her aunt's roof for a while. She moved out to live on her own, but soon returned and she's now studying [[psychology]]. She got pregnant as a [[surrogate pregnancy|surrogate]] mother for a couple that soon backed out of the deal; she still carries on with her pregnancy. She has started a relationship with Yago.\n* '''Jos\u00e9 Miguel \"Josemi\" Cuesta''' (''[[Eduardo Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez]]'') \u2013 Juan and Paloma's son, who is in his early teens. A lazy but gifted boy, always quick to take advantage of opportunities. Jos\u00e9 Miguel has the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of a genius, and was offered a chance to [[study abroad]] in Canada, but opted to stay in Spain. He's in love with Candela, in 2-B.\n* '''Isabel Ruiz''' (''[[Isabel Ordaz]]'') \u2013 Called ''La Hierbas'' (herb-woman or \"pot head\") by her neighbours, she moves in with her family after buying flat 2-B from Concha. A neurotic hypochondriac with a laisser-faire attitude, she's big time into [[natural therapy]], [[herbal remedies]] and [[yoga]]. After her husband gets jailed, she starts an affair with Juan, which eventually leads to the end of her marriage. She moves in with Juan and his children and eventually sells her flat. After Juan loses his job, she is forced to return to work as a nurse, to her chagrin.\n* '''Yago''' (''[[Roberto San Martin]]'') \u2013 Nicknamed ''el Sabros\u00f3n'' (the babbler) by the neighbours, is Luc\u00eda's [[Cuba]]n ex-boyfriend, whom she met while on holidays when she was still engaged to Carlos. He's an ecology nut, very active in his NGO ''Aldeas Verdes'' (''Green Villages'') and Luc\u00eda adopts his principles to get along with him. They've had several crisis when he caught her with Carlos and Roberto. After she leaves for [[Somalia]], he moves into the attic and starts a relationship with Natalia. He now lives with her in the 2-A.\n\n===2-B===\n* '''Higinio''' (''[[Ricardo Arroyo]]'') \u2013 used to be building's plumber and building worker until he bought the 2-B flat from Carlos. He's a laid-back man, who doesn't want problems in life. He started renovating 2-A, but then his wife Mamen got angry at them and told him to stop. He now has to work secretly at night.\n* '''Mamen''' (''[[Emma Ozores]]'') \u2013 Higinio's wife. She likes to have all perfect at home.

It still belongs to her, and her father lived there for a while  with his butler and cook while he's having his house refurbished. Natalia and Yago have rented it while the 2-A is undergoing renovations.\n\n===3-B===\n* '''Bel\u00e9n L\u00f3pez V\u00e1zquez''' (''[[Malena Alterio]]'') \u2013 She's nicknamed ''la Golfa'' (the ''Tart'')  by her landlady. She rents flat 3-B from Concha, without a contract (a fact she reminds her landlady often). Harsh and fussy, she's very bitter because of her lack of success with men. She doesn't have a steady job and has worked in a lot of occupations ([[waitress]] in a burger restaurant and in Lucia's restaurant, receptionist in an undertakers, shop assistant and [[parking meter]] controller, among others). She eventually gets together with Emilio, to the point of living together, but they finally break up. Since then, they have broken up and gotten together again several times, including an affair while he was dating Carmen. She had a [[one night stand]] with Roberto.

She moved in with Mauri after breaking-up with her girlfriend In\u00e9s, when Mauri was looking for a roommate after Fernando left. She's a [[veterinarian]], open, optimistic and sure of herself. She wanted to have a child and asked Mauri to be [[sperm donor]]. He wasn't supposed to get involved with raising the child, but finally he did and in a big way. For a while, she dated lesbian lawyer Rosa, but the relationship ended when she made Bea choose between her and Mauri after her son, Ezequiel, was born. After Fernando returned, she moved to 2-B with her new friend Carmen. Later, she lived in 3-B with Bel\u00e9n and Ana, her new girlfriend.\n* '''Ana 'Inga'''' (''[[Vanesa Romero]]'') \u2013 Nicknamed ''Inga'' or ''la Sirenita'' (''The Little Mermaid'') by the neighbours, she's a very beautiful [[air hostess]] who, after a passionate night with Bea, ends up accepting she's a lesbian and they become a couple.

After being rejected by Juan she attempts suicide on New Year's Eve but finally accepts her rejection and develops an ambiguous friendship with her rival, since every advice she gives her results in trouble and crisis for the couple.  She dated Isabel's youngest son Pablo for a while, until she made him choose between her and his friendship with Paco. She lost.\n* '''Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda''' (''[[Nacho Guerreros]]'') \u2013 A former drug addict, who still has mental problems due to that, who becomes friends with Emilio and the videoclub gang. He lives with his aunt Choni.\n* '''Father Miguel''' (''[[Manuel Mill\u00e1n]]'') \u2013 The neighbourhood priest. Ready for everything, he has been able to marry, confess and baptise characters of both sexes and all sexual orientations (as long as they don't tell the bishop). He's a singer (and a very bad one at that), always trying to sell people his singles, usually Catholic covers of hit Spanish songs.\n\n===Former characters===\n* '''Paloma Hurtado''' (''[[Loles Le\u00f3n]]'') \u2013 Juan's wife for 18 years. A very controlling woman with an acerbic tongue. She ended up in coma after falling down the interior courtyard from her window while fighting with Isabel. She finally got out of her coma, only to be run over with a car by Isabel. She was in coma for a long time, until she died. The day she was cremated Juan discovered that she cheated with a vacuum cleaner seller.<br /> The reason for Loles Le\u00f3n's character death was because the actress asked for a pay rise, since the show was getting good ratings, but the producing company didn't consent, so her character was put into coma until the discussion was solved. While in coma, Paloma appeared a few times on the show, but since Loles wasn't working with them due to the salary problem, her face was never shown, always being facing away or just her legs. When Loles lost her case with the company and decided to sign off, Paloma's death was produced.\n* '''Armando''' (''[[Joseba Apaolaza]]'') \u2013 Concha's son. After the first season, he moved away to live in a house with his new girlfriend and tried, unsuccessfully, to put his mother in a retirement home. Fernando being a closeted homosexual, he and Mauri tried to fend off the building suspicions about them being gay by befriending Armando, inviting him over to watch football matches and other considered manly things. Unluckily for them, it was all worthless, since Armando leaves their home (after the match finished) by saying \"I thought you gay people were a bit more tactful\", after Mauri and Fernando behaved like the stereotypical \"macho\".\n* '''Alex Guerra''' (''[[Juan D\u00edaz Pardeiro|Juan D\u00edaz]]'') \u2013 Isabel and Andr\u00e9s' eldest son. When the family starts [[family therapy]] to try to save the marriage, Isabel confesses Alex is the product of a pre-marriage affair with a [[Poland|Polish]] man named Jaroslav. When Isabel moves in with Juan, he goes to live with them and gets along very well with his new family. He left the series to find his real father in [[Poland]].\n* '''Nieves Cuesta''' (''[[Carmen Balagu\u00e9]]'') \u2013 Nicknamed ''la Chunga'' by the neighbours, she is Juan's single sister. She moved in with him (without asking him first) after Paloma's accident to help him. Unlike her brother, she has a strong character and wants things done her way. She has some money, but she is stingy. She has a fallout with her brother over his relationship with Isabel and, after some trouble, ends up buying Isabel's flat and starting a relationship with her former husband Andr\u00e9s, trying by all means to get back at her brother. When things between Andr\u00e9s and her fall through, she moves away, leaving her brother in charge of renting (and later, selling) the flat.\n* '''Roberto Alonso''' ([[Daniel Guzm\u00e1n (actor)|''Daniel Guzm\u00e1n'']]) \u2013 Luc\u00eda's boyfriend. He's an architect, but works drawing [[erotic]] comics. He's brilliant, but he has no ambitions and he's lazy. After his relationship with Luc\u00eda ends, he moves to the building's attic and tries to get her back several times. After finally giving up, he now lives in 2-B with his ex-rival turned friend Carlos, trying to get him over his depression. He finally moves away to [[Puerto Ban\u00fas]] to continue with his profitable business of drawing caricatures.\n* '''Carlos''' (''[[Diego Mart\u00edn Gabriel|Diego Mart\u00edn]]'') \u2013 Luc\u00eda's childhood friend. A rich kid like her, he lives off his family's money. Carlos is very unsure of himself, and ends up doing wacky, impulsive things, such as pretending to be gay and trying to start a relationship with Mauri. He's been after Lucia since forever, but she never wanted to date him. He helps her with her restaurant business, and gets infatuated with Alicia. Eventually, Carlos buys the video shop in the ground floor and ousts Juan as building president, gaining popular support by paying for a new [[elevator]] and [[Hot tub|spa]] in the attic. In a New Year's Eve party, he has a drunken one-night stand with Alba, and she becomes pregnant with his daughter, whom he agrees to support. After much trouble, Luc\u00eda finally gives him a chance, but it doesn't last long. Totally depressed, he agrees to share a flat with Roberto, but he can't get over the depression, and checks himself into a depression clinic, selling both the flat and the videoclub.\n* '''Luc\u00eda \u00c1lvarez''' (''[[Mar\u00eda Ad\u00e1nez]]'') \u2013 Called ''La Pija'' (the posh). The daughter of the wealthy owner of a construction company, Luc\u00eda arrives at the building to live with her boyfriend Roberto. She works in her father's company and she's used to good clothes and the finer things. Eventually, her relationship with Roberto falls through and she decides to quit her father's company and do things by herself. She tries opening a restaurant, but it doesn't work. She goes through some difficult times after she refuses her father's money, but things start to get better once she gives her old boyfriend Carlos another chance. But things fall through quickly. She finds a new boyfriend in Yago, an ecology nut whose principles she adopts to get along with him. In the end, however, she believes in them more than he does and leaves with an NGO to Somalia. As Marisa puts it, her appearance is always neat and stylish, which is emphasised by the catchphrase \"qu\u00e9 mona va esta chica siempre\" (how well-groomed is always this girl).\n* '''Andr\u00e9s Guerra''' (''[[Santiago Ramos S\u00e1nchez|Santiago Ramos]]'') \u2013 Isabel's husband. A middle-aged businessman of doubtful reputation, he has to sell his house after some trouble with the [[Treasury]] and he moves with his family to 2-B. He has a sports shop ''Deportes Guerra'' and he's always into doubtful business affairs. Eventually he's jailed, but he's able to get out when Vicenta pays his [[Bail bond|bond]]. But she has a crush on him, and he has to play along so she wouldn't retire the bond money. He suspects his wife is having an affair for a while, but he doesn't know with whom until she tells him in a very inappropriate moment. He later starts a relationship with Nieves which falls through fast. For a while he lives alone in the attic, turning increasingly bitter, with an apparent [[Diogenes syndrome]]. He enjoys a brief relationship with Carmen. Finally, after a freak accident, he ends up with [[amnesia]], and Vicenta tries to make him think that they are married. When he realises that he doesn't have anything left for him at Calle Desenga\u00f1o 21, he leaves the building and leaves the show for good.\n* '''Alicia Sanz''' (''[[Laura Pamplona]]'') \u2013 Belen's roommate. A would-be actress, Alicia is vain, selfish, completely without tact and not above rubbing her success with men in her less successful flatmate Belen's face. She goes through men like shoes, never falling in love with one. She toys with Carlos for a while, getting expensive gifts from him but never giving him anything in return. Occasionally (very occasionally) a bit of friendly generosity comes through. After Emilio moves up with Bel\u00e9n, they quarrel and Alicia moves in with a now single Luc\u00eda. After a while, she and Bel\u00e9n patch things through and she returns to 3-B. Eventually, Alicia finally falls in love with a man, Ricardo, and moves to New York City with him.\n* '''Carmen Villanueva''' (''[[Llum Barrera]]'') \u2013 A college professor, and the daughter of the [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]], she meets Emilio when he attends one of her classes and they start a relationship. Carmen knows what she wants and she's very sure of herself, but she has some insane tendencies. After she and Emilio break up, she moves in with Bel\u00e9n to try to recover him, up to the point to calling up her former crazy boyfriend to make him jealous, but it doesn't work. She later rents 2-B from Nieves, and Bea moves in with her. She has a crush on Fernando, even after Bea tells her he's gay, and tries to seduce him, but he flees away scared. She lived at 3-B with Bea, Bel\u00e9n and ''Inga'' for a while, but finally moved back with her parents.\n*'''Salvador Villarejo''' (''[[Jordi S\u00e1nchez]]'') - He is catholic priest and Bea's brother. He appeared briefly in season 3, before starting a trip to third world countries as missionary.\n* '''Diego \u00c1lvarez''' (''[[Mariano Alameda]]'') \u2013 Lucia's younger brother. Recently married to Alba, he meets Mauri at his sister's restaurant opening, and they start an affair. He divorces and moves in with him, but their affair ends when he falls for Abel, the male nanny of Mauri's son Ezequiel. Mauri gets angry and tries to prevent their wedding, but finally he marries Abel, being the first gay married couple in Spain. But soon thereafter, he admits he has made an error, that it was too soon and that he misses Mauri. But Mauri's former boyfriend Fernando (who turns out to be a former college classmate of his) has since then returned.\n* '''Alba''' (''[[Marta Belenguer]]'') \u2013 Diego's not completely sane wife. Jealous and insecure, she gets the shock of her life when she learns her husband is having an affair with another man. After they divorce, she has a one-night affair with Carlos, and she's now pregnant with his child.\n* '''Rosa Izquierdo''' (''[[Mar\u00eda Almud\u00e9ver]]'') \u2013 Bea's girlfriend in season 3. A strong-willed lawyer that originally was hired by Bea's former employer against her but who chose to become her lawyer instead. The two of them soon became a couple, but Rosa and Mauri never got along. In the end, they break up when Bea chooses to go with Mauri to Diego and Abel's wedding (to give him emotional support) instead of going with Rosa to meet her family.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===1st
