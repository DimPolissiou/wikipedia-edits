From arstechnica on 04/02: \"California has 8,200 confirmed cases. On a per-capita basis, that makes California about average among the states. However, that figure comes with a big caveat: California has only gotten results back for about 30,000 tests, and it says it has 57,400 test results pending. The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent. If the backlogged specimens are positive at a similar rate, it will add thousands of people to California's count of confirmed coronavirus carriers.

From arstechnica on 04/02: \"California has 8,200 confirmed cases. On a per-capita basis, that makes California about average among the states. However, that figure comes with a big caveat: California has only gotten results back for about 30,000 tests, and it says it has 57,400 test results pending. The tests returned so far have shown a positive rate of 27 percent. If the backlogged specimens are positive at a similar rate, it will add thousands of people to California's count of confirmed coronavirus carriers.

''Lisowicia'' is the largest known dicynodont, as well as the largest non-[[mammal]]ian synapsid, and is estimated to have weighed between 5\u20136 tons, comparable in size to modern [[elephant]]s. It was also one of the last dicynodonts, living shortly before their extinction at the end of the Triassic period. Fossils of a giant dicynodont were known from Poland since 2008, but ''Lisowicia'' was not named and officially described as a new species for another decade in late 2018.\n\n''Lisowicia'' is unique amongst dicynodonts for its erect posture with all four limbs held upright directly under its body. This is similar to the limbs of living mammals and [[dinosaur]]s, but unlike the sprawling and semi-erect postures typical of all other dicynodonts (and indeed all other non-mammalian synapsids), and shares many independently evolved features of its limbs with large mammals. ''Lisowicia'' was the largest animal in its environment, and was comparable in size and ecology to the [[herbivorous]] \"prosauropod\" [[sauropodomorphs]], which otherwise occupied the role of large high-browsing herbivores in most Late Triassic ecosystems. Prior to the discovery of ''Lisowicia'', dicynodonts were suggested to have been out-competed by sauropodomorphs and were incapable of achieving similarly large body sizes. ''Lisowicia'' may have evolved its large size in response to the absence of sauropodomorphs in its ecosystem in southern Poland, or alternatively may have acted as a direct competitor to them.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lisowicia bojani J..png|thumb|left|[[Life restoration]] with hypothetical skin covering]]\nAlthough very large for a dicynodont, ''Lisowicia'' still closely resembles other Triassic stahleckeriids, such as its close relative ''[[Placerias]]'' from North America. It was a heavily built quadruped with a rotund, barrel shaped body, a large head with beaked jaws and a short neck, stocky limbs, and a very short tail.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\">{{cite journal |last1=Sulej |first1=Tomasz |last2=Nied\u017awiedzki |first2=Grzegorz |title=An elephant-sized Late Triassic synapsid with erect limbs |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=363 |issue=6422 |pages=78\u201380 |date=4 January 2019|doi=10.1126/science.aal4853 |pmid=30467179 |language=en |issn=0036-8075}}</ref>\n\nThe skull is incomplete and known only from various isolated individual pieces, but they are enough to determine that it had a similar skull to other stahleckeriids. The [[temporal fenestra]] were large, and the back of the skull was drawn into a high crest between them, providing extensive jaw muscle attachment at the back of the skull. The snout was relatively elongate like in other stahleckeriids, and had a toothless [[tortoise]]-like beak at the front. Like some other Triassic dicynodonts, ''Lisowicia'' was completely toothless and lacked even the tusks typical of most dicynodonts. Instead, it had a pair of short and thick triangular projections from the [[maxilla]]ry jaw bone behind the beak called caniniform processes, similar to those of the related ''[[Ischigualastia]]'' and other stahleckeriids. Likewise, comparing the proportions of the [[quadrate bone]] at the back of the skull to those of ''Ischigualastia'' suggests that ''Lisowicia'' had a broad skull that was roughly {{convert|43|cm|in}} wide between each quadrate at the jaw joints.<ref name=DTA/>\n\nIts backbone and ribs are typical for dicynodonts, however, the [[cervical vertebra]]e of the neck are notable for having unusual hollows excavated into their sides. This is similar to the holes in some dinosaur vertebrae that are associated with a system of [[air sac]]s and a bird-like [[Respiratory system#Birds|respiratory system]]. However, unlike dinosaurs ''Lisowicia'' lacks openings in its vertebrae ([[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pleurocoel|pleurocoels]]) for air sacs and the interior of the vertebra is solid. This trait is unique to ''Lisowicia'' amongst dicynodonts, and its function is unclear. The bones of the [[pelvis]] and hind limb are very robust compared to other dicynodonts due to the massive size of the animal (e.g. the largest known [[femur]] is {{convert|80|cm|in}} long), but are otherwise similar to those of other stahleckeriids. Like other stahleckeriids, the hind legs were also held upright beneath the body.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n===Forelimbs===\n[[File:Life restoration of Lisowicia bojani (Szymon G\u00f3rnicki).jpg|thumb|Life restoration of Lisowicia bojani (Szymon G\u00f3rnicki)]]\nThe forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' are very distinctive amongst dicynodonts. Indeed, their construction is unique to not only the group, but to non-[[mammal]]ian [[synapsid]]s as a whole and shares features with the limbs of mammals and dinosaurs. The forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' are held completely erect under the body, with an elbow joint that is directed backwards and so only allows the forearm to swing forwards and backwards in a parasagittal gait. This arrangement is found in the hindlimbs of various other large Triassic [[Kannemeyeriiformes|kannemeyeriiforms]], but they all retain sprawling forelimbs with elbows bowed outwards and joints that allow the [[radius]] and [[ulna]] to rotate during each step in a sprawled posture.\n\nTo achieve this posture, the forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' had to undergo several prominent anatomical changes compared to the normal condition in dicynodonts. On the [[humerus]], the shoulder joint and the elbow are parallel to each other, unlike the rotated [[humerus]] of sprawling dicynodonts, and so the humerus is held upright beneath the shoulder and directly above the [[radius]] and the [[ulna]]. The forearm itself is also unusually short compared to other dicynodonts since the elbow is now positioned further down directly below the body and closer to the ground. The musculature of the forelimb has also been rearranged to facilitate its upright posture and gait, now functioning to draw the limb forwards and backwards and losing the ability to rotate the upper arm as it would in a sprawling stride.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Lisowicia NT.jpg|thumb|Size of ''Lisowicia'' compared to a human]]\nAlthough the skeleton is incomplete, the massive size of various elements of its skeleton indicate that ''Lisowicia'' was a very large animal, larger than any other dicynodont. From comparing its bones to other dicynodonts, its body length was estimated to be around {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} long and with a hip height of over {{convert|2|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"GM-20181122\">{{cite news |last=Dvorsky |first=George |title=During the Triassic, This Elephant-Sized Relative of Mammals Lived Alongside the Dinosaurs |url=https://gizmodo.com/during-the-triassic-this-elephant-sized-relative-of-ma-1830572760 |date=22 November 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=22 November 2018 }}</ref> Its body weight was initially calculated to be approximately 9.33 tons from the circumference of its femur and humerus\u2014a proxy for estimating how much weight the limbs needed to support. However, the shafts of these bones are disproportionately robust and thick in ''Lisowicia'', even for its size, and so its body weight was likely overestimated.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/><ref name='Resize'/>\n\nIts body weight was later more reliably estimated by modelling its mass from the estimated total volume of its body. These estimates varied depending on the girth of its [[rib cage]] and the amount of [[soft tissue]] modelled around the skeleton, with an overall average weight of 5.87 tons, and a lowermost estimate with minimal body fat and other tissues at 4.87 tons and a maximum of 7.02 tons at its bulkiest. This range is comparable to those of modern [[African elephant]]s, comfortably making ''Lisowicia'' the largest known non-mammalian synapsid and the biggest synapsid prior to the appearance of large mammals in the [[Eocene]] (such as the [[brontothere]]s). By comparison, the large [[dinocephalian]] ''[[Tapinocaninus]]'' was similarly estimated to weigh only {{convert|892|kg|lb}} on average.<ref name='Resize'>{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=Marco|last2=Manucci|first2=Fabio|date=2019-06-14|title=Resizing ''Lisowicia bojani'': volumetric body mass estimate and 3D reconstruction of the giant Late Triassic dicynodont|journal=[[Historical Biology]]|doi=10.1080/08912963.2019.1631819|issn=0891-2963|pages=1\u20136}}</ref><ref name='Tapino'>{{Cite journal|last=Romano|first=Marco|last2=Rubidge|first2=Bruce|date=2019|title=First 3D reconstruction and volumetric body mass estimate of the tapinocephalid dinocephalian ''Tapinocaninus pamelae'' (Synapsida: Therapsida)|journal=[[Historical Biology]]|doi=10.1080/08912963.2019.1640219|issn=1029-2381|pages=1\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Lisowice site.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the Lisowice site]] \nRemains of ''Lisowicia'' have been discovered in the Lipie \u015al\u0105skie clay pit in [[Lisowice, Silesian Voivodeship|Lisowice]], a village in southern Poland near the town of [[Lubliniec]], [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]]. The fossil bearing beds of Lipie \u015al\u0105skie consist mostly of green [[mudstone]]s. The age of the Lipie \u015al\u0105skie clay pit has been difficult to determine, with different [[biostratigraphic]] methods of dating providing varying results. The site has typically been dated to the [[Rhaetian]], which would make ''Lisowicia'' one of the youngest dicynodonts in the world. However, palaeontologists Grzegorz Racki and Spencer Lucas have claimed the site to be older and dated to the middle [[Norian]] [[Stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] based on biostratigraphy of large vertebrates, including ''Lisowicia''. They instead suggested ''Lisowicia'' was not significantly younger than other dicynodonts and was similar in age to the last known genera elsewhere in the world.<ref name='Biostrat'>{{cite journal |last1=Racki |first1=G. |last2=Lucas |first2=S.G. |year=2018 |title=Timing of dicynodont extinction in light of an unusual Late Triassic Polish fauna and Cuvier's approach to extinction |journal=[[Historical Biology]] |doi=10.1080/08912963.2018.1499734 |pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nA sample of [[Detrital_zircon_geochronology|detrital zircons]] from the Lipie \u015al\u0105skie clay pit was [[Radiometric_dating|radiometrically dated]] to determine the maximum age of deposition for the fossil beds.

The elephantine size of ''Lisowicia'' demonstrates that gigantism also evolved in dicynodonts, and analysis of their body size as they evolved over the course of the Late Triassic demonstrates that, like sauropodomorphs, Triassic dicynodonts were also increasing in body size, culminating in ''Lisowicia''. In fact, dicynodonts were consistently larger than sauropodomorphs during the [[Carnian]] stage, and both achieved similar gigantic sizes in the [[Norian]] to the [[Rhaetian]] with ''Lisowicia''. The evolution of gigantism in both sauropodomorphs and ''Lisowicia'' at similar time periods suggests that ecological factors may have allowed and encouraged both lineages to grow to giant sizes, as opposed to specific traits inherent to sauropodomorph dinosaurs as had previously been suggested.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\nThe evolution of gigantism in dicynodonts was a gradual process, occurring over approximately 20 million years, and acquired major restructuring the musculo-skeletal system to achieve the size and posture of ''Lisowicia''.  It's possible that gigantism in ''Liwosicia'' was driven by increasing body size in predators, or as a metabolic adaptation for getting more nutrition out of their food by increasing the size of their gut.<ref name='coprolites'/><ref name=\"Smok\"/> It also highlights that dicynodont evolution in the Late Triassic is still poorly understood. Previously considered to be geographically restricted and in decline, ''Lisowicia'' demonstrates that dicynodonts were both still geographically widespread and continuing to diversify in the Late Triassic, particularly evolving traits to support massive body sizes.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n===Feeding and diet===\n''Lisowicia'' was a herbivore, like most other dicynodonts, using its relatively long beak to crop and chew, although its large size implies it was feeding on higher levels of vegetation than was typical for the group. [[Coprolite]]s attributed to ''Lisowicia'' indicate that it mostly ate soft vegetation and [[conifers]]. However, some coprolites contain large portions of woody material, a trait observed in some other dicynodont coprolites. This has been suggested to represent seasonal variation in its diet, possibly when their preferred diet of soft vegetation was out of season.<ref name='coprolites'>{{cite journal |last1=Bajdek |first1=P. |last2=Owocki |first2=K. |last3=Nied\u017awiedzk |first3=G |year=2014 |title=Putative dicynodont coprolites from the Upper Triassic of Poland |journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]] |volume=411 |pages=1\u201317 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.06.013}}</ref>\n\n===Predation===\n[[File:Smok with prey animals.jpg|thumb|''[[Smok (archosaur)|Smok]]'' (far left) with prey animals, including ''Lisowicia'' (far right), as inferred from [[coprolite]] contents and bones with bite marks]]\nBite marks have been found on the bones of ''Lisowicia'' that match the teeth of the contemporary predatory [[archosaur]] ''[[Smok (archosaur)|Smok]]'', and dicynodont bone fragments have also been identified in its proposed coprolites, implying that ''Lisowicia'' was a major component in the predator's diet.

However, while the growth rate of other dicynodonts slowed down as they grew, the studied bones of ''Lisowicia'' showed no such signs of slowing their growth. The possibility that the bones belonged to juveniles with an even larger adult body size than estimated was ruled out partly on the basis of their already massive size, but also because the bones were well ossified and developmentally mature. Instead, it's more likely that ''Lisowicia'' grew very rapidly without any interruptions until reaching their adult body size, as there was no clear lines of arrested growth (LAGs) that otherwise indicate periods of slower, reduced growth. LAGs may have been truly absent, or were possibly erased by extensive remodelling of the bone into adulthood, both of which would support permanently rapid growth in ''Lisowicia'', similar to mammals and some dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/><ref name=cousin/>\n\n===Latrines===\nCoprolites attributed to ''Lisowicia'' have been discovered in abundant accumulations in areas believed to have been around standing water.

''Lisowicia'' is the largest known dicynodont, as well as the largest non-[[mammal]]ian synapsid, and is estimated to have weighed between 5\u20136 tons, comparable in size to modern [[elephant]]s. It was also one of the last dicynodonts, living shortly before their extinction at the end of the Triassic period. Fossils of a giant dicynodont were known from Poland since 2008, but ''Lisowicia'' was not named and officially described as a new species for another decade in late 2018.\n\n''Lisowicia'' is unique amongst dicynodonts for its erect posture with all four limbs held upright directly under its body. This is similar to the limbs of living mammals and [[dinosaur]]s, but unlike the sprawling and semi-erect postures typical of all other dicynodonts (and indeed all other non-mammalian synapsids), and shares many independently evolved features of its limbs with large mammals. ''Lisowicia'' was the largest animal in its environment, and was comparable in size and ecology to the [[herbivorous]] \"prosauropod\" [[sauropodomorphs]], which otherwise occupied the role of large high-browsing herbivores in most Late Triassic ecosystems. Prior to the discovery of ''Lisowicia'', dicynodonts were suggested to have been out-competed by sauropodomorphs and were incapable of achieving similarly large body sizes. ''Lisowicia'' may have evolved its large size in response to the absence of sauropodomorphs in its ecosystem in southern Poland, or alternatively may have acted as a direct competitor to them.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Lisowicia bojani J..png|thumb|left|[[Life restoration]] with hypothetical skin covering]]\nAlthough very large for a dicynodont, ''Lisowicia'' still closely resembles other Triassic stahleckeriids, such as its close relative ''[[Placerias]]'' from North America. It was a heavily built quadruped with a rotund, barrel shaped body, a large head with beaked jaws and a short neck, stocky limbs, and a very short tail.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\">{{cite journal |last1=Sulej |first1=Tomasz |last2=Nied\u017awiedzki |first2=Grzegorz |title=An elephant-sized Late Triassic synapsid with erect limbs |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=363 |issue=6422 |pages=78\u201380 |date=4 January 2019|doi=10.1126/science.aal4853 |pmid=30467179 |language=en |issn=0036-8075}}</ref>\n\nThe skull is incomplete and known only from various isolated individual pieces, but they are enough to determine that it had a similar skull to other stahleckeriids. The [[temporal fenestra]] were large, and the back of the skull was drawn into a high crest between them, providing extensive jaw muscle attachment at the back of the skull. The snout was relatively elongate like in other stahleckeriids, and had a toothless [[tortoise]]-like beak at the front. Like some other Triassic dicynodonts, ''Lisowicia'' was completely toothless and lacked even the tusks typical of most dicynodonts. Instead, it had a pair of short and thick triangular projections from the [[maxilla]]ry jaw bone behind the beak called caniniform processes, similar to those of the related ''[[Ischigualastia]]'' and other stahleckeriids. Likewise, comparing the proportions of the [[quadrate bone]] at the back of the skull to those of ''Ischigualastia'' suggests that ''Lisowicia'' had a broad skull that was roughly {{convert|43|cm|in}} wide between each quadrate at the jaw joints.<ref name=DTA/>\n\nIts backbone and ribs are typical for dicynodonts, however, the [[cervical vertebra]]e of the neck are notable for having unusual hollows excavated into their sides. This is similar to the holes in some dinosaur vertebrae that are associated with a system of [[air sac]]s and a bird-like [[Respiratory system#Birds|respiratory system]]. However, unlike dinosaurs ''Lisowicia'' lacks openings in its vertebrae ([[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pleurocoel|pleurocoels]]) for air sacs and the interior of the vertebra is solid. This trait is unique to ''Lisowicia'' amongst dicynodonts, and its function is unclear. The bones of the [[pelvis]] and hind limb are very robust compared to other dicynodonts due to the massive size of the animal (e.g. the largest known [[femur]] is {{convert|80|cm|in}} long), but are otherwise similar to those of other stahleckeriids. Like other stahleckeriids, the hind legs were also held upright beneath the body.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n===Forelimbs===\nThe forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' are very distinctive amongst dicynodonts. Indeed, their construction is unique to not only the group, but to non-[[mammal]]ian [[synapsid]]s as a whole and shares features with the limbs of mammals and dinosaurs. The forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' are held completely erect under the body, with an elbow joint that is directed backwards and so only allows the forearm to swing forwards and backwards in a parasagittal gait. This arrangement is found in the hindlimbs of various other large Triassic [[Kannemeyeriiformes|kannemeyeriiforms]], but they all retain sprawling forelimbs with elbows bowed outwards and joints that allow the [[radius]] and [[ulna]] to rotate during each step in a sprawled posture.\n\nTo achieve this posture, the forelimbs of ''Lisowicia'' had to undergo several prominent anatomical changes compared to the normal condition in dicynodonts. On the [[humerus]], the shoulder joint and the elbow are parallel to each other, unlike the rotated [[humerus]] of sprawling dicynodonts, and so the humerus is held upright beneath the shoulder and directly above the [[radius]] and the [[ulna]]. The forearm itself is also unusually short compared to other dicynodonts since the elbow is now positioned further down directly below the body and closer to the ground. The musculature of the forelimb has also been rearranged to facilitate its upright posture and gait, now functioning to draw the limb forwards and backwards and losing the ability to rotate the upper arm as it would in a sprawling stride.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n===Size===\n[[File:Lisowicia NT.jpg|thumb|Size of ''Lisowicia'' compared to a human]]\nAlthough the skeleton is incomplete, the massive size of various elements of its skeleton indicate that ''Lisowicia'' was a very large animal, larger than any other dicynodont. From comparing its bones to other dicynodonts, its body length was estimated to be around {{convert|4.5|m|ft}} long and with a hip height of over {{convert|2|m|ft}}.<ref name=\"GM-20181122\">{{cite news |last=Dvorsky |first=George |title=During the Triassic, This Elephant-Sized Relative of Mammals Lived Alongside the Dinosaurs |url=https://gizmodo.com/during-the-triassic-this-elephant-sized-relative-of-ma-1830572760 |date=22 November 2018 |work=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=22 November 2018 }}</ref> Its body weight was initially calculated to be approximately 9.33 tons from the circumference of its femur and humerus\u2014a proxy for estimating how much weight the limbs needed to support.

These estimates varied depending on the girth of its [[rib cage]] and the amount of [[soft tissue]] modelled around the skeleton, with an overall average weight of 5.87 tons, and a lowermost estimate with minimal body fat and other tissues at 4.87 tons and a maximum of 7.02 tons at its bulkiest. This range is comparable to those of modern [[African elephant]]s, comfortably making ''Lisowicia'' the largest known non-mammalian synapsid and the biggest synapsid prior to the appearance of large mammals in the [[Eocene]] (such as the [[brontothere]]s).

A simplified cladogram from one of the analysis focused on the relationships of Stahleckeriidae is reproduced below:\n{{clade|style=font-size:85%; line-height:85%\n|label1=[[Stahleckeriidae]]\n|1={{clade\n |label1=[[Stahleckeriinae]]\n |1={{clade\n  |1=''[[Zambiasaurus]]'' \n  |2={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n    |1=''[[Ischigualastia]]'' [[File:Ischigualastia.jpg|80px]]\n    |2=''[[Jachaleria]]'' }}\n   |2={{clade\n    |1=''[[Eubrachiosaurus]]''\n    |2={{clade\n     |1=''[[Sangusaurus]]''\n     |2=''[[Stahleckeria]]'' [[File:Stahleckeria1DB.jpg|80px]] }} }} }} }}\n |label2=[[Placeriinae]]\n |2={{clade\n  |1='''''Lisowicia''''' [[File:Lisowicia bojani J..png|80px]]\n  |2={{clade\n   |1=''[[Placerias]]'' [[File:Placerias1DB.jpg|80px]] \n   |2=''[[Moghreberia]]''\n}} }} }} }}\n\n===Dicynodont gigantism and evolution===\n[[File:Fosiln\u00ed kost dicynodonta.jpg|thumb|upright|Mounted fossil [[humerus]] of ''Lisowicia'']]\nPrior to the discovery of ''Lisowicia'', the evolution of giant body sizes in Triassic sauropodomorphs was thought to be an exclusive trait of dinosaurs, as other large herbivores\u2014including the dicynodonts\u2014were not thought to have achieved similar sizes. The elephantine size of ''Lisowicia'' demonstrates that gigantism also evolved in dicynodonts, and analysis of their body size as they evolved over the course of the Late Triassic demonstrates that, like sauropodomorphs, Triassic dicynodonts were also increasing in body size, culminating in ''Lisowicia''. In fact, dicynodonts were consistently larger than sauropodomorphs during the [[Carnian]] stage, and both achieved similar gigantic sizes in the [[Norian]] to the [[Rhaetian]] with ''Lisowicia''. The evolution of gigantism in both sauropodomorphs and ''Lisowicia'' at similar time periods suggests that ecological factors may have allowed and encouraged both lineages to grow to giant sizes, as opposed to specific traits inherent to sauropodomorph dinosaurs as had previously been suggested.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\nThe evolution of gigantism in dicynodonts was a gradual process, occurring over approximately 20 million years, and acquired major restructuring the musculo-skeletal system to achieve the size and posture of ''Lisowicia''.  It's possible that gigantism in ''Liwosicia'' was driven by increasing body size in predators, or as a metabolic adaptation for getting more nutrition out of their food by increasing the size of their gut.<ref name='coprolites'/><ref name=\"Smok\"/> It also highlights that dicynodont evolution in the Late Triassic is still poorly understood. Previously considered to be geographically restricted and in decline, ''Lisowicia'' demonstrates that dicynodonts were both still geographically widespread and continuing to diversify in the Late Triassic, particularly evolving traits to support massive body sizes.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/>\n\n==Palaeobiology==\n===Feeding and diet===\n''Lisowicia'' was a herbivore, like most other dicynodonts, using its relatively long beak to crop and chew, although its large size implies it was feeding on higher levels of vegetation than was typical for the group. [[Coprolite]]s attributed to ''Lisowicia'' indicate that it mostly ate soft vegetation and [[conifers]]. However, some coprolites contain large portions of woody material, a trait observed in some other dicynodont coprolites. This has been suggested to represent seasonal variation in its diet, possibly when their preferred diet of soft vegetation was out of season.<ref name='coprolites'>{{cite journal |last1=Bajdek |first1=P. |last2=Owocki |first2=K. |last3=Nied\u017awiedzk |first3=G |year=2014 |title=Putative dicynodont coprolites from the Upper Triassic of Poland |journal=[[Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology]] |volume=411 |pages=1\u201317 |doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2014.06.013}}</ref>\n\n===Predation===\n[[File:Smok with prey animals.jpg|thumb|''[[Smok (archosaur)|Smok]]'' (far left) with prey animals, including ''Lisowicia'' (far right), as inferred from [[coprolite]] contents and bones with bite marks]]\nBite marks have been found on the bones of ''Lisowicia'' that match the teeth of the contemporary predatory [[archosaur]] ''[[Smok (archosaur)|Smok]]'', and dicynodont bone fragments have also been identified in its proposed coprolites, implying that ''Lisowicia'' was a major component in the predator's diet. The majority of the bite marks are found on juvenile specimens of ''Lisowicia'', and this preponderance was suggested to indicate that the juvenile ''Lisowicia'' were preferentially hunted by ''Smok'' and that they represent active predation and not just scavenged remains.<ref name=\"Smok\">{{cite journal |last1=Nied\u017awiedzki |first1=G. |last2=Gorzelak |first2=P. |last3=Sulej |first3=T. |year=2011 |title=Bite traces on dicynodont bones and the early evolution of large terrestrial predators |journal=[[Lethaia]] |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=87\u201392 |doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.2010.00227.x}}</ref><ref name=\"Qvarnstrom2019\">{{cite journal |title=Tyrannosaurid-like osteophagy by a Triassic archosaur |last1=Qvarnstr\u00f6m |first1=Martin |last2=Ahlberg |first2=Per E. |last3=Nied\u017awiedzki |first3=Grzegorz |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |year=2019 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=925 |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-37540-4|pmid=30700743 |pmc=6353991}}</ref>\n\n===Growth===\n[[Histological]] studies from the limb bones of ''Lisowicia'' showed features characteristic of a rapid growth rate as juveniles, similar to other large dicynodonts. However, while the growth rate of other dicynodonts slowed down as they grew, the studied bones of ''Lisowicia'' showed no such signs of slowing their growth. The possibility that the bones belonged to juveniles with an even larger adult body size than estimated was ruled out partly on the basis of their already massive size, but also because the bones were well ossified and developmentally mature. Instead, it's more likely that ''Lisowicia'' grew very rapidly without any interruptions until reaching their adult body size, as there was no clear lines of arrested growth (LAGs) that otherwise indicate periods of slower, reduced growth. LAGs may have been truly absent, or were possibly erased by extensive remodelling of the bone into adulthood, both of which would support permanently rapid growth in ''Lisowicia'', similar to mammals and some dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Lisowicia\"/><ref name=cousin/>\n\n===Latrines===\nCoprolites attributed to ''Lisowicia'' have been discovered in abundant accumulations in areas believed to have been around standing water. These assemblages are similar to discoveries in [[Brazil]] believed to represent [[Animal latrine|communal latrines]] made by the dicynodont ''[[Dinodontosaurus]]'', and it's possible that ''Lisowicia'' may have performed a similar behaviour. Communal latrines are documented in modern gregarious mammals, and supports the idea that dicynodonts like ''Lisowicia'' lived in herds and even suggests that they had complex social behaviours like modern large mammals.<ref name='coprolites'/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fiorelli |first1=L.E. |last2=Ezcurra |first2=M.D. |last3=Hechenleitner |first3=E.M. |last4=Arga\u00f1araz |first4=E |last5=Taborda |first5=J.R.A. |last6=Trotteyn |first6=M.J. |last7=von Baczko |first7=M.B. |last8=Desojo |first8=J.B. |year=2013 |title=The oldest known communal latrines provide evidence of gregarism in Triassic megaherbivores |journal=[[Scientific Reports]] |volume=3 |issue=3348 |doi=10.1038/srep03348}}</ref>\n\n==Palaeoecology==\n[[File:Lisowice site fauna.jpg|thumb|Drawing of the vertebrate faunal assemblage of the Lisowice site]] \n''Lisowicia'' coexisted with a broad variety of Late Triassic animals in Lipie \u015al\u0105skie.
