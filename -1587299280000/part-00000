The Canadiens would return to the Finals for a third straight time in [[1966-67 NHL season|1966-67]]. However, Rousseau and his team could not accomplish the three-peat as they were beaten by the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] in 6 games. This did not matter to the Canadiens and Rousseau, as they made the finals for the next 2 seasons, winning the Stanley Cup both times.\n\nAfter 9 seasons, with the Canadiens, and following a 24-goal performance the [[1969-70 NHL season|previous season]], Rousseau was traded to the [[Minnesota North Stars]] where he spent the [[1970-71 NHL season|1970-71 season]]. After just one season with the North Stars, he was traded to the [[New York Rangers]] in exchange for [[right winger]] [[Bob Nevin]]. Rousseau helped the Rangers reach the Stanley Cup Finals in [[1971-72 NHL season|1971-72]]. Rousseau had a total of 17 points during the Rangers' run as they lost the Stanley Cup in 6 games to the [[Boston Bruins]]. After playing 2 more seasons with the Rangers, Rousseau retired after playing 8 games in [[1974-75 NHL season|1974-75]].\n\n==Personal life==\nRousseau is the brother of former NHL players [[Rollie Rousseau|Rollie]] and [[Guy Rousseau]].\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n*[[Memorial Cup]] champion \u2014 [[1958 Memorial Cup|1958]] (with the [[Hull-Ottawa Canadiens]])\n*[[Eastern Professional Hockey League (1959-1963)|EPHL]] Second All-Star Team \u2014 1961\n*[[Calder Memorial Trophy]] \u2014 [[1961\u201362 NHL season|1962]]\n*[[NHL All-Star Game]]s \u2014 [[19th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1965]], [[20th National Hockey League All-Star Game|1967]], [[22nd National Hockey League All-Star Game|1969]]\n*[[NHL Second All-Star Team]] \u2014 [[1965-66 NHL season|1966]]\n*[[Stanley Cup]] champion \u2014 [[1965 Stanley Cup Finals|1965]], [[1966 Stanley Cup Finals|1966]], [[1968 Stanley Cup Finals|1968]], [[1969 Stanley Cup Finals|1969]] (with the [[Montreal Canadiens]])\n*On February 1, 1964, Rousseau scored 5 goals in one game and became [[List of players with five or more goals in an NHL game|one of 44 players in the NHL]] to score 5 or more goals in one game.\n\n==Career statistics==\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[regular season|Regular&nbsp;season]]\n! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | &nbsp;\n! colspan=\"5\" | [[Playoffs]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!
