The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.\n[[File:WS1359-10-N-Downtown-HanfordCA-1877-1.png|thumb|Hanford in 1877. Resident J.T.

Hanford's namesake was [[James Madison Hanford]], an executive for the company.

[https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/LTLL-CT8 Wayman Leftrick Pryor], being one of the \"Mussel Slough Five\" and in the census, was also probably the only confirmed landowner from the incident in today's Hanford.

The area was inhabited by the Tachi [[Yokut people|Yokut]] Indians for several thousand years prior to Euro-American contact. They occupied locations along watercourses such as creeks, springs and seep areas (such as [[Slough (hydrology)|sloughs]]), along perennial and seasonal drainages, as well as flat ridges and terraces.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Hanford Mall'', Earth Metrics Inc. for the city of Hanford and State of California Clearinghouse, rpt. 10082, March 8, 1990</ref> Therefore, places along streams are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on an elevation above the seasonal flood levels.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.  [[Bangalore]], [[Chennai]], [[Hyderabad]], [[Kochi]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Visakhapatnam]],  [[Coimbatore]] , [[Mysore]], [[Kozhikode]], [[Madurai]], [[Mangalore]], [[Tiruchirappalli]], [[Warangal]] are some of the major cities.\n\nThe majority of the people in South India speak one of the four major [[Dravidian languages]]: [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Kannada]]  and [[Malayalam]]. During its [[History of South India|history]], a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India whose invasions across [[South Asia|southern]] and [[Southeast Asia|southeastern]] Asia impacted the history and culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the [[Chera dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]], [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]], [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]], [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]], [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] and [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]]. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states. [[Literacy in India|Literacy rates]] in the southern states are higher than the national average with approximately 81% of the population capable of reading and writing.

Covering the southern part of the [[peninsula]]r [[Deccan Plateau]], South India is bounded by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, the [[Arabian Sea]] in the west and the [[Indian Ocean]] in the south. The geography of the region is diverse with two mountain ranges - the [[Western Ghats|Western]] and [[Eastern Ghats]], bordering the [[plateau]] heartland. [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]], [[Kaveri River|Kaveri]], [[Tungabhadra River|Tungabhadra]] and [[Vaigai River|Vaigai]] rivers are important non-[[Perennial stream|perennial]] sources of water.

European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was [[colonialism|colonised]] by [[British East India|Britain]] and other Western European countries.\n\nAfter experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]], the economies of South Indian states have registered higher than national average growth over the past three decades.  While South Indian states have improved in some [[socio-economics|socio-economic]] metrics, poverty continues to affect the region much like the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. [[Human Development Index|HDI]] in the southern states is high and the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than most northern states.

It is situated in the central part of the Republika Srpska, on the banks of [[Usora River]]. As of 2013, the town has a population of 7,518 inhabitants, while the municipality has 38,536 inhabitants.\n\nAbout {{cvt|5|km}} to the south-east from the city center there is a location of medieval [[tombstones of Duke Mom\u010dilo]]. Also, [[Solila, Borja|Solila]] is located on the [[Borja (mountain)|Borja Mountain]].\n\n==History==\nThe town was settled in the 19th century with the first industrialization of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Main industries are wood products and the chemical industry. Long before Tesli\u010b began to rise a nearby village called [[\u010ce\u010dava]] existed as one of the oldest places people inhabited, there is archaeological evidence that \u010ce\u010dava existed as early as the 10th century.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Tesli\u0107 was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nTesli\u0107 was until the late 1950s among the largest industrial centers in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Today Tesli\u010b industry is mostly based on the production of wood, milk, clothing, telecommunications, electro industry, metallic industry and building construction.\n\nTesli\u010b is also known as a tourist destination, mainly because of the Banja Vru\u0107ica, \u0430 health spa for healing cardio-vascular diseases. With a complex of five hotels and a capacity of over 1000 beds, Banja Vru\u0107ica has the biggest tourist capacity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The nearby mountain [[Borja (mountain)|Borja]] is an attractive tourist destination with two hotels and sports facilities.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality of Tesli\u0107 has a population of 38,536 inhabitants.\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Tesli\u0107 municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1938.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|35,933\n|39,764\n|\n|52,713\n|60,434\n|59,854\n|38,536\n|-\n|1\n|Banja Vru\u0107ica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,637\n|2,181\n|-\n|2\n|Bardaci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|653\n|288\n|-\n|3\n|Bari\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,151\n|1,350\n|-\n|4\n|Bijelo Bu\u010dje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,642\n|483\n|-\n|5\n|Blatnica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,890\n|1,231\n|-\n|6\n|Buleti\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,419\n|1,588\n|-\n|7\n|\u010ce\u010dava\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,616\n|1,581\n|-\n|8\n|Donji O\u010dau\u0161\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|328\n|257\n|-\n|9\n|Donji Rankovi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|963\n|910\n|-\n|10\n|Donji Ru\u017eevi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,060\n|1,310\n|-\n|11\n|\u0110uli\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,512\n|2,086\n|-\n|12\n|Gomjenica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|970\n|582\n|-\n|13\n|Gornja Radnja\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,033\n|530\n|-\n|14\n|Gornja Vru\u0107ica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,590\n|387\n|-\n|15\n|Gornje Liplje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|698\n|475\n|-\n|16\n|Gornji O\u010dau\u0161\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|959\n|526\n|-\n|17\n|Gornji Rankovi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,249\n|754\n|-\n|18\n|Gornji Ru\u017eevi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|661\n|469\n|-\n|19\n|Gornji Tesli\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,489\n|1,885\n|-\n|20\n|Jasenova\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|662\n|216\n|-\n|21\n|Kamenica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,667\n|1,300\n|-\n|22\n|Mladikovine\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|2,406\n|1,435\n|-\n|23\n|Osivica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,214\n|607\n|-\n|24\n|Pribini\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,996\n|1,298\n|-\n|25\n|Rade\u0161i\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|489\n|231\n|-\n|26\n|Raj\u0161eva\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|763\n|356\n|-\n|27\n|Rastu\u0161a\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,266\n|592\n|-\n|28\n|Rudo Polje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|543\n|740\n|-\n|29\n|\u0160njegotina Gornja\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|909\n|538\n|-\n|30\n|Stenjak\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,740\n|1,071\n|-\n|31\n|'''Tesli\u0107'''\n|\n|\n|3,803\n|4,874\n|6,660\n|8,655\n|7,518\n|-\n|32\n|Ugodnovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|927\n|448\n|-\n|33\n|Ukrinica\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,159\n|649\n|-\n|34\n|Vitkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|1,307\n|786\n|-\n|35\n|Vlaji\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|839\n|329\n|-\n|36\n|\u017darkovina\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|486\n|313\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Tesli\u0107 town\n|-\n|Nationality\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|7,518 (100,0%)\n|8,655 (100,0%)\n|6,660 (100,0%)\n|4,874 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|3,571 (41,26%)\n|2,465 (37,01%)\n|1,951 (40,03%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|1,987 (22,96%)\n|1,557 (23,38%)\n|69 (1,416%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|1,889 (21,83%)\n|1 568 (23,54%)\n|1,595 (32,72%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|766 (8,850%)\n|954 (14,32%)\n|1,103 (22,63%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|442 (5,107%)\n|57 (0,856%)\n|102 (2,093%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|51 (0,766%)\n|34 (0,698%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|7 (0,105%)\n|10 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,015%)\n|1 (0,021%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|\n|9 (0,185%)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Tesli\u0107 municipality\n|-\n|Nationality\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|38,536 (100,0%)\n|59,854 (100,0%)\n|60,434 (100,0%)\n|52,713 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|29,041 (75,36%)\n|32,962 (55,07%)\n|35,024 (57,95%)\n|32,756 (62,14%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|7184 (18,64%)\n|12,802 (21,39%)\n|11,148 (18,45%)\n|10,000 (18,97%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|1,442 (3,742%)\n|9,525 (15,91%)\n|10,744 (17,78%)\n|9,467 (17,96%)\n|-\n|Others\n|869 (2,255%)\n|1,100 (1,838%)\n|204 (0,338%)\n|285 (0,541%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|3 465 (5,789%)\n|3 155 (5,221%)\n|108 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|93 (0,154%)\n|67 (0,127%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|\n|\n|43 (0,071%)\n|\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|8 (0,013%)\n|18 (0,034%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|8 (0,013%)\n|9 (0,017%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|7 (0,012%)\n|3 (0,006%)\n|}\n[[File:Panorama Teslic.jpg|center|thumb|1668x1668px|Panoram of Tesli\u0107]]\n<br />\n==Economy==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

Long before Tesli\u010b began to rise a nearby village called [[\u010ce\u010dava]] existed as one of the oldest places people inhabited, there is archaeological evidence that \u010ce\u010dava existed as early as the 10th century.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Tesli\u0107 was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nTesli\u0107 was until the late 1950s among the largest industrial centers in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Today Tesli\u010b industry is mostly based on the production of wood, milk, clothing, telecommunications, electro industry, metallic industry and building construction.\n\nTesli\u010b is also known as a tourist destination, mainly because of the Banja Vru\u0107ica, \u0430 health spa for healing cardio-vascular diseases. With a complex of five hotels and a capacity of over 1000 beds, Banja Vru\u0107ica has the biggest tourist capacity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The nearby mountain [[Borja (mountain)|Borja]] is an attractive tourist destination with two hotels and sports facilities.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n| type = \n| percentages = pagr\n|1948|35933 |1953|39764 |1971|52713 |1981|60434 |1991|60708 |2013|38536\n}}\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality of Tesli\u0107 has a population of 38,536 inhabitants.\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Tesli\u0107 municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|\n|52,713\n|60,434\n|59,854\n|38,536\n|-\n|1\n|Banja Vru\u0107ica\n|\n|\n|\n|2,637\n|2,181\n|-\n|2\n|Bardaci\n|\n|\n|\n|653\n|288\n|-\n|3\n|Bari\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,151\n|1,350\n|-\n|4\n|Bijelo Bu\u010dje\n|\n|\n|\n|1,642\n|483\n|-\n|5\n|Blatnica\n|\n|\n|\n|2,890\n|1,231\n|-\n|6\n|Buleti\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|2,419\n|1,588\n|-\n|7\n|\u010ce\u010dava\n|\n|\n|\n|2,616\n|1,581\n|-\n|8\n|Donji O\u010dau\u0161\n|\n|\n|\n|328\n|257\n|-\n|9\n|Donji Rankovi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|963\n|910\n|-\n|10\n|Donji Ru\u017eevi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|2,060\n|1,310\n|-\n|11\n|\u0110uli\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,512\n|2,086\n|-\n|12\n|Gomjenica\n|\n|\n|\n|970\n|582\n|-\n|13\n|Gornja Radnja\n|\n|\n|\n|1,033\n|530\n|-\n|14\n|Gornja Vru\u0107ica\n|\n|\n|\n|1,590\n|387\n|-\n|15\n|Gornje Liplje\n|\n|\n|\n|698\n|475\n|-\n|16\n|Gornji O\u010dau\u0161\n|\n|\n|\n|959\n|526\n|-\n|17\n|Gornji Rankovi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|1,249\n|754\n|-\n|18\n|Gornji Ru\u017eevi\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|661\n|469\n|-\n|19\n|Gornji Tesli\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|1,489\n|1,885\n|-\n|20\n|Jasenova\n|\n|\n|\n|662\n|216\n|-\n|21\n|Kamenica\n|\n|\n|\n|1,667\n|1,300\n|-\n|22\n|Mladikovine\n|\n|\n|\n|2,406\n|1,435\n|-\n|23\n|Osivica\n|\n|\n|\n|1,214\n|607\n|-\n|24\n|Pribini\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|1,996\n|1,298\n|-\n|25\n|Rade\u0161i\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|489\n|231\n|-\n|26\n|Raj\u0161eva\n|\n|\n|\n|763\n|356\n|-\n|27\n|Rastu\u0161a\n|\n|\n|\n|1,266\n|592\n|-\n|28\n|Rudo Polje\n|\n|\n|\n|543\n|740\n|-\n|29\n|\u0160njegotina Gornja\n|\n|\n|\n|909\n|538\n|-\n|30\n|Stenjak\n|\n|\n|\n|1,740\n|1,071\n|-\n|31\n|'''Tesli\u0107'''\n|3,803\n|4,874\n|6,660\n|8,655\n|7,518\n|-\n|32\n|Ugodnovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|927\n|448\n|-\n|33\n|Ukrinica\n|\n|\n|\n|1,159\n|649\n|-\n|34\n|Vitkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,307\n|786\n|-\n|35\n|Vlaji\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|839\n|329\n|-\n|36\n|\u017darkovina\n|\n|\n|\n|486\n|313\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Tesli\u0107 town\n|-\n|Nationality\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|7,518 (100,0%)\n|8,655 (100,0%)\n|6,660 (100,0%)\n|4,874 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|\n|3,571 (41,26%)\n|2,465 (37,01%)\n|1,951 (40,03%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|1,987 (22,96%)\n|1,557 (23,38%)\n|69 (1,416%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|\n|1,889 (21,83%)\n|1 568 (23,54%)\n|1,595 (32,72%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|\n|766 (8,850%)\n|954 (14,32%)\n|1,103 (22,63%)\n|-\n|Others\n|\n|442 (5,107%)\n|57 (0,856%)\n|102 (2,093%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|51 (0,766%)\n|34 (0,698%)\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|7 (0,105%)\n|10 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|1 (0,015%)\n|1 (0,021%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|\n|9 (0,185%)\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"8\" |Ethnic composition \u2013 Tesli\u0107 municipality\n|-\n|Nationality\n|2013.\n|1991.\n|1981.\n|1971.\n|-\n|Total\n|38,536 (100,0%)\n|59,854 (100,0%)\n|60,434 (100,0%)\n|52,713 (100,0%)\n|-\n|Serbs\n|29,041 (75,36%)\n|32,962 (55,07%)\n|35,024 (57,95%)\n|32,756 (62,14%)\n|-\n|Bosniaks\n|7184 (18,64%)\n|12,802 (21,39%)\n|11,148 (18,45%)\n|10,000 (18,97%)\n|-\n|Croats\n|1,442 (3,742%)\n|9,525 (15,91%)\n|10,744 (17,78%)\n|9,467 (17,96%)\n|-\n|Others\n|869 (2,255%)\n|1,100 (1,838%)\n|204 (0,338%)\n|285 (0,541%)\n|-\n|Yugoslavs\n|\n|3 465 (5,789%)\n|3 155 (5,221%)\n|108 (0,205%)\n|-\n|Montenegrins\n|\n|\n|93 (0,154%)\n|67 (0,127%)\n|-\n|Roma\n|\n|\n|43 (0,071%)\n|\n|-\n|Slovenes\n|\n|\n|8 (0,013%)\n|18 (0,034%)\n|-\n|Albanians\n|\n|\n|8 (0,013%)\n|9 (0,017%)\n|-\n|Macedonians\n|\n|\n|7 (0,012%)\n|3 (0,006%)\n|}\n<br />\n==Economy==\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!
