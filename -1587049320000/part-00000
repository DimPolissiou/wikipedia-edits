From fall 1968 through spring 1971, the school was temporarily located at the site of the current Orchard Lake Middle School.  The current building was built in 1971.  West Bloomfield High School has begun to offer the Advanced Placement International Diploma to the classes of 2011 and beyond.  In addition, it established additional Advanced Placement courses starting the 2010-2011 school year.\n\nThe school has been recognized by [[Newsweek]] magazine as being in the top 6% of U.S. public high schools.<ref name=\"official\">[http://web.westbloomfield.k12.mi.us/wbhs/index.html West Bloomfield High School official web site], retrieved 2008-05-28  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030928180806/http://web.westbloomfield.k12.mi.us/wbhs/index.html |date=September 28, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n==Building==\nIn 1986, the district responded to growing enrollment by building a new high school. The large, single-story building was designed in a U-shape around a courtyard that faced Orchard Lake Road. In the late 1990s, the courtyard was enclosed by a 2-story addition that gave the school its curved front facade. In 2000, the media center was completely rebuilt with an emphasis on technology.<ref>[http://www.peterli.com/spm/resources/articles/archive.php?article_id=502] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904035515/http://www.peterli.com/spm/resources/articles/archive.php?article_id=502 |date=September 4, 2009 }}</ref> Small additions have been built throughout the 2000s. \n\nBetween 1955 and 1966, WBHS was housed in the building that is now Abbott Middle School.\nBetween fall 1967 and spring 1971, WBHS occupied the building that now houses Orchard Lake Middle School.\n\n==Instructional Project Design program==\nThe school is known for its Instructional Project Design course, based on the philosophy that students must be allowed a say in designing tools that they will use. The tools in question are internet forums and services created for a variety of educational and civic clients. The program is run by the [[University of Michigan]]'s Flint, MI campus.\n\nThe program was responsible for the creation of \"Warren Easton in Exile,\" a noted website designed to virtually \"rebuild\" a high school in [[New Orleans]] that was shut down after being damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. Former projects also include the Michigan Student Caucus (formerly the Michigan Youth Caucus), a partnership with the Michigan State House Special Commission on Civic Engagement.\n\nThe 2006-2007 project for IPD is a project with the Trauma Burn Center at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. It focuses on five main areas: Entertainment, School Re-Entry, Communication, Hospital Resource Center and Education/Prevention. There are also plans to integrate the website with the [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]].\n\n==Music department ==\nThe West Bloomfield High School Marching Band placed 4th at the [[Michigan Competing Band Association|MCBA]] state championship in Flight I in 2011.

From fall 1968 through spring 1971, the school was temporarily located at the site of the current Orchard Lake Middle School.  The current building was built in 1971.  West Bloomfield High School has begun to offer the Advanced Placement International Diploma to the classes of 2011 and beyond.  In addition, it established additional Advanced Placement courses starting the 2010-2011 school year.\n\nThe school has been recognized by [[Newsweek]] magazine as being in the top 6% of U.S. public high schools.<ref name=\"official\">[http://web.westbloomfield.k12.mi.us/wbhs/index.html West Bloomfield High School official web site], retrieved 2008-05-28  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030928180806/http://web.westbloomfield.k12.mi.us/wbhs/index.html |date=September 28, 2003 }}</ref>\n\n==Building==\nIn 1986, the district responded to growing enrollment by building a new high school. The large, single-story building was designed in a U-shape around a courtyard that faced Orchard Lake Road. In the late 1990s, the courtyard was enclosed by a 2-story addition that gave the school its curved front facade. In 2000, the media center was completely rebuilt with an emphasis on technology.<ref>[http://www.peterli.com/spm/resources/articles/archive.php?article_id=502] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904035515/http://www.peterli.com/spm/resources/articles/archive.php?article_id=502 |date=September 4, 2009 }}</ref> Small additions have been built throughout the 2000s. \n\nBetween 1955 and 1966, WBHS was housed in the building that is now Abbott Middle School.\nBetween fall 1967 and spring 1971, WBHS occupied the building that now houses Orchard Lake Middle School.\n\n==Instructional Project Design program==\nThe school is known for its Instructional Project Design course, based on the philosophy that students must be allowed a say in designing tools that they will use. The tools in question are internet forums and services created for a variety of educational and civic clients. The program is run by the [[University of Michigan]]'s Flint, MI campus.\n\nThe program was responsible for the creation of \"Warren Easton in Exile,\" a noted website designed to virtually \"rebuild\" a high school in [[New Orleans]] that was shut down after being damaged by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005. Former projects also include the Michigan Student Caucus (formerly the Michigan Youth Caucus), a partnership with the Michigan State House Special Commission on Civic Engagement.\n\nThe 2006-2007 project for IPD is a project with the Trauma Burn Center at the University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor. It focuses on five main areas: Entertainment, School Re-Entry, Communication, Hospital Resource Center and Education/Prevention. There are also plans to integrate the website with the [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]].\n\n==Music department ==\nThe West Bloomfield High School Marching Band placed 4th at the [[Michigan Competing Band Association|MCBA]] state championship in Flight I in 2011.

It lies in the most western part of the [[Grachtengordel (Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]] neighborhood ([[Amsterdam-Centrum|Centrum]] borough), next to the [[Jordaan]], between the Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Westerkerk was built between 1620 and 1631 in Renaissance style according to designs by architect Hendrick de Keyser (1565-1621). He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\">{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|url=|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> (a patriarchal cross).\n\nSeveral older churches in Amsterdam, such as [[Oude Kerk (Amsterdam)|Oude Kerk]] and [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]], were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purposely built Protestant churches. The [[Noorderkerk]] and [[Zuiderkerk]] preceded the Westerkerk. Today the Westerkerk remains the largest church in the Netherlands that was built for Protestants, and is still in use by the PKN (Protestantse Kerk in Nederland)\n\n==Main Duyschot organ==\n[[File:Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Duyschot Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThere was no organ when the Westerkerk was consecrated on Whit Sunday the 8th of June in 1631. According to [[Calvinism]], playing instrumental music inside the church was still considered 'profane' in those days. It took many years of consultation until an organ was finally allowed. At first there was still talk of moving the small organ (koororgel) used in the Nieuwe- or the 'Oudekerk' but the pipes of this 'Oudekerk' choir organ were finally moved to the 'Zuiderkerk'. In 1681 the Westerkerk decided on commissioning organ builder Roelof Barentszn Duyschot for the construction of a new organ. Before it was finished he died and in 1686 the new organ was finished by his son Johannes Duyschot. Later in 1727 it was enlarged with an extra third keyboard by Christiaan Vater who learned his profession at [[Arp Schnitger]].\n\nMany alterations were done on the organ in the course of time. In the 19th century in 1895 even a rebuild of the inside of the organ took place by Daniel Gerard Steenkuyl. Lucky enough many of the old pipes and the wind chests were re used. In 1939, the keyboard was equipped with electric tracker action and even a swell work was added. It was not what this organ was intended to be in sound and action. The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. During the restoration of the inside of the church the organ was brought to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning. In spring 2020 it was replaced in the church and on 18 April the new organist Evan Bogerd did the commissioning concert on internet (youtube at 8pm Amsterdam) For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants are necessary for triggering these stops.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948LjA9ymCg See in this piece 'F\u00e8te Dieu' by Hendrik Andriessen how the stops work. Organ played by Iddo van der Giessen and his father and Evan Bogerd on the stops]</ref>\n\nIn the summer season from April till the end of October there is a weekly free lunchtime concert on Friday at 1pm. In August there is a free concert almost every day for a week 'Geen dag zonder Bach' ('Not a day without Bach') and the 'Grachten' (Canal) festival.  A noncommittal money collection is held after the concert at the exit. The money is used for the costs of the maintenance of the concerts and the organs. Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restauration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk.

The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort.

The organ was almost doubled in size, but was also too big for its case.\n\nSo between 1989 and 1992 the organ was reconstructed by [[Flentrop]] organ builders in [[Zaandam]] to its former mechanical action again more or less like Christiaan Vater made it in 1727. Today the 'bovenwerk' (Oberwerk, located in the top of the organ case) is still almost complete with stops by Vater. An exception is the 'baarpyp', which is made by Steenkuyl in 1896 and the 'Dulciaan' which is made by Flentrop in 1992. The front pipes were made in 1842 by Hermanus Knipscheer. In the situation after 1992, less than half of the pipes are historic and re-used in the 'hoofdwerk' (Great organ) and the 'Rugwerk' (Chaire organ). The keyboards and stop triggers beside it of this just mechanical baroque organ are located in the main case behind this 'rugwerk'. For this kind of baroque organs, it is characteristic that many of the stops, mainly the principals, are doubled in the trebles. This was set up to create more power in leading the congregation in their psalm singing. During the restoration of the inside of the church the organ was brought to Zaandam at Flentrop Orgelbouw for cleaning. In spring 2020 it was replaced in the church and on the 18th of April the new organist Evan Bogerd did the commissioning concert on internet (youtube at 8pm Amsterdam) For complex organ works one or even two stop assistants  are necessary for triggering these stops.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=948LjA9ymCg See in this piece 'F\u00e8te Dieu' by Hendrik Andriessen how the stops work. Organ played by Iddo van der Giessen and his father and Evan Bogerd on the stops]</ref>\n\nIn the summer season from April till the end of October there is a weekly free lunchtime concert on Friday at 1pm. In August there is a free concert almost every day for a week 'Geen dag zonder Bach' ('Not a day without Bach') and the 'Grachten' (Canal) festival.  A noncommittal money collection is held after the concert at the exit. The money is used for the costs of the maintenance of the concerts and the organs. Music by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685-1750) is performed almost weekly in the divine Sunday services. Bach was born in 1685, that is a year before the organ was finished but as far as we know, he never visited Amsterdam. His music sounds like it was made for this baroque instrument. See the site of Westerkerk for the Lunchtime concert schedule.\n\nOrganist in the Westerkerk is Evan Bogerd.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hH4oVxGWSd4 Jos van der Kooy former organist performing Bach on the Duyschot organ]</ref>\n\n== Stoplist of the Duyschot Organ ==\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''I Rugwerk''' (Chaire organ) CDE\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holpijp 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Open Fluit 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sifflet 1\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Sexquialter II-III ranks\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp III-VIII ranks\n|-\n|Scherp IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''II Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 16' Td\n|-\n|Prestant 8' Td\n|-\n|Quintadeen  8'\n|-\n|Octaaf 4' Td\n|-\n|Nasard 3' Td\n|-\n|Superoctaaf 2' Td\n|-\n|Mixtuur III-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Scherp IV-VII ranks bass/treble\n|-\n|Sexquialter  III-IV ranks treble\n|-\n|Fagot 16'\n|-\n|Trompet 8'\n|-\n|\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''III Bovenwerk''' (Oberwerk organ) C\u2013d<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Baarpijp 8\u2032 \n|-\n|Quintadeen 8\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Holfluit 4\u2032\n|-\n|Quint 3\u2032 Td\n|-\n|Woudfluit 2' Td\n|-\n|Tertiaan II-III ranks\n|-\n|Ruispijp III-VI ranks\n|-\n|Dulciaan 8\u2032\n|-\n|Vox Humana 8\u2032\n|-\n|\n|-\n|''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Pedals''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n|Bourdon 16\u2032\n|-\n|Prestant 8\u2032\n|-\n|Roerquint 6\u2032\n|-\n|Octaaf 4\u2032\n|-\n|Bazuin 16\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 8\u2032\n|-\n|Trompet 4\u2032\n|}\n|}\n\nCouplers and shutters:\n* Shutters for all manuals and pedals.\n* Couplers: I/II, II/I, III/II, I/P, II/P, III/P \n* Td = Treble is doubled\n\n== The paintings of the organ ==\n[[File:Interieur, orgel, detail - binnenzijde van het linker hoofdwerkluik, 'De Koningin van Scheba bezoekt Koning Salamo'.

On the left panel we see the dancing and playing King David in front of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. On the right panel we see the [[Queen of Sheba]] presenting gifts to King [[Solomon]]. Both stories in the book of Kings in the old testament of the Bible. Gerard de Lairesse was born in Li\u00e8ge in French Belgium in 1640 and he moved to Amsterdam in 1664. In the second half of the 17th Century, he was one of the most popular painters in the Netherlands. At this moment, the shutters of the Duyschot organ can be seen on a retrospective of the work of Gerard de Lairesse at the National Museum Twente in Enschede. The outside paintings of these panels or shutters were lost in the 19th century when the church wanted to sell them. The [[grisaille]]s on the 'rugwerk' panels were also painted by Gerard de Lairesse; The [[four evangelists]] with their items are showen. The inside of the 'rugwerk' shutters have paintings of old musical instruments. The complete organ was cleaned and re-painted in 1992 in its original state of colour in 1686; most of it in marble imitation.\n\n== Ds. A.H. Visser organ ==\n[[File:Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Choir Organ Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\nThe small organ on the east side of the church was built in 1963 by D.A. Flentrop from Zaandam. It was tuned and slightly altered  in 2001. In that year it was named after the minister Ds. H.A Visser who was the man begging for money to buy the organ in 1963. He succeeded. The organ has 12 stops over 2 manuals and pedal. Since 1963 the organ case was in not painted but plain oak wood. After the renovation it was painted in a light green color. In 2017 the organ was cleaned by Flentrop Zaandam. During the church interior restauration it was packed against the dust.\n\nStoplist\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"24\" cellpadding=\"16\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse;\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''I Hoofdwerk''' (Great organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Prestant 4'\n|-\n| Gemshoorn 4'\n|-\n| Octaaf 2'\n|-\n| Sesquialter II ranks\n|-\n| Mixtuur III-IV ranks\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''II Borstwerk''' (Swell organ) C\u2013g<sup>3</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Holpijp 8'\n|-\n| Roerfluit 4'\t\n|-\n| Nachthoorn 2'\t\n|-\n| Cimbel I-II ranks\t\n|-\n| Regaal 8'\n|-\n| ''Tremulant''\n|}\n| style=\"vertical-align:top\" |\n{| border=\"0\"\n| colspan=4 | '''Pedal''' C\u2013d<sup>1</sup>\n----\n|-\n| Subbas 16'\t\n|}\n|}\n* Couplers: II/I, I/P, II/P\n\n== The tower with the spire ==\n[[File:Part from Westertoren, gravure in Architectura Moderna - Amsterdam - 20013240 - RCE.jpg|left|75px|thumb|Not realized part from Westertoren, designed by Hendrick de Keyser]]\n[[File:WestertorenAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|150px|Westertoren]]\nThe tower, called the Westertoren (\"Western tower\"), is the highest church tower in Amsterdam, at 87 meters (\u00b1286 feet). It is not known who the designer of the spire was. Hendrick de Keyser designed an octagonal spire for the tower which was never built. It is suggested [[Jacob van Campen]] was the designer. The crown topping the spire is the [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughguides.com/travel/europe/netherlands/amsterdam/the-grachtengordel/the-westerkerk.aspx|title=The Westerkerk|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Bells in the 'Westertoren' ==\nJust above the clock-faces is the carillon. The largest 14 of the 51 bells in this carillon were cast by [[Pieter and Fran\u00e7ois Hemony|Fran\u00e7ois Hemony]] in 1658. The modern bells were cast in 1959 by [[Eijsbouts]] replacing bells which had been damaged by atmospheric pollution. In 1991 three bells more were added by the same foundery. The smaller Hemony bells, which are not currently In use, can be seen in the tower together with the original baton keyboard from the 17th century. The carillon was enlarged to 4 octaves and is tuned in [[Meantone temperament]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qImw1T4X0xk Boudewijn Zwart performs: Sonata in d (2 parts) by [[Baldassare Galuppi]] - Choral 'Ich ruff zu Dir' by Johann Sebastian [[Bach]] - Entry of the Gladiators by [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (composer)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]] and Wien bleibt Wien by [[Johann Schrammel]].]</ref> It is the only carillon in the city chiming the entire twenty-four hours. (At the request of the residents of the 'Jordaan' District.) The drum to do this, was made by Jurriaen Spraeckel from [[Zutphen]] in 1659 and it still chimes every quarter of the hour to announce the hour and half hour strike. On the quarter of the hour a short tune is performed. The two strike bells were made by Assuerus (Ahasverus) Koster in 1636. The hour strike bell (F<sup>0</sup>) is the largest in Amsterdam (7509&nbsp;kg) and is hung in the room for the carillon. The text on this [[Bourdon (bell)|Bourdon]] bell is: 'VERBUM DOMINI MANET IN ETERNUM - ASSUERUS KOSTER ME FECIT AMSTELDAMI 1636' The smaller bell (A<sup>1</sup>) for half hour is hung in top of the spire just under the crown. Weekly on Tuesday at noon the city [[carillon]]eur gives his recital on the carillon for an hour. He is also responsible for the tunes on the drum and changes these twice a year. At this moment (2015) Boudewijn Zwart is the City Carilloneur.\n\n[[File:Westerkerk van Amsterdam, luiden van klokken - SoundCloud - Beeld en Geluid.ogg|thumb|Westerkerk Amsterdam, ringing the bells for a service]]\nIn a lower chamber behind the sounding boards in the tower wall there are three swinging bells also made by Fran\u00e7ois Hemony in 1658. The largest swinging bell was replaced after 27 years by Claude Fremy (his pupil, nephew and successor), because it was cracked. The bells (a major triad) are rung to announce the divine service on Sunday and also when the service is on, during praying the 'Our Father'. This bell by Fremy is also connected with the pedals in the baton keyboard of the carillon. The latest renovation works on the carillon were in 2006 when the tower was also renovated. In that year the crown on top was also painted in its original blue color.\n\n== Rembrandt ==\n[[File:Westerkerk - Kirche innen 6 Rembrandt-Epitaph.jpg|thumb|100px|Remembrance stone copied from ''[[The Night Watch]]''.]]\n[[Rembrandt van Rijn]] was buried somewhere under a tombstone in the Westerkerk<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> on October 8, 1669. The exact location of the grave is unknown; the number of his grave was lost. It was in a numbered 'kerkgraf' (grave owned by the church). There is a memorial marker on the north wall, made in 1909 after a model on the 'Nachtwacht'. After twenty years, his remains were taken away and destroyed. That was customary with the remains of poor people at that time. Rembrandt was buried as a poor man.<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/>  Every year on his birthday anniversary, the 15th of July, he is remembered in the Westerkerk with a lunchtime concert with music from the time of Rembrandt's life, and flowers are hung on his memorial marker.\n\nRembrandt's lover [[Hendrickje Stoffels]] was also buried here, as was Rembrandt's son [[Titus van Rijn]].<ref name=\"Dunford2010\"/> Other painters buried in the Westerkerk are [[Nicolaes Berchem]], [[Gillis d'Hondecoeter]],  [[Melchior d'Hondecoeter]] and [[Govert Flinck]].\n\n== Dutch Royal Family ==\n[[File:Beatrix1966Claus.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Princess Beatrix and Claus van Amsberg]]\nOn March 10, 1966, Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] married Prince [[Claus von Amsberg]] in the Westerkerk. The 'Nieuwe Kerk' on Dam square where Royals normally have the weddings, was in renovation at that time.\n\n== Anne Frank ==\nThe Westerkerk is located close to the [[Anne Frank House]] where diarist [[Anne Frank]], her family and others were hid in the 'Achterhuis' from [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecution for two years during [[World War II]]. The Westertoren is mentioned frequently in her diary \u2013 its clock-face on the tower could be seen from the attic of the Achterhuis, and Anne Frank described the chiming of the carillon as a source of comfort. A memorial statue of Anne Frank is located outside the church at Westermarkt.\n\n== Burials ==\n[[File:Amsterdam Westerkerk Innen Langhaus Ost 1.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Westerkerk]]\n* [[Nicolaes Pietersz.

David Lowe Macintyre, Arg. & Suth'd Highrs.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery in attack when, acting as Adjutant of his battalion, he was constantly in evidence in the firing line, and by his coolness under most heavy shell and machine-gun fire inspired the confidence of all ranks.\n\nThree days later he was in command of the firing line during an attack, and showed throughout most courageous and skilful leading in face of heavy machine-gun fire. When barbed wire was encountered, he personally reconnoitred it before leading his men forward. On one occasion, when extra strong entanglements were reached, he organised and took forward a party of men.\nand under heavy machine-gun fire supervisedthe making of gaps.\n\nLater, when the greater part of our line was definitely held up, Lt. Macintyre rallied a small party, pushed forward through the enemy barrage in pursuit of an enemy machine-gun detachment, and ran them to earth in a \"pill-box\" a short distance ahead, killing three and capturing an officer, ten other ranks and five machine guns. In this redoubt he and his party raided three \"pill-boxes\" and disposed of the occupants, thus enabling the battalion to capture the redoubt.\n\nWhen the battalion was ordered to take up a defensive position, Lt. Macintyre, after he had been relieved of command of the firing line, reconnoitred the right flank which was exposed. When doing this an enemy machine gun opened fire close to him. Without any hesitation he rushed it singlehanded, put the team to flight and brought in the gun. On returning to the redoubt he continued to show splendid spirit while supervising consolidation.\n\nThe success of the advance was largely due to Lt. Macintyre's fine leadership and initiative, and his gallantry and leading was an inspiring example to all.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30975 |supp=y|page=12669|date=25 October 1918}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter the war, he entered the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]] in the [[Office of Works]] and by the time of his appointment as a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[1949 New Year Honours]], he was Under Secretary for Scotland in its successor, the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=38493 |supp=y|page=4|date=31 December 1948}}</ref>  He still held the post at his retirement in 1959.\n\nThe medal is now on display in the [[National War Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh Castle]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Monuments to Courage]] (David Harvey, 1999)\n*[[The Register of the Victoria Cross]] (This England, 1997)\n*[[Scotland's Forgotten Valour]] (Graham Ross, 1995)\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20041225165403/http://www.homeusers.prestel.co.uk/stewart/edinburg.htm Location of grave and VC medal] ''(Edinburgh)''\n*[http://www.hwy56.com/warlinks/memories/barker/ash.htm History of Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n{{Royal Regiments of Scotland}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Macintyre, David Lowe}}\n[[Category:1895 births]]\n[[Category:1967 deaths]]\n[[Category:British World War I recipients of the Victoria Cross]]\n[[Category:Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders officers]]\n[[Category:British Army personnel of World War I]]\n[[Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath]]\n[[Category:People from Islay]]\n[[Category:British Army recipients of the Victoria Cross]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:British civil servants]]\n", "name_user": "Archon 2488", "label": "safe", "comment": "sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lowe_MacIntyre"}

However, Azula lies to Ozai by claiming that Zuko killed Aang, as she has a hunch that Aang survived and knows that all the blame would now fall on Zuko if this were true. During the two-part episode \"The Day of Black Sun\", Aang assembles an elite invasion force and attacks the capital, taking advantage of an eclipse that rendered the firebenders powerless. Having already gained knowledge of the invasion during the takeover of Ba Sing Se, Azula warns Ozai, who is evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion. Azula and her Dai Li agents stall Aang and his friends [[Sokka]] and [[Toph Beifong|Toph]] from finding Ozai before the eclipse, which lasts only eight minutes, allowing the firebenders to retaliate with full force once they regain their bending, causing the invasion to fail. However, Zuko defects to Team Avatar after confronting Ozai during the eclipse.<ref name=\"The Eclipse\">{{cite episode|title=The Day of Black Sun Part 2: The Eclipse|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=311|airdate=2007-11-26|season=3|number=11|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

However, Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula) and Sokka's father Hakoda manage to escape. Mai betrays Azula by aiding the group's escape, proclaiming that she did so out of her love for Zuko. Enraged, Azula attempts to attack Mai but is stopped by Ty Lee, who renders her incapable of bending by blocking her chi (''the energy within one which one would use for bending'').

Azula, having learned of the letters Ursa sent which falsely claim that Zuko is not Ozai's biological son, dodges her brother's questions while distracting him with her bending long enough to access the letters and burn them.

In the film, she is played by [[Summer Bishil]].\n\n==Conception and creation==\nKonietzko notes that Azula's design when compared to other main characters \"''came together relatively quickly''\". Azula was originally going to wear a heavily phoenix-themed armor, though the idea was eventually abandoned. Azula's blue firebending was meant to symbolize that she was more powerful than Zuko as well as a firebending prodigy and also easily distinguish her attacks from his in their fights.<ref name=artbook /> She was initially intended to have an arranged marriage during the third season.<ref name=\"avatarspirit.net\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=19|title=An Avatar Spring Break with Mike and Bryan (part 2 of 3) |date = 2007-04-06 |publisher = avatarspirit.net}}</ref> Both creators hold the character in high regard; Konietzko believes she is \"by far the most complex, interesting, and dangerous villain in the series\" while DiMartino wrote that she was his favorite antagonist in the series.<ref name=artbook>''Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Art of the Animated Series'', pg. 87.</ref>\n\n===Voice===\nAzula is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].

Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards Firebending gained her much attention and acclaim, often at Zuko's expense. Even when young, Azula suggests that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the [[heir apparent]], her uncle Iroh, whom she dubbed \"''a quitter and a loser''\" for abandoning his siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which would have secured the Fire Nation's victory in the war, after the death of his son Lu Ten.<ref name=\"Zuko Alone\"/>\n\n===Personality===\nAzula is a firebending prodigy and a dedicated perfectionist.<ref name=\"The Avatar State\" /> As one who wants nothing less than absolute control, she likewise has remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.\n \nFrom a young age, Azula had a cruel, sociopathic personality, showing almost no empathy or remorse for actions that harmed others both physically and emotionally. Azula was heavily influenced by her father, who favored her over Zuko due to her superior firebending abilities.<ref name=\"Zuko Alone\" /> However, Azula's father was a ruthless man incapable of true love. Azula was also constantly scolded by her mother due to her cruel nature. This shaped Azula's fears that she could not count on love from anyone, no matter how close they seemed. Unable to trust others, she instead began to control them using fear.\n\nAlthough an amazing strategist and capable of predicting her enemies' moves, she is awkward in [[social ineptitude|social situations]], and later admits to jealousy of Ty Lee's ability to attract potential sweethearts during \"The Beach\" episode. She ends up seducing Chan with Ty Lee's advice to act dumb; however, she scares him away when she shows her true personality.\n\nFrom childhood, Azula believed her mother favored Zuko and thought her monstrous, which she admitted to be true but hurt her deeply. After she was betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, her mental state gradually collapsed, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko. After her defeat, it is revealed in the graphic novel ''The Promise'' that she was admitted into a mental institution in the Fire Nation due to her psychosis, paranoia, and deranged mental state. Both in the series and the comics, she is shown to be disturbed by frequent hallucinations of her mother.\n\nAlthough Azula often acts cold-hearted towards her uncle and her brother, she appears to show some genuine care and love for Zuko in the early episodes of season 3. Although she seems to care about her friends, she frequently manipulates them, as seen when she threatens Ty Lee into leaving the circus in Book 2. There has been only one known occurrence of Azula showing remorse by apologizing after unintentionally insulting Ty Lee.\n\nPsychological analyses estimate Azula as highly intelligent,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/azulapsychology|title=The Psychology of Azula l Avatar: The Last Airbender|last=Hickson|first=Timothy|date=13 April 2019|website=archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shung|first=Min Tham|date=|title=The Psychology of Azula\u2019s Character|url=https://shungmintham.com/s/The-Psychology-of-Azula.pdf|journal=DigiPen Institute of Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> and suffering from [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s.

Her excellent firebending abilities, hand-to-hand combat skills, intelligence, agility and charisma make her a formidable opponent.\n\n====Blue flames====\nIt is unclear why Azula is the only firebender who can produce blue flames, which are hotter and contain more energy (according to [[Planck's law]]) than those of other firebenders who bend normal orange flames. In fact, her name is derived from azul, the Spanish, Galician and Portuguese word for blue. However, Azula could not produce blue fire as a young child, as shown in flashbacks. Similarly, her grandfather Azulon was never shown to wield blue flames despite his namesake implying otherwise. Azula can also use her firebending in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks. She often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand common to other firebenders.<ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring. She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she once used to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Katara, Zuko and Toph.<ref name=\"The Chase\">{{cite episode\n|title=The Chase\n|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=208\n|airdate=2006-05-26\n|season=2\n|number=8\n|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

In \"[[The Avatar State]]\", she bested Zuko in combat without resorting to firebending, and in \"[[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|The Day of Black Sun]]\", avoided the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes without her bending to aid her. In \"[[Appa's Lost Days]]\", when Suki made a [[Stabbing|stab]] attack at Azula with her [[Japanese war fan|fan]], Azula jumped horizontally and knocked Suki's sword out of her hand and onto a tree.<ref name=\"The Eclipse\"/>\n\nAzula is an expert in persuasion. She is capable of using [[psychological warfare]], intimidation, and mistruths to con other people into obeying her. She also has the ability to lie easily without causing any change in her breathing and heartrate (an indication of her psychopathy), making it nearly impossible to detect if she's lying, which she demonstrated in \"[[The Day of Black Sun]]\". She is also an accomplished strategist, as she was able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable, while usurping the Earth King and hierarchy of the [[Earth Kingdom]] capital all in one swift move.<ref name=\"The Crossroads of Destiny\" /><ref name=\"The Awakening\">{{cite episode|title=The Awakening|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=301|airdate=2007-09-21|season=3|number=1|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

However, Azula lies to Ozai by claiming that Zuko killed Aang, as she has a hunch that Aang survived and knows that all the blame would now fall on Zuko if this were true. During the two-part episode \"The Day of Black Sun\", Aang assembles an elite invasion force and attacks the capital, taking advantage of an eclipse that rendered the firebenders powerless. Having already gained knowledge of the invasion during the takeover of Ba Sing Se, Azula warns Ozai, who is evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion. Azula and her Dai Li agents stall Aang and his friends [[Sokka]] and [[Toph Beifong|Toph]] from finding Ozai before the eclipse, which lasts only eight minutes, allowing the firebenders to retaliate with full force once they regain their bending, causing the invasion to fail.

However, Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula) and Sokka's father Hakoda manage to escape. Mai betrays Azula by aiding the group's escape, proclaiming that she did so out of her love for Zuko.

Azula was originally going to wear a heavily phoenix-themed armor, though the idea was eventually abandoned. Azula's blue firebending was meant to symbolize that she was more powerful than Zuko as well as a firebending prodigy and also easily distinguish her attacks from his in their fights.<ref name=artbook /> She was initially intended to have an arranged marriage during the third season.<ref name=\"avatarspirit.net\">{{Cite web |url = http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/interviews.php?id=19|title=An Avatar Spring Break with Mike and Bryan (part 2 of 3) |date = 2007-04-06 |publisher = avatarspirit.net}}</ref> Both creators hold the character in high regard; Konietzko believes she is \"by far the most complex, interesting, and dangerous villain in the series\" while DiMartino wrote that she was his favorite antagonist in the series.<ref name=artbook>''Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Art of the Animated Series'', pg. 87.</ref>\n\n===Voice===\nAzula is voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]].

Her sharp wit and the skill she displayed towards Firebending gained her much attention and acclaim, often at Zuko's expense. Even when young, Azula suggests that her father would make a better Fire Lord than the [[heir apparent]], her uncle Iroh, whom she dubbed \"''a quitter and a loser''\" for abandoning his siege of the Earth Kingdom's capital Ba Sing Se, which would have secured the Fire Nation's victory in the war, after the death of his son Lu Ten.<ref name=\"Zuko Alone\"/>\n\n===Personality===\nAzula is a firebending prodigy and a dedicated perfectionist.<ref name=\"The Avatar State\" /> As one who wants nothing less than absolute control, she likewise has remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.\n \nFrom a young age, Azula had a cruel, sociopathic personality, showing almost no empathy or remorse for actions that harmed others both physically and emotionally. Azula was heavily influenced by her father, who favored her over Zuko due to her superior firebending abilities.<ref name=\"Zuko Alone\" /> However, Azula's father was a ruthless man incapable of true love. Azula was also constantly scolded by her mother due to her cruel nature. This shaped Azula's fears that she could not count on love from anyone, no matter how close they seemed. Unable to trust others, she instead began to control them using fear.\n\nAlthough an amazing strategist and capable of predicting her enemies' moves, she is awkward in [[social ineptitude|social situations]], and later admits to jealousy of Ty Lee's ability to attract potential sweethearts during \"The Beach\" episode. She ends up seducing Chan with Ty Lee's advice to act dumb; however, she scares him away when she shows her true personality.\n\nFrom childhood, Azula believed her mother favored Zuko and thought her monstrous, which she admitted to be true but hurt her deeply. After she was betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, her mental state gradually collapsed, as her attacks became far more vicious and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko. After her defeat, it is revealed in the graphic novel ''The Promise'' that she was admitted into a mental institution in the Fire Nation due to her psychosis, paranoia, and deranged mental state. Both in the series and the comics, she is shown to be disturbed by frequent hallucinations of her mother.\n\nAlthough Azula often acts cold-hearted towards her uncle and her brother, she appears to show some genuine care and love for Zuko in the early episodes of season 3. Although she seems to care about her friends, she frequently manipulates them, as seen when she threatens Ty Lee into leaving the circus in Book 2. There has been only one known occurrence of Azula showing remorse by apologizing after unintentionally insulting Ty Lee.\n\nPsychological analyses estimate Azula as highly intelligent,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/azulapsychology|title=The Psychology of Azula l Avatar: The Last Airbender|last=Hickson|first=Timothy|date=13 April 2019|website=archive.org|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shung|first=Min Tham|date=|title=The Psychology of Azula\u2019s Character|url=https://shungmintham.com/s/The-Psychology-of-Azula.pdf|journal=DigiPen Institute of Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> and suffering from [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] and [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s.

Her excellent firebending abilities, hand-to-hand combat skills, intelligence, agility and charisma make her a formidable opponent.\n\n====Blue flames====\nIt is unclear why Azula is the only firebender who can produce blue flames, which are hotter and contain more energy (according to [[Planck's law]]) than those of other firebenders who bend normal orange flames. In fact, her name is derived from azul, the Spanish, Galician and Portuguese word for blue. However, Azula could not produce blue fire as a young child, as shown in flashbacks. Similarly, her grandfather Azulon was never shown to wield blue flames despite his namesake implying otherwise. Azula can also use her firebending in previously unseen ways, such as jets of flames and whirling disks. She often firebends using only two fingers, rather than a closed fist or open hand common to other firebenders.<ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> Azula can fight for long periods of time without tiring. She is also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames, which she once used to withstand the simultaneous combined attacks of Aang, Katara, Zuko and Toph.<ref name=\"The Chase\">{{cite episode\n|title=The Chase\n|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=208\n|airdate=2006-05-26\n|season=2\n|number=8\n|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

It is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is. Some call lightning the cold-blooded fire. It is precise and deadly like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.\"|General Iroh (''Avatar: The Last Airbender'')|source=}}\nAzula is capable of lightning generation, one of the rarest types of firebending; Iroh notes that it isn't really possible to teach lightning generation, it's just something particularly powerful firebenders are capable of.<ref name=\"The Avatar State\">{{cite episode\n|title=The Avatar State\n|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=201\n|airdate=2006-03-17\n|season=2\n|number=1\n|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.

In \"[[The Avatar State]]\", she bested Zuko in combat without resorting to firebending, and in \"[[Avatar: The Last Airbender (season 3)|The Day of Black Sun]]\", avoided the combined forces of Aang, Toph, and Sokka for several minutes without her bending to aid her. In \"[[Appa's Lost Days]]\", when Suki made a [[Stabbing|stab]] attack at Azula with her [[Japanese war fan|fan]], Azula jumped horizontally and knocked Suki's sword out of her hand and onto a tree.<ref name=\"The Eclipse\"/>\n\nAzula is an expert in persuasion. She is capable of using [[psychological warfare]], intimidation, and mistruths to con other people into obeying her. She also has the ability to lie easily without causing any change in her breathing and heartrate (an indication of her psychopathy), making it nearly impossible to detect if she's lying, which she demonstrated in \"[[The Day of Black Sun]]\". She is also an accomplished strategist, as she was able to conquer Ba Sing Se, a city thought to be impenetrable, while usurping the Earth King and hierarchy of the [[Earth Kingdom]] capital all in one swift move.<ref name=\"The Crossroads of Destiny\" /><ref name=\"The Awakening\">{{cite episode|title=The Awakening|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=301|airdate=2007-09-21|season=3|number=1|transcript=Avatar: The Last Airbender.
