It was Beatty's and Keaton's first film together since 1981's ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]],'' and Beatty's third film with Hawn, after 1971's ''[[$ (film)|$]]'' and 1975's ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]''.\n\nThe film is one of the [[List of biggest box office bombs|biggest box office flops]] in American film history, grossing a little over $10 million worldwide from a $90 million budget.<ref>[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/records/budgets.php Movie Budget Records] from TheNumbers.com</ref> The film was Beatty's last appearance on screen for 15 years before he starred in ''[[Rules Don't Apply (film)|Rules Don't Apply]]'' in November 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nPorter Stoddard ([[Warren Beatty]]) is so prosperous an architect, he has New York homes on [[Park Avenue]] and in [[the Hamptons]], as well as a vacation lodge out west in [[Sun Valley, Idaho]]. He has been married for 25 years to the equally successful Ellie ([[Diane Keaton]]), an interior designer, but has been having an affair with Alex ([[Nastassja Kinski]]), a beautiful young cellist.\n\nThere is trouble brewing in the marriage of their best friends. Mona Morris ([[Goldie Hawn]]) wants a divorce from antique-dealer husband Griffin ([[Garry Shandling]]), after catching him having a hotel tryst. The part she did not catch is that Griffin's new romantic partner is a cross-dressing man. Mona wants to travel to Mississippi to see her girlhood antebellum home. Ellie is worried about Mona's depression over the state of her marriage and does not feel she should be alone, so Porter is asked to accompany Mona down south. There, they end up having a quick sexual fling.\n\nWith things awkward at home for both, Porter and Griffin fly by themselves to Sun Valley to get away from their troubles. But it is not long before Porter finds himself in a romantic entanglement with Eugenie Claybourne ([[Andie MacDowell]]), a spoiled heiress whose gun-loving father ([[Charlton Heston]]) is already loading his shotgun in case Porter does wrong by his daughter. A free spirit named Auburn ([[Jenna Elfman]]) also ends up coaxing Porter and Griffin to a Halloween party, where they end up dressed in preposterous costumes.\n\nBy the time Porter returns to New York, everything is falling apart, not only his home life but his house. And, once and for all, Griffin finds the nerve to tell his wife that he is leaving her for someone else, but it is not another woman.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Warren Beatty]] as Porter Stoddard\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Ellie Stoddard\n* [[Goldie Hawn]] as Mona Morris\n* [[Garry Shandling]] as Griffin Morris\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Eugenie Claybourne\n* [[Jenna Elfman]] as Auburn\n* [[Nastassja Kinski]] as Alex\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as Mr. Claybourne\n* [[Marian Seldes]] as Mrs. Claybourne\n* [[Josh Hartnett]] as Tom Stoddard\n* Katharine Towne as Holly\n* [[Ian McNeice]] as Peter Principal\n* [[William Hootkins|Bill Hootkins]] as Barney\n* [[Terri Hoyos]] as Yolanda\n* [[Tricia Vessey]] as Alice\n* [[Azura Skye]] as Spider\n* [[Buck Henry]] as Suttler\n* [[Charlie Rose]] (archived footage) as himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe production costs of the film totaled an estimated US$90 million,<ref name=\"imdb_bus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141907/business|title=Town & Country (2001) - Box office / business|accessdate=September 29, 2017|website=IMDb.com}}</ref> not including distribution and marketing expenses. The total worldwide box office came to $10,365,000.<ref name=\"imdb_bus\" /> Considering that typically half of the gross box office receipts go to the exhibitors and half to the filmmakers, ''Town & Country'' lost the studio at least $100 million, and probably much more if costs for distribution and marketing are considered, which average around $35\u201350 million for a studio picture such as this. The studio, having already spent in excess of $90 million, backed a limited distribution and marketing campaign in the $15\u201320 million range, bringing the total cost to $105\u2013110 million. However, some insiders have said that the total production costs were more likely in the $100\u2013105 million range, with the prints and ads at around $20 million, which would bring the total costs to $125 million.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n===1998\u20131999===\nThe production itself began on June 8, 1998, on a budget of $44 million, including $10 million up front for Beatty. Filming was originally supposed to wrap by the fall of 1998 for a summer or fall 1999 release. Various problems occurred during filming, however, including Beatty's meticulous demand for many takes. Also, the script was still being developed, as writers were not satisfied with the ending originally written by [[Michael Laughlin]]. Various other screenwriters were brought in, including [[Paul Attanasio]] and [[Gary Ross]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Attanasio Bio |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001921/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm |publisher=iMDB}}</ref> By April 1999, production was still going, but Shandling had to leave to do another film (''[[What Planet Are You From?]]''), as did Keaton (''[[Hanging Up]]'', which she also directed). It took a full year before they could gather the cast back together to film the new pages written by [[Buck Henry]]. Henry was hired for what was originally only going to be a few weeks of polish work. Eventually, he stayed on for several months and ended up earning (by some accounts) $3 million for rewriting roughly half of the script.  Henry has stated that he bought a new home with the money he made on this \"quick rewrite assignment.\"\n\n===2000 reshoots===\nReshoots were scheduled to begin on April 10, 2000, and were expected to last just a couple of weeks. However, filming continued through June 2000, when it finally wrapped two years after principal photography originally began. The reshoots included all of the new scenes, with screenwriter Buck Henry joining the cast as a divorce mediator. A new climax at a fashion gala involving all of the main female characters was written and filmed. Also, the closure scenes with Shandling and Hawn at the antique store and the scene with Beatty and Kinski on the street near the end were added. The scene between Beatty and Kinski in Manhattan as she is hailing a cab was actually filmed in downtown Los Angeles and was one of the last scenes filmed.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film finally made it into theaters on April 27, 2001, nearly three years after filming began, and received negative reviews from critics.

Following the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], the decisive point in the [[ethnogenesis]] of the South Slavic ethnic group was the creation of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after World War II, a state in the framework of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. This was followed by the development of a separate Macedonian language and national literature, and the foundation of a distinct [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and national historiography.\n\n===Ancient and Roman period===\nIn antiquity, much of central-northern Macedonia (the [[Vardar river|Vardar basin]]) was inhabited by [[Paionians]] who expanded from the lower Strymon basin. The Pelagonian plain was inhabited by the [[Pelagones]], an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] tribe of [[Upper Macedonia]]; whilst the western region (Ohrid-Prespa) was said to have been inhabited by [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] [[tribe]]s.<ref>A J Toynbee.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)... Like Kosovo, Macedonia was slated for Serb settlements and internal colonization. The authorities projected the settlement of 50,000 families in Macedonia, though only 4,200 families had been placed in 280 colonies by 1940.\" For more see: Ivo Banac,  \"The National Question in Yugoslavia.

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

The anti-Bulgariansim (or Bulgarophobia) increased almost to the level of state ideology during the ideological monopoly of the League of Communists of Macedonia, and still continues to do so today, although with less ferocity... However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations. Macedonia could confirm itself as a state with its own past, present and future only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. For more see: Mirjana Maleska.

It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw.

The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume.

The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

The suffering during the wars, the endless struggle of the Balkan monarchies for dominance over the population increased the Macedonians' sentiment that the institutionalization of an independent Macedonian nation would put an end to their suffering.

In the 1920 Yugoslav parliamentary elections, 25% of the total Communist vote came from Macedonia, but participation was low (only 55%),  mainly because the pro-Bulgarian IMRO organised a boycott against the elections. In the following years, the communists attempted to enlist the pro-IMRO sympathies of the population in their cause. In the context of this attempt, in 1924 the Comintern organized the filed signing of the so-called [[May Manifesto]], in which independence of partitioned Macedonia was required.<ref>Victor Roudometof, ''Nationalism, Globalization, and Orthodoxy: The Social Origins of Ethnic Conflict in the Balkans (Contributions to the Study of World History)'', Praeger, 2001, p.187</ref> In 1925 with the help of the Comintern, the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (United)]] was created, composed of former left-wing [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) members.

The Balkan communist parties supported the national consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian people and created Macedonian sections within the parties, headed by prominent IMRO (United) members. The sense of belonging to a separate Macedonian nation gained credence during World War II when ethnic Macedonian communist partisan detachments were formed. In 1943 the Communist Party of Macedonia was established and the resistance movement grew up.

However if the Yugoslavs would recognize the Slavic inhabitants of Vardar Macedonia as Bulgarians, it would  mean that the area should be part of Bulgaria. Practically in [[post-World War II]] Macedonia, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's state policy of forced [[Serbianisation]] was changed with a new one \u2014 of [[Macedonization]]. The codification of the Macedonian language and the recognition of the Macedonian nation had the main goal: finally to ban any [[Bulgarophilia]] among the Macedonians and to build a new consciousness, based on identification with Yugoslavia. As result Yugoslavia introduced again an abrupt ''de-Bulgarization'' of the people in the [[PR Macedonia]], such as it already had conducted in the [[Vardar Banovina]] during the [[Interwar period]]. Around 100,000 pro-Bulgarian elements were imprisoned for violations of the special ''Law for the protection of Macedonian national honor'', and over 1,200 were allegedly killed. In this way generations of students grew up educated in strong anti-Bulgarian sentiment which  during the times of [[Communist Yugoslavia]], increased to the level of [[state policy]]. Its main agenda was a result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarians and the new Macedonian nation, because Macedonians could confirm themselves as a separate community with its own history, only through differentiating itself from Bulgaria. This policy has continued in the new Republic of Macedonia after 1990, although with less intensity. Thus, the Bulgarian part of the identity of the Slavic-speaking population in Vardar Macedonia has died out.{{efn|See:<ref>\"Within Greece, and also within the new kingdom of Yugoslavia, which Serbia had joined in 1918, the ejection of the Bulgarian church, the closure of Bulgarian schools, and the banning of publication in Bulgarian, together with the expulsion or flight to Bulgaria of a large proportion of the Macedonian Slav intelligentsia, served as the prelude to campaigns of forcible cultural and linguistic assimilation...In both countries, these policies of de-bulgarization and assimilation were pursued, with fluctuating degrees of vigor, right through to 1941, when the Second World War engulfed the Balkan peninsula. The degree of these policies' success, however, remains open to question. The available evidence suggests that Bulgarian national sentiment among the Macedonian Slavs of Yugoslavia and Greece remained strong throughout the interwar period, though they lacked the means to offer more than passive resistance to official policies.\" For more see: F.

Once again, the Exarchist clergy and Bulgarian teachers were expelled, all Bulgarian-language signs and books removed, and all Bulgarian clubs, societies, and organizations dissolved, The Serbianization of family surnames proceeded as before the war, with Stankov becoming Stankovic and Atanasov entered in the books by Atanackovic... Thousands of Macedonians left for Bulgaria. Though there were fewer killings of \"Bulgarians\" (a pro-Bulgarian source claimed 342 such instances and 47 additional disappearances in 1918 \u2013 1924), the conventional forms of repression (jailings, internments etc.) were applied more systematically and with greater effect than before (the same source lists 2,900 political arrests in the same period)...

Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs, and to create an national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.

However, it is more important to say openly that a great deal of these anti-Bulgarian sentiments result from the need to distinguish between the Bulgarian and the Macedonian nations.

They have a special reserved seat in the nations parliament. In 2002, they numbered 731.

(See also ''[[Macedonians in Slovenia]]''.)\n\nOther significant ethnic Macedonian communities can also be found in the other Western European countries such as Austria, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom and the whole European Union. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Also in Uruguay, with a significant population in [[Montevideo]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia}}\n{{refimprove|section|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe culture of the people is characterized with both traditionalist and modernist attributes. It is strongly bound with their native land and the surrounding in which they live. The rich cultural heritage of the Macedonians is accented in the folklore, the picturesque traditional folk costumes, decorations and ornaments in city and village homes, the architecture, the monasteries and churches, iconostasis, wood-carving and so on. The culture of Macedonians can roughly be explained as a Balkanic, closely related to that of [[Bulgarians]] and [[Serbs]].\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Robevihouse.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architecture in [[Ohrid]].]]\n[[File:Makedonski Nosii 2.jpg|thumb|right|Macedonian girls in traditional folk costumes.]]\nThe typical Macedonian village house is influelnced by [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman Architecture]] .Presented as a construction with two floors, with a hard facade composed of large stones and a wide balcony on the second floor. In villages with predominantly agricultural economy, the first floor was often used as a storage for the harvest, while in some villages the first floor was used as a cattle-pen.\n\nThe stereotype for a traditional Macedonian city house is a two-floor building with white fa\u00e7ade, with a forward extended second floor, and black wooden elements around the windows and on the edges.\n\n===Cinema and theater===\n{{main|Cinema of North Macedonia}}\n\nThe history of film making in North Macedonia dates back over 110 years. The first film to be produced on the territory of the present-day the country was made in 1895 by [[Manakis brothers|Janaki and Milton Manaki]] in [[Bitola]]. In 1995 [[Before the Rain (1994 film)|Before the Rain]] became the first Macedonian movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 67th Academy Awards {{!}} 1995 |url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1995 |website=Oscars.org {{!}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=27 August 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993 to 1994, 1,596 performances were held in the newly formed republic, and more than 330,000 people attended. The Macedonian National Theater (drama, opera, and ballet companies), the Drama Theater, the Theater of the Nationalities (Albanian and Turkish drama companies) and the other theater companies comprise about 870 professional actors, singers, ballet dancers, directors, playwrights, set and costume designers, etc. There is also a professional theatre for children and three amateur theaters. For the last thirty years a traditional festival of Macedonian professional theaters has been taking place in [[Prilep]] in honor of [[Vojdan \u010cernodrinski]], the founder of the modern Macedonian theater. Each year a festival of amateur and experimental Macedonian theater companies is held in [[Ko\u010dani]].\n\n===Music and art===\n{{main|Music of North Macedonia}}\n\nMacedonian music has many things in common with the music of neighboring [[Balkan]] countries, but maintains its own distinctive sound.\n\nThe founders of modern Macedonian painting included [[Lazar Licenovski]], [[Nikola Martinoski]], [[Dimitar Pandilov]], and [[Vangel Kodzoman]]. They were succeeded by an exceptionally talented and fruitful generation, consisting of [[Borka Lazeski]], [[Dimitar Kondovski]], [[Petar Mazev]] who are now deceased, and [[Rodoljub Anastasov]] and many others who are still active. Others include: [[Vasko Taskovski]] and [[Vangel Naumovski]]. In addition to [[Dimo Todorovski]], who is considered to be the founder of modern [[Macedonian sculpture]], the works of [[Petar Hadzi Boskov]], [[Boro Mitrikeski]], [[Novak Dimitrovski]] and [[Tome Serafimovski]] are also outstanding.\n\n===Economy===\nIn the past, the Macedonian population was predominantly involved with agriculture, with a very small portion of the people who were engaged in trade (mainly in the cities). But after the creation of the People's Republic of Macedonia which started a social transformation based on Socialist principles, a middle and heavy industry were started.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Macedonian language}}\n\nThe Macedonian language ({{lang|mk|\u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a}}) is a member of the Eastern group of [[South Slavic languages]]. [[Standard Macedonian]] was implemented as the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]] after being [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] in the 1940s, and has accumulated a thriving [[Macedonian literature|literary tradition]].\n\nThe closest relative of Macedonian is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]],<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Levinson|O'Leary|1992|p=239}}</ref> followed by [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]. All the [[South Slavic languages]], including Macedonian, form a [[dialect continuum]], in which Macedonian is situated between Bulgarian and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. The [[Torlakian]] dialect group is intermediate between Bulgarian, Macedonian and Serbian, comprising some of the northernmost [[Dialects of the Macedonian language|dialects of Macedonian]] as well as varieties spoken in southern Serbia.\n\nThe [[Macedonian alphabet]] is an adaptation of the [[Cyrillic script]], as well as language-specific conventions of spelling and punctuation. It is rarely [[Romanization of Macedonian|Romanized]].\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church|Roman Catholicism in North Macedonia|Macedonian Greek Catholic Church|Protestantism in North Macedonia|Islam in North Macedonia}}\n[[File:2011 Ochryda, Cerkiew \u015bw. Pantelejmona (02).jpg|thumb|right|250px|One of the well-known monasteries \u2013 [[Saint Panteleimon, Ohrid|St. Panteleimon]] in Ohrid.]]\n\nMost Macedonians are members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]. The official name of the church is Macedonian Orthodox Church \u2013 Ohrid Archbishopric and is the body of Christians who are united under the Archbishop of Ohrid and North Macedonia, exercising jurisdiction over Macedonian Orthodox Christians in the Republic of North Macedonia and in [[exarchate]]s in the [[Macedonian diaspora]].\n\nThe church gained autonomy from the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] in 1959 and declared the restoration of the historic [[Orthodox Archbishopric of Ohrid (ancient)|Archbishopric of Ohrid]]. On 19 July 1967, the Macedonian Orthodox Church declared [[autocephaly]] from the Serbian church. Due to protest from the Serbian Orthodox Church, the move was not recognised by any of the churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Communion]], and since then, the Macedonian Orthodox Church is not in communion with any Orthodox Church.<ref>The encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 3. By Erwin Fahlbusch, Geoffrey William Bromiley. p. 381</ref> A small number of Macedonians belong to the [[Roman Catholic]] and the [[Protestant Church|Protestant]] churches.\n\nBetween the 15th and the 20th centuries, during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], a number of Orthodox Macedonian Slavs converted to Islam. Today in the Republic of North Macedonia, they are regarded as [[Macedonian Muslims]], who constitute the second largest religious community of the country.\n\n===Names===\n{{Main|Culture of North Macedonia#Macedonian names|l1=Macedonian names}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Macedonian cuisine}}\n[[File:\u0413\u0440\u0430\u0432 \u0432\u043e \u0442\u0430\u0432\u0430(\u0442\u0430\u0444\u0447\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0447\u0435) (3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]], the [[national dish]] of Macedonians.]]\nMacedonian cuisine is a representative of the cuisine of the [[Balkans]]\u2014reflecting Mediterranean (Greek) and Middle Eastern (Turkish) influences, and to a lesser extent Italian, German and Eastern European (especially Hungarian) ones. The relatively warm climate in North Macedonia provides excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Thus, Macedonian cuisine is particularly diverse.\n\n[[Shopska salad]], a food from [[Bulgaria]], is an appetizer and side dish which accompanies almost every meal. Macedonian cuisine is also noted for the diversity and quality of its [[dairy products]], wines, and local alcoholic beverages, such as [[rakija]]. [[Tav\u010de Grav\u010de]] and [[mastika]] are considered the national dish and drink of North Macedonia, respectively.\n\n==Symbols==\n: ''See also: [[Flags of North Macedonia]]'', ''[[Symbols of North Macedonia]]''\n\n* '''''Sun''''': The official [[flag of the Republic of North Macedonia]], adopted in 1995, is a yellow sun with eight broadening rays extending to the edges of the red field.\n* '''''Coat of arms''''': After independence in 1991, North Macedonia retained the [[Coat of arms of North Macedonia|coat of arms]] adopted in 1946 by the People's Assembly of the People's Republic of Macedonia on its second extraordinary session held on 27 July 1946, later on altered by article 8 of the Constitution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Macedonia. The coat-of-arms is composed by a double bent garland of ears of wheat, tobacco and poppy, tied by a ribbon with the embroidery of a traditional folk costume. In the center of such a circular room there are mountains, rivers, lakes and the sun. All this is said to represent \"the richness of our country, our struggle, and our freedom\".\n\n'''Unofficial symbols'''\n* '''''[[Golden Lion of North Macedonia|Lion]]''''': The lion first appears in the [[Fojnica Armorial]] from 17th century, where the coat of arms of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is included among those of other entities. On the coat of arms is a crown; inside a yellow crowned lion is depicted standing rampant, on a red background. On the bottom enclosed in a red and yellow border is written \"Macedonia\". The use of the lion to represent Macedonia was continued in foreign heraldic collections throughout the 16th to 18th centuries.<ref>Matkovski, Aleksandar, ''Grbovite na Makedonija'', Skopje, 1970.</ref><ref>\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440 \u041c\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 (1990) \u0413\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u041c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430, Skopje, Macedonia&nbsp;\u2014 {{ISBN|86-15-00160-X}}<br></ref> Nevertheless, during the late 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] arose, which modeled itself after the earlier [[Internal Revolutionary Organization|Bulgarian revolutionary traditions]] and adopted their symbols as the [[Bulgarian lion|lion]], etc.<ref>Duncan M.

However, this symbol is not totally accepted while the state [[coat of arms of Bulgaria]] is somewhat similar.\n* '''''[[Vergina Flag (North Macedonia)|Vergina Sun]]:''''' (official flag, 1992\u20131995) The [[Vergina Sun]] is used unofficially by various  associations and cultural groups in the Macedonian diaspora. The [[Vergina]] Sun is believed to have been associated with [[Greeks|ancient Greek]] kings such as [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], although it was used as an ornamental design long before the Macedonian period. The symbol was discovered in the present-day [[Greece|Greek]] region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Greeks]] regard it as a misappropriation of a [[Greece|Hellenic symbol]], unrelated to Slavic cultures, and a direct claim on the legacy of Philip II.

The Charlestown Arsenal of [[United States Army]] was established in 1794.<ref name=Thomas>{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Matthew|title=Historic Powder Houses of New England: Arsenals of American Independence|date=2013|publisher=[[The History Press]]|page=80}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, in 1800, the land for the Charlestown Navy Yard was purchased by the United States government and the yard itself was established. The yard built the first U.S. [[ship of the line]], {{USS|Independence|1814|6}}, but was primarily a repair and storage facility until the 1890s, when it started to build steel ships for the \"New Navy\". By then, it was called the Boston Navy Yard.\n\nOn 24 June 1833, the staff and dignitaries including then Vice President [[Martin Van Buren]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]], [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Levi Woodbury]], and many Massachusetts officials, witnessed \"one of the great events of American naval history\": the early United States [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution||2}} was inaugurating the first naval [[drydock]] in [[New England]] designed by prominent civil engineer [[Loammi Baldwin, Jr.]]<ref name=\"hnsa\">[http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/carlson.htm Historic Naval Ships Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301102119/http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/carlson.htm |date=1 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Charlestown Ropewalk|ropewalk]] supplied cordage used in the Navy from the time it opened in 1837 until the Yard closed in 1975. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the Yard was downgraded to an Equipment and Recruit Facility.<ref name=\"cnyhist\" />\n\nIn the late 1880s and 1890s, the Navy began expanding again bringing into service new modern steel hulled steam-powered warships and that brought new life to the Yard.  In the first years of the 20th century, a second drydock was added. During [[World War II]] (1939/1941\u20131945), it worked to fix [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] warships and merchant transports damaged by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]] when crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]].  On 27 September 1941\u2014[[Liberty Fleet Day (Victory Fleet Day)|Liberty Fleet Day]]\u2014Boston launched two [[destroyer]]s, USS ''Cowie'' and the USS ''Knight''.  Even before the U.S. entered the Second World War after the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack on 7 December 1941, a month before in November, Boston was one of four United States naval shipyards selected to build {{sclass2-|Captain|frigate|1}}s under the [[Lend-Lease]] military assistance program for the Royal Navy. Since the United States was at war when these ships were finally completed, some were later requisitioned and used by the United States Navy as [[destroyer escort]]s.<ref>Franklin, Bruce Hampton (1999) ''The Buckley-class Destroyer Escorts'' Naval Institute Press {{ISBN|1-55750-280-3}} p.7</ref> In the post war period, the shipyard modified World War II ships for [[Cold War]] (1945\u20131991) service through [[Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization]] (FRAM). The [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953), and [[Vietnam War]] (1964\u20131975) did not bring much work to the yard since it was so far from the fighting.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}<!-- confirm reason -->\n\n==Ships built at Boston Navy Yard==\n[[File:Aerial view of the Boston Naval Shipyard in April 1960.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Boston Navy Yard in April 1960.]]\n[[File:Boston Naval Shipyard 1958.jpg|thumb|The [[South Boston Naval Annex]], circa 1958]]\n* 1814: {{USS|Independence|1814|6}} (90-gun [[ship of the line]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/independence-ii.htm |title=Independence |website=[[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] |publisher=[[United States Navy]] |accessdate=12 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023415/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/i1/independence-ii.htm |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[War of 1812]];

The yard built the first U.S. [[ship of the line]], {{USS|Independence|1814|6}}, but was primarily a repair and storage facility until the 1890s, when it started to build steel ships for the \"New Navy\". By then, it was called the Boston Navy Yard.\n\nOn 24 June 1833, the staff and dignitaries including then Vice President [[Martin Van Buren]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]], [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Levi Woodbury]], and many Massachusetts officials, witnessed \"one of the great events of American naval history\": the early United States [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution||2}} was inaugurating the first naval [[drydock]] in [[New England]] designed by prominent civil engineer [[Loammi Baldwin, Jr.]]<ref name=\"hnsa\">[http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/carlson.htm Historic Naval Ships Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301102119/http://www.hnsa.org/conf2004/papers/carlson.htm |date=1 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Charlestown Ropewalk|ropewalk]] supplied cordage used in the Navy from the time it opened in 1837 until the Yard closed in 1975.

In the first years of the 20th century, a second drydock was added. During [[World War II]] (1939/1941\u20131945), it worked to fix [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] warships and merchant transports damaged by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi Germans]] when crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]].  On 27 September 1941\u2014[[Liberty Fleet Day (Victory Fleet Day)|Liberty Fleet Day]]\u2014Boston launched two [[destroyer]]s, USS ''Cowie'' and the USS ''Knight''.
