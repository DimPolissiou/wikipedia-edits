The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior's Path, which led from the [[Tennessee River]] near the present location of [[Florence, Alabama]], to a point on the [[Black Warrior River]] south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the [[American Indian Wars]] prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the [[Muscogee|Creek people]] westward along the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[Creek War]] in 1813, General [[Andrew Jackson]] of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman [[Davy Crockett]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Fulenwider| first = Dan| url = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| title = Cullman County, Alabama History: The Black Warrior's Path| work = Cullman County, Alabama| accessdate = January 28, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927024240/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| archive-date = September 27, 2009| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the [[Alabama Legislature]] to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy's Cove in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]] to the ghost town of Baltimore on the [[Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River|Mulberry Fork]] near [[Colony, Alabama|Colony]]. The road passed near present-day [[Vinemont, Alabama|Vinemont]] through Cullman, [[Good Hope, Alabama|Good Hope]], and down the current [[Interstate 65]] corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to [[Elyton, Alabama|Elyton]] (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout's Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between [[Blount Springs, Alabama|Blount Springs]] to [[Somerville, Alabama|Somerville]] by way of his homestead in present-day [[Simcoe, Alabama|Simcoe]], and the second road passing west of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]] and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout's Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout's Road to [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of [[U.S. Route 31]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor [[Battle of Day's Gap]]. On April 30, 1863, [[Union Army|Union]] forces under the command of Colonel [[Abel Streight]] won a victory over forces under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day [[Cherokee County, Alabama|Cherokee County]] near present-day [[Gaylesville, Alabama|Gaylesville]]. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest .<ref>{{cite web\n |last         = Partain\n |first        = Rich\n |url          = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |title        = Streight's Raid\n |work         = co.cullman.al.us\n |accessdate   = January 28, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927022749/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |archive-date = September 27, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Col.

Cullmann]], a German immigrant.<ref>Although some sources state that Cullmann had earlier Americanized his name from \"Kullmann,\" Stanley Johnson, his only surviving American descendant, told ''The Cullman Times'' in 1998 that there are no German records indicating the name \"Kullmann\", and that \"Cullmann\" had always been the correct spelling. {{Cite news |title=Cullman: Moving Forward while Treasuring the Past |periodical=The Cullman Times |year=1998}}</ref> Cullmann had been an advocate of democratic reforms in his native [[Bavaria]], having fought and acquired his honorific title \"Colonel\" during the [[German revolutions of 1848\u201349|Revolutions of 1848\u201349]]. After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the [[First Schleswig War]], he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and [[Prussia]], under [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] and his Minister President [[Otto von Bismarck]], began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually [[Unification of Germany|unifying Germany under Prussian rule]] in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing [[American Civil War]], Cullman eventually came to America in 1865.

Over the next twenty years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. [[German language|German]] continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor [[William C.

The region was traversed by a trail known as the Black Warrior's Path, which led from the [[Tennessee River]] near the present location of [[Florence, Alabama]], to a point on the [[Black Warrior River]] south of Cullman. This trail figured significantly in Cherokee history, and it featured prominently in the [[American Indian Wars]] prior to the establishment of the state of Alabama and the relocation of several American Indian tribes, including the [[Muscogee|Creek people]] westward along the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[Creek War]] in 1813, General [[Andrew Jackson]] of the U.S. Army dispatched a contingent of troops down the trail, one of which included the frontiersman [[Davy Crockett]].<ref>{{cite web| last = Fulenwider| first = Dan| url = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| title = Cullman County, Alabama History: The Black Warrior's Path| work = Cullman County, Alabama| accessdate = January 28, 2010| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927024240/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history3.htm#blackwarrior| archive-date = September 27, 2009| url-status = dead| df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s and the 1830s, two toll roads were built linking the Tennessee Valley to present-day [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In 1822, Abraham Stout was given a charter by the [[Alabama Legislature]] to open and turnpike a road beginning from Gandy's Cove in [[Morgan County, Alabama|Morgan County]] to the ghost town of Baltimore on the [[Mulberry Fork of the Black Warrior River|Mulberry Fork]] near [[Colony, Alabama|Colony]]. The road passed near present-day [[Vinemont, Alabama|Vinemont]] through Cullman, [[Good Hope, Alabama|Good Hope]], and down the current [[Interstate 65]] corridor to the Mulberry Fork. The road was later extended to [[Elyton, Alabama|Elyton]] (Birmingham) in 1827. It then became known as Stout's Road. Mace Thomas Payne Brindley was given a charter in 1833 to turnpike two roads, one running between [[Blount Springs, Alabama|Blount Springs]] to [[Somerville, Alabama|Somerville]] by way of his homestead in present-day [[Simcoe, Alabama|Simcoe]], and the second road passing west of [[Hanceville, Alabama|Hanceville]] and east of Downtown Cullman to join Stout's Road north of the city. What later became the Brindley Turnpike became an extension of Stout's Road to [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]]. Cullman later became located between the juncture of the two roads, and they predated the corridor of [[U.S. Route 31]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the future location of Cullman was the site of the minor [[Battle of Day's Gap]]. On April 30, 1863, [[Union Army|Union]] forces under the command of Colonel [[Abel Streight]] won a victory over forces under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. This battle was part of a campaign and chase known collectively as Streight's Raid. Although Streight got the upper hand in this battle, Forrest would have the last laugh. In one of the more humorous moments of the war, Streight sought a truce and negotiations with Forrest in present-day [[Cherokee County, Alabama|Cherokee County]] near present-day [[Gaylesville, Alabama|Gaylesville]]. Although Streight's force was larger than Forrest's, while the two were negotiating, Forrest had his troops march repeatedly in a circuitous route past the site of the talks. Thinking himself to be badly outnumbered, Streight surrendered to Forrest .<ref>{{cite web\n |last         = Partain\n |first        = Rich\n |url          = http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |title        = Streight's Raid\n |work         = co.cullman.al.us\n |accessdate   = January 28, 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090927022749/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history2.htm\n |archive-date = September 27, 2009\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Col.

After the failure of the revolution, Cullmann found himself in financial ruin. In the years to follow, he would try to re-establish himself in business, but after several setbacks, including a great financial loss in the [[First Schleswig War]], he would remain unsuccessful. As time went on and [[Prussia]], under [[William I, German Emperor|King Wilhelm I]] and his Minister President [[Otto von Bismarck]], began to exert more influence in the German region (eventually [[Unification of Germany|unifying Germany under Prussian rule]] in 1871), Cullmann began to believe that his political ideals were fundamentally incompatible with those of the German Government. As a result, he decided to emigrate from his homeland. Settling first in London due to fears that he would be forced to join in the ongoing [[American Civil War]], Cullman eventually came to America in 1865. He moved to Alabama in 1871 and, in 1873, negotiated an agreement to act as agent for a tract of land {{convert|349000|acre|km2}} in size, owned by the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]] Company, on which he established a colony for German immigrants.<ref name=\"founding\">{{cite web\n |last=Johnson \n |first=Stanley \n |url=http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |title=Founding of Cullman \n |work=co.cullman.al.us \n |accessdate=January 28, 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428001839/http://www.co.cullman.al.us/history1.htm \n |archivedate=April 28, 2009 \n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Northern Alabama: Historical and Biographical | url=https://archive.org/details/northernalabamah00birm | year=1888 | place=Birmingham | publisher=Smith & Deland}}</ref>\n\nFive German families moved to the area in March 1873; in 1874, the town was incorporated and named after Colonel Cullmann (with the town name being Americanized to 'Cullman' with one 'n'). Over the next twenty years, Cullmann encouraged around 100,000 Germans to immigrate to the United States, with many settling in the Cullman area. Cullmann drew on his military engineering training in laying out and planning the town. During this period, Cullman underwent considerable growth. [[German language|German]] continued to be widely spoken, and Cullmann himself was the publisher of a German-language newspaper. When Cullmann died in 1895, at the age of 72, his funeral was marked by the attendance of Governor [[William C.

After returning to the United States and finding out that his wife had left him for another man, he re-enlisted and was sent to [[South Korea]]. He was a [[Private First Class]] with a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] unit along the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] between North and South Korea in the early 1960s. Soon after his arrival, he found himself facing a [[court martial]] for forging signatures on paperwork that gave him permission to leave the base which, ultimately, led to his going [[AWOL]] (Absent Without Leave).<ref name=\"60mins\"/>\n\nUnwilling to face punishment, on August 15, 1962, while his fellow soldiers were eating lunch, he ran across a [[minefield]] in broad daylight into North Korean territory, where he was quickly apprehended by North Korean soldiers.

They appeared on magazine covers and used loudspeakers to try to persuade more U.S. soldiers at the border to defect. They did not wish to remain in North Korea indefinitely at first. In 1966, the four men tried to leave North Korea by seeking asylum at the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] embassy in Pyongyang, but the embassy immediately turned them over to North Korean authorities.<ref name=\"60mins\"/> After that, Dresnok decided to settle in North Korea.\n\nBeginning in 1978, he was cast in several [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean films]], including the 20-part series ''[[Unsung Heroes (film)|Unsung Heroes]]'' (as an American villain), and he became a celebrity in the country as a result.

Some elements are directly involved in plant [[metabolism]]. However, this principle does not account for the so-called beneficial elements, whose presence, while not required, has clear positive effects on plant growth.\n\nA nutrient that is able to limit plant growth according to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]] is considered an essential plant nutrient if the plant cannot complete its full life cycle without it. There are 16 essential plant soil nutrients, besides the three major elemental nutrients carbon and oxygen that are obtained by photosynthetic plants from carbon dioxide in air, and [[hydrogen]], which is obtained from water.\n\nPlants uptake essential elements from the [[soil]] through their [[root]]s and from the air (consisting of mainly nitrogen and oxygen) through their [[Leaf|leaves]]. Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.<ref>Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/</ref>\n\nPlant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nutrition|Food|Minerals}}\n* [[Auxology]]\n* [[Exercise]]\n* [[Food preferences in older adults and seniors]]\n* [[Nutrition psychology]]\n* [[Palatability]]\n* [[Physical fitness]]\n* [[Veganism]]\n* [[Vegetarianism]]\n*[https://dietmantrabymonika.com/ Dietitian] \n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Carpenter, Kenneth J.|title=Protein and Energy: A Study of Changing Ideas in Nutrition|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45209-0}}\n* Curley, S., and Mark (1990).

Green plants obtain their carbohydrate supply from the carbon dioxide in the air by the process of [[photosynthesis]]. Carbon and oxygen are absorbed from the air, while other nutrients are absorbed from the soil. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by [[cation exchange]], wherein [[root hair]]s pump [[hydrogen ion]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) into the soil through [[proton pump]]s. These hydrogen ions displace [[cation]]s attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. In the leaves, [[stomata]] open to take in carbon dioxide and expel [[oxygen]]. The carbon dioxide molecules are used as the carbon source in photosynthesis.\n\nAlthough [[nitrogen]] is plentiful in the Earth's atmosphere, very few plants can use this directly. Most plants, therefore, require nitrogen compounds to be present in the soil in which they grow. This is made possible by the fact that largely inert atmospheric nitrogen is changed in a [[nitrogen fixation]] process to biologically usable forms in the soil by bacteria.<ref>Lindemann, W.C. and Glover C.R. (2003) [http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_a/A129/welcome.html Nitrogen Fixation by Legumes]. New Mexico State University/</ref>\n\nPlant nutrition is a difficult subject to understand completely, partially because of the variation between different plants and even between different species or individuals of a given [[cloning|clone]]. Elements present at low levels may cause deficiency symptoms, and toxicity is possible at levels that are too high. Furthermore, deficiency of one element may present as symptoms of toxicity from another element, and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Nutrition|Food|Minerals}}\n* [[Auxology]]\n* [[Exercise]]\n* [[Food preferences in older adults and seniors]]\n* [[Nutrition psychology]]\n* [[Palatability]]\n* [[Physical fitness]]\n* [[Veganism]]\n* [[Vegetarianism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|author=Carpenter, Kenneth J.|title=Protein and Energy: A Study of Changing Ideas in Nutrition|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45209-0}}\n* Curley, S., and Mark (1990).

According to a Deloitte study in August 2008, 90% of employer data is electronically stored information (ESI), and 40% of executives say that data volumes are becoming unmanageable. Unmanageable data makes locating relevant data more challenging which can manifest into significant losses through wasted storage space and reductions in productivity.

This requires employers to monitor employees and establish security measures to prevent employee data theft and misuse of technology. Regulation is a vital component of E-HR because data is considered a form of collateral. Therefore, similar to other capital assets, it becomes a business necessity and fiduciary duty to protect the assets of a company from theft or exploitation.\n\nToday, data theft is known one of the fastest growing [[white-collar crime]]s globally. Unfortunately, a significant source of data theft is employees and former employees because they have access to intellectual property stored on company networks. As a result, preventing data theft is a primary concern of E-HR specialists. Good.\n\n==Related Case Law==\nThere are numerous legal cases that have increased the need for E-HR over the last decade.

The ABS provides key statistics on a wide range of economic, population, environmental and social issues, to assist and encourage informed decision making, research and discussion within governments and the community.\n\n==History==\nIn 1901, statistics were collected by each state for their individual use. While attempts were made to coordinate collections through an annual Conference of Statisticians, it was quickly realised that a National Statistical Office would be required to develop nationally comparable statistics.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS) was established under the Census and Statistics Act in 1905. Sir George Knibbs was appointed as the first Commonwealth Statistician. Initially, the Bureau was located in Melbourne and was attached to the Department of Home Affairs. In 1928, the Bureau was relocated to Canberra and in 1932, it moved to the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury portfolio]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nInitially, the states maintained their own statistical offices and worked together with the CBCS to produce national data. However, some states found it difficult to resource a state statistical office to the level required for an adequate statistical service. In 1924, the Tasmanian Statistical Office transferred to the Commonwealth. On 20 August 1957, the NSW Bureau of Statistics was merged into the Commonwealth Bureau.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureau of Statistics|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/agency/1734|website=Record agency|publisher=NSW State Archives & Records|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref> Unification of the state statistical offices with the CBCS was finally achieved in the late 1950s under the stewardship of Sir Stanley Carver, who was both NSW Statistician and Acting Commonwealth Statistician.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1974, the CBCS was abolished and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was established in its place. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Act in 1975, established the ABS as a [[statutory authority]] headed by the Australian Statistician and responsible to the Treasurer.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/51c9a3d36edfd0dfca256acb00118404/f24771a747e805e9ca256c86007cc61b!OpenDocument |title=History of the ABS |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisational vision and values==\nThe ABS purpose is to \"inform Australia's important decisions by partnering and innovating to deliver relevant, trusted, objective data, statistics and insights\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1005.0~2017-18~Main%20Features~Purpose,%20role,%20strategic%20priorities%20and%20values%20~2|title=Main Features \u2013 Purpose, role, strategic priorities and values|website=www.abs.gov.au|publisher=ABS|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ABS values work in conjunction with the broader Australian Public Service (APS) values<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/values-and-conduct|title=APS Values and Code of Conduct in practice|website=The Australian Public Service Commission (APSC)|accessdate=11 March 2016}}</ref> and include impartiality, commitment to service, accountability, respect and ethical behaviour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1005.0?OpenDocument|title=1005.0 \u2013 ABS Corporate Plan, 2015\u201319|date=|website=Abs.gov.au|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Modernisation==\nFrom 2015 an investment of $250&nbsp;million over five years by the Australian Government<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> is being used to modernise ABS systems and processes, with the aim of delivering the best possible statistical program in more efficient and innovative ways.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Census of population and housing==\nThe ABS undertakes the [[Census in Australia|Australian census]] of population and housing (census).

This was Australia's 17th national census.\n\nThe census of population and housing is the largest statistical collection undertaken by the ABS and one of the most important. The census aims to accurately measure the number of people and dwellings in Australia on census night, and a range of their key characteristics. This information is used to inform public policy as well as electoral boundaries, infrastructure planning and the provision of community services.

House.jpg|thumb|ABS House which is the headquarters for the Australian Bureau of Statistics]]\n\nThe '''Australian Bureau of Statistics''' ('''ABS''') is the independent statistical agency of the [[Government of Australia]]. The ABS provides key statistics on a wide range of economic, population, environmental and social issues, to assist and encourage informed decision making, research and discussion within governments and the community.\n\n==History==\nIn 1901, statistics were collected by each state for their individual use. While attempts were made to coordinate collections through an annual Conference of Statisticians, it was quickly realised that a National Statistical Office would be required to develop nationally comparable statistics.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics (CBCS) was established under the Census and Statistics Act in 1905. Sir George Knibbs was appointed as the first Commonwealth Statistician. Initially, the Bureau was located in Melbourne and was attached to the Department of Home Affairs. In 1928, the Bureau was relocated to Canberra and in 1932, it moved to the [[Department of the Treasury (Australia)|Treasury portfolio]].<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nInitially, the states maintained their own statistical offices and worked together with the CBCS to produce national data. However, some states found it difficult to resource a state statistical office to the level required for an adequate statistical service. In 1924, the Tasmanian Statistical Office transferred to the Commonwealth. On 20 August 1957, the NSW Bureau of Statistics was merged into the Commonwealth Bureau.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bureau of Statistics|url=https://www.records.nsw.gov.au/agency/1734|website=Record agency|publisher=NSW State Archives & Records|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref> Unification of the state statistical offices with the CBCS was finally achieved in the late 1950s under the stewardship of Sir Stanley Carver, who was both NSW Statistician and Acting Commonwealth Statistician.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1974, the CBCS was abolished and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) was established in its place. The Australian Bureau of Statistics Act in 1975, established the ABS as a [[statutory authority]] headed by the Australian Statistician and responsible to the Treasurer.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/D3310114.nsf/51c9a3d36edfd0dfca256acb00118404/f24771a747e805e9ca256c86007cc61b!OpenDocument |title=History of the ABS |publisher=Abs.gov.au |date= |accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisational vision and values==\nThe ABS purpose is to \"inform Australia's important decisions by partnering and innovating to deliver relevant, trusted, objective data, statistics and insights\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/by%20Subject/1005.0~2017-18~Main%20Features~Purpose,%20role,%20strategic%20priorities%20and%20values%20~2|title=Main Features \u2013 Purpose, role, strategic priorities and values|website=www.abs.gov.au|publisher=ABS|language=en|access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe ABS values work in conjunction with the broader Australian Public Service (APS) values<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/values-and-conduct|title=APS Values and Code of Conduct in practice|website=The Australian Public Service Commission (APSC)|accessdate=11 March 2016}}</ref> and include Impartiality, Commitment to Service, Accountability, Respect and Ethical Behaviour.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1005.0?OpenDocument|title=1005.0 \u2013 ABS Corporate Plan, 2015\u201319|date=|website=Abs.gov.au|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Modernisation==\nFrom 2015 an investment of $250&nbsp;million over five years by the Australian Government<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> is being used to modernise ABS systems and processes, with the aim of delivering the best possible statistical program in more efficient and innovative ways.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==Census of population and housing==\nThe ABS undertakes the [[Census in Australia|Australian census]] of population and housing (census).
