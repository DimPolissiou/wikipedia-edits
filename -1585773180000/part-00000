Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation. The first Bussey Institute building was completed in 1871 and served as headquarters for an [[undergraduate]] school of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Mary Jane|date=|title=Benjamin Bussey, Woodland Hill, and the Creation of the Arnold Arboretum|url=http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/pdf/articles/2006-64-1-benjamin-bussey-woodland-hill-and-the-creation-of-the-arnold-arboretum.pdf|journal=Arnoldia|volume=64(1)|pages=2-9|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn June of 1872 [[Charles Sprague Sargent]] was appointed as a professor of horticulture and the curator of the Arnold Arboretum; the following year he was appointed director of both the Arnold Arboretum and the Harvard Botanic Garden.

The land was deeded to the City of Boston in 1882 and incorporated into the \"Emerald Necklace\". Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway. Public transportation to the Arboretum is available on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] to its terminus at [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills Station]] and by bus ([[Green Line \"E\" Branch|#39]]) to the Monument in Jamaica Plain. The Arboretum is within easy walking distance from either of these points.  The Arboretum's southwest gate is very close to the turn between Weld and Walter Streets on the [[51 (MBTA bus)|#51 bus line]] between Cleveland Circle/Reservoir and Forest Hills.

Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962. They comprise four service [[greenhouse]]s totaling 3,744 square feet (348 m\u00b2), the headhouse with offices, cold rooms, storage areas, and a classroom. Staffing at the greenhouse includes the manager of greenhouses and nurseries, the plant propagator, two assistants, and, during the summer months, two horticultural interns. Adjacent to the greenhouse is a shade house of 3,150 square feet (293 m\u00b2), a 12,600 cubic foot (357 m\u00b3) cold storage facility, and three irrigated, inground nurseries totaling approximately one and one-half acres (6,000 m\u00b2). Also located in the greenhouse complex is the bonsai pavilion, where the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]] is displayed from the middle of April to the end of October.

Arnold specified that a portion of his estate was to be used for \"...the promotion of [[Agriculture|Agricultural]], or [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] improvements\". According to the deed of trust between the Arnold trustees and the College, income from Arnold's legacy was to be used for establishing, developing and maintaining an arboretum to be known as the Arnold Arboretum, which \"shall contain, as far as practicable, all the trees [and] shrubs ... either indigenous or exotic, which can be raised in the open air of [[West Roxbury]].\" The historical mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of woody plants through research and to disseminate this knowledge through education.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sargent|first=Charles Sprague|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/71418|title=The first fifty years of the Arnold Arboretum|location=Cambridge, Mass.,}}</ref>\n\nArnold's gift was combined with {{convert|120|acre|km2}} of land that had been donated to Harvard University in 1842. [[Benjamin Bussey]] (1757\u20131842), a prosperous Boston merchant and scientific farmer, donated his country estate ''Woodland Hill'' and a part of his fortune to Harvard University \"for instruction in [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], and related subjects\". Bussey had inherited land from fellow patriot [[Weld Family|Eleazer Weld]] in 1800 and further enlarged his large estate between 1806 and 1837 by acquiring and consolidating various farms that had been established as early as the seventeenth century. Harvard used this land for the creation of the [[Bussey Institute]], which was dedicated to agricultural experimentation.

Under the agreement with the City, Harvard University was given a thousand-year lease on the property, and the University, as trustee, is directly responsible for the development, maintenance, and operation of the Arboretum; the City retains responsibility for water fountains, benches, roads, boundaries, and policing. The annual operating budget of $7,350,644 (fiscal year 2003) is largely derived from the endowment, which is also managed by the University.  All Arboretum staff are University employees. Other income is obtained through granting agencies and contributors.\n\n==Location==\nThe main Arborway gate is located on Route 203 a few hundred yards south of its junction with the Jamaicaway.

Historic collections include the plant introductions from eastern Asia made by [[Charles Sprague Sargent]], [[Ernest Henry Wilson]], [[William Purdom]], [[Joseph Hers]], and [[Joseph Rock]]. Recent introductions from Asia have resulted from the 1977 Arnold Arboretum Expedition to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], the 1980 Sino-American Botanical Expedition to western [[Hubei Province]], and more recent expeditions to [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Taiwan]].\n\nComprehensive collections are maintained and augmented for most genera, and genera that have received particular emphasis include: ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Beech|Fagus]]'', ''[[Carya]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Taxodium]]'', ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Metasequoia]]'', ''[[Lonicera]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Malus]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Rhododendron]]'', ''[[Syringa]]'', ''[[Paulownia]]'', ''[[Albizia]]'', ''[[Ilex]]'', ''[[Gleditsia]]'' and ''[[Tsuga]]''. Other comprehensive collections include the Bradley Collection of [[Rosaceae|Rosaceous]] Plants, the collection of [[conifer]]s and dwarf conifers, and the [[Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection]]. Approximately 500 accessions are processed annually.\n\n== Collections policy ==\n[[File:ArnoldArboretumBirch20040415-01s.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[birch]] tree in early spring]]\nThe mission of the Arnold Arboretum is to increase knowledge of the [[evolution]] and biology of woody plants. Historically, this research has investigated the global distribution and evolutionary history of trees, shrubs and vines, with particular emphasis on the disjunct species of [[East Asia]] and North America. Today this work continues through molecular studies of the evolution and bio-geography of the floras of temperate Asia, North America and [[Europe]].\n\nResearch activities include molecular studies of gene evolution, investigations of plant-water relations, and the monitoring of plant phenology, vegetation succession, nutrient cycling and other factors that inform studies of environmental change. Applied work in horticulture uses the collections for studies in plant propagation, plant introduction, and environmental management. This diversity of scientific investigation is founded in a continuing commitment to acquire, grow, and document the recognized species and infraspecific [[taxa]] of [[Woody plant|ligneous plants]] of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] that are able to withstand the climate of the Arboretum's {{convert|281|acre|km2|adj=on}} Jamaica Plain/Roslindale site.\n\nAs a primary resource for research in plant biology, the Arboretum's living collections are developed, curated, and managed to support scientific investigation and study. To this end, acquisition policies place priority on obtaining plants that are genetically representative of documented wild populations. For each taxon, the Arnold Arboretum aspires to grow multiple accessions of known wild provenance in order to represent significant variation that may occur across the geographic range of the species. Accessions of garden or cultivated provenance are also acquired as governed by the collections policies herein.\n\nFor all specimens, full documentation of both provenance and history within the collection is a critical priority.  Curatorial procedures provide for complete and accurate records for each accession, and document original provenance, locations in the collections, and changes in botanical identity. [[Herbarium]] specimens, [[DNA]] materials, and [[digital images]] are gathered for the collection and maintained in Arboretum data systems and the herbarium at the Roslindale site.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch on plant pathology and integrated pest management for maintenance of the living collections is constantly ongoing. Herbarium-based research focuses on the systematics and biodiversity of both temperate and tropical Asian forests, as well as the ecology and potential for sustainable use of their resources. The Arboretum's education programs offer school groups and the general public a wide range of lectures, courses, and walks focusing on the ecology and cultivation of plants. Its quarterly magazine, [https://web.archive.org/web/20091007133215/http://arnoldia.arboretum.harvard.edu/static/home ''Arnoldia''], provides in-depth information on horticulture, botany, and garden history.

Currently the Arboretum utilizes a suite of [http://www.esri.com/ ESRI] Desktop and Mobile [http://www.gis.com/ GIS] software applications to manage, analyze, query, capture, manipulate, and display geographic information. A computer-driven embosser generates records labels. All accessioned plants in the collections are labeled with accession number, botanical name, and [[cultivar]] name (when appropriate), source information, common name, and map location. Trunk and/or display labels are also hung on many accessions and include botanical and common names and nativity.  Stake labels are used to identify plants located in the Leventritt Garden and Chinese Path.\n\n==Grounds maintenance==\nThe grounds staff consists of the manager of horticulture, three [[arborists]], ten horticultural technologists, a foreman, and a gardener. During the summer months ten horticultural interns supplement the grounds staff. A wide array of vehicles and modern equipment, including an aerial lift truck and a [[John Deere]] backhoe and front loader, are used in grounds maintenance. Permanent grounds staff, excluding the manager, are members of [[AFL/CIO]] Local 615, Service Employees International Union ([http://www.seiu.org/ SEIU]).\n\n==Nursery and greenhouse facilities==\nThe [http://arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/collections-management/propagation-distribution/ Dana Greenhouses], located at 1050 Centre Street (with a mailing address of 125 Arborway), were completed in 1962.

During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford.

The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]].

It is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, when this area was part of St Albans' Abbey's manor of cashio. In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

district|borough]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England, {{convert|15|mi}} northwest of [[central London]].\n\nThe town developed on the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|River Colne]] on land belonging to [[St Albans Abbey]] until the 16th century. During the 12th century a charter was granted allowing a market, and the building of [[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church]] began. The town grew partly due to travellers going to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A [[mansion]] was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another [[country house]] was built at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].\n\nThe [[Grand Junction Canal]] in 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] in 1837 resulted in Watford's rapid growth, with paper-making mills such as [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson]] at Croxley, influencing the development of printing in the town. Two brewers, [[Benskins]] and [[Sedgwicks Brewery|Sedgwicks]], amalgamated and flourished in the town until their closure in the late 20th century. [[Hertfordshire County Council]] designates Watford to be a major sub-regional centre. Several head offices  are based in Watford. Both the 2006 [[World Golf Championship]] and the [[2013 Bilderberg Conference]] took place at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]].<ref name=\"guardian.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/02/week-ahead-bilderberg-2013-watford|title=The week ahead: Bilderberg 2013 comes to&nbsp;... the Grove hotel, Watford|author=Charlie Skelton|work=the Guardian}}</ref>\n\nWatford became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]] and a [[municipal borough]] by grant of a charter in 1922. The borough, which had 90,301 inhabitants at the time of the 2011 census, is separated from [[Greater London]] to the south by the parish of [[Watford Rural]] in the [[Three Rivers (district)|Three Rivers District]]. [[Watford Borough Council]] is the [[local authority]] with the [[Mayor of Watford]] as its head; one of only 18 [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. Watford elects one [[Member of parliament|MP]] for the [[Watford (UK Parliament constituency)|Watford constituency]]. Prior to the establishment of this constituency in 1885, the area was part of the three-seat constituency of [[Hertfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Hertfordshire]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Watford.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Church, Watford|St Mary's Church, Watford]]]]\n[[File:Essex Chapel, Saint Mary's Watford.jpg|thumb|The Essex Chapel in Saint Mary's Church]]\nThere is evidence of some limited prehistoric occupation around the Watford area, with a few Celtic and Roman finds, though there is no evidence of a settlement until much later.<ref name=forsyth>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fY-Yoru2dTQC&pg=PA276 |title=A County of Small Towns: The Development of Hertfordshire's Urban Landscape|editor=T.

It is not mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, when this area was part of St Albans' Abbey's manor of cashio. In the 12th century the Abbey was granted a charter allowing it to hold a market here and the building of St Mary's Church began. The settlement's location helped it to grow, since as well as trade along this north-south through route it possessed good communications into the vale of [[St Albans]] to the east and into the Chiltern Hills along the valley of the [[River Chess]] to the west. The town grew modestly, assisted by travellers passing through to [[Berkhamsted Castle]] and the royal palace at [[Kings Langley]]. A big house was built at [[Cassiobury House|Cassiobury]] in the 16th century. This was partly rebuilt in the 17th century and another substantial house was built nearby at [[The Grove, Watford|The Grove]]. The houses were expanded and developed throughout the following centuries.

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought the [[Grand Junction Canal]] (now [[Grand Union Canal]]) from 1798 and the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] from 1837, both located here for the same reasons the road had followed centuries before, seeking an easy gradient over the Chiltern Hills. The land-owning interests permitted the canal to follow closely by the river Gade, but the prospect of smoke-emitting [[steam train]]s drove them to ensure the railway gave a wide berth to the Cassiobury and Grove estates. Consequently, although the road and canal follow the easier valley route, the railway company was forced to build an expensive tunnel under [[Leavesden, Hertfordshire|Leavesden]] to the north of the town.\n[[File:Watford, The old railway station house - geograph.org.uk - 981561.jpg|thumb|left|St Albans Road railway station  (1837)]]\n[[Watford railway station (1837-1858)|Watford's original railway station]] opened in 1837 on the west side of St Albans Road, a small, single-storey red-brick building.

The Grand Union Canal, allowed coal to be brought into the district and paved the way for industrial development. The Watford Gas and Coke Company was formed in 1834 and gas works built. The canal allowed paper-making mills to be sited at Croxley. The [[John Dickinson Stationery|John Dickinson and Co.]] mill beside the canal manufactured the Croxley brand of fine quality paper.

During [[World War II]] the prints were taken over by the government who used them to print propaganda. After the war, the printing industry began going into decline.

It is derived from 'Caegshoe', which is believed to be the combination of 'caeg', a person's name, and 'hoe', meaning a spur of land. When the land was granted to Sir Richard Morrison in the 16th century, it was called 'Cayshobury', with 'bury' indicating a manor.<ref name=\"forsyth\"/><ref name=\"Page-Manors\"/>\n\n[[Cassiobury Park]] was formed from the grounds of [[Cassiobury House]] and consists of {{convert|190|acre|km2}} of open space.
