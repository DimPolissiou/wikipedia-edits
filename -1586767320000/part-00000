Soon, children who were born with the Gastrea virus and obtained superhuman abilities as a result, are discovered and dubbed \"Cursed Children\". Due to the Gastrea virus' intervention, the Cursed Children could only be female. Civil Securities are formed to specialize fighting against Gastrea, operating with the pair of an Initiator, who are cursed children, and a Promoter, serving to lead the cursed children. Ten years after the epidemic, Rentar\u014d Satomi, a high school student who is also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security Agency owned by his childhood friend Kisara Tend\u014d, along with his Initiator, Enju Aihara, conducts missions to prevent the destruction of the Tokyo Area and the world.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Tend\u014d Civil Security===\n;{{Nihongo|Rentar\u014d Satomi|\u91cc\u898b \u84ee\u592a\u90ce|Satomi Rentar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-24/chris-patton-luci-christian-star-in-black-bullet-english-dub/.93348|title=Chris Patton, Luci Christian Star in ''Black Bullet'' English Dub|website=Anime News Network|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Rentar\u014d is the protagonist, a second year student in Magata High School and also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security. Rentar\u014d's parents died in the war against Gastrea ten years ago, and was adopted by the Tend\u014d family, but left the family along with Kisara. Rentar\u014d lost his right leg, right arm and left eye in a fight with Gastrea to protect Kisara, and was saved by Doc's \"New Human Creation Plan\" which replaced his lost limbs with Varanium. Due to his kind and sincere nature Rentaro is one of the few sympathizers of the cursed children. He usually goes to extreme lengths to help them. This trait also leads many cursed children to either take an interest in him or become infatuated with him. He uses an [[HS2000|XD]] and is a beginner in Tend\u014d style martial arts in the beginning of the story.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enju Aihara|\u85cd\u539f \u5ef6\u73e0|Aihara Enju}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Enju is a Cursed Child, and is Rentar\u014d's Model Rabbit Initiator in Tend\u014d Civil Security. She lives with Rentar\u014d and goes to  primary school normally until her status as a Cursed Child was revealed during the incident involving Kagetane Hiruko, and was forced to transfer to a new school. When first introduced to Rentar\u014d by the International Initiator Supervising Organization (IISO), Enju had severe trust problems, but this has since improved through getting along with Rentar\u014d and eventually becoming infatuated with him despite her young age. She is a fan of the ''Tenchuu Girls'' anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kisara Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u6728\u66f4|Tend\u014d Kisara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kisara is the president of Tend\u014d Civil Security. Originally from the Tend\u014d clan, she left the family after a certain conflict along with her childhood friend Rentar\u014d.

Believing that her parents' deaths were connected to the Tend\u014d family, she swore to avenge them and has been searching for the murderers. She is extremely skilled at the Tend\u014d style of martial arts, but is unable to fight for extended periods of time due to her condition. Kisara has feelings for Rentar\u014d, who has shown the attraction to be mutual, but their attempts to communicate their feelings towards one another are usually interrupted, most of the time by Enju. However, her obsession with exacting revenge on the Tend\u014d clan is a source of concern for Rentar\u014d, who fears it may one day lead to them parting ways.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tina Sprout|\u30c6\u30a3\u30ca\u30fb\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c8|Tina Supurauto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyo Kurosawa]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Tina is a product of Ayn Rand's mechanized soldiers and his Model Owl Initiator.

Soon, children who were born with the Gastrea virus and obtained superhuman abilities as a result, are discovered and dubbed \"Cursed Children\". Due to the Gastrea virus' intervention, the Cursed Children could only be female. Civil Securities are formed to specialize fighting against Gastrea, operating with the pair of an Initiator, who are cursed children, and a Promoter, serving to lead the cursed children. Ten years after the epidemic, Rentar\u014d Satomi, a high school student who is also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security Agency owned by his childhood friend Kisara Tend\u014d, along with his Initiator, Enju Aihara, conducts missions to prevent the destruction of the Tokyo Area and the world.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Tend\u014d Civil Security===\n;{{Nihongo|Rentar\u014d Satomi|\u91cc\u898b \u84ee\u592a\u90ce|Satomi Rentar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaji]]|[[Chris Patton]]<ref name=\"eng cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-09-24/chris-patton-luci-christian-star-in-black-bullet-english-dub/.93348|title=Chris Patton, Luci Christian Star in ''Black Bullet'' English Dub|website=Anime News Network|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>}}\n:Rentar\u014d is the protagonist, a second year student in Magata High School and also a Promoter in Tend\u014d Civil Security. Rentar\u014d's parents died in the war against Gastrea ten years ago, and was adopted by the Tend\u014d family, but left the family along with Kisara. Rentar\u014d lost his right leg, right arm and left eye in a fight with Gastrea to protect Kisara, and was saved by Doc's \"New Human Creation Plan\" which replaced his lost limbs with Varanium. Due to his kind and sincere nature Rentaro is one of the few sympathizers of the cursed children. He usually goes to extreme lengths to help them. This trait also leads many cursed children to either take an interest in him or become infatuated with him. He uses an [[HS2000|XD]] and is a beginner in Tend\u014d style martial arts in the beginning of the story.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Enju Aihara|\u85cd\u539f \u5ef6\u73e0|Aihara Enju}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Luci Christian]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Enju is a Cursed Child, and is Rentar\u014d's Model Rabbit Initiator in Tend\u014d Civil Security. She lives with Rentar\u014d and goes to  primary school normally until her status as a Cursed Child was revealed during the incident involving Kagetane Hiruko, and was forced to transfer to a new school. When first introduced to Rentar\u014d by the International Initiator Supervising Organization (IISO), Enju had severe trust problems, but this has since improved through getting along with Rentar\u014d and eventually becoming infatuated with him despite her young age. She is a fan of the ''Tenchuu Girls'' anime.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kisara Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u6728\u66f4|Tend\u014d Kisara}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Yui Horie]]|[[Christina Kelly]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kisara is the president of Tend\u014d Civil Security. Originally from the Tend\u014d clan, she left the family after a certain conflict along with her childhood friend Rentar\u014d. Kisara's kidneys are barely functioning due to the trauma of witnessing her parents being eaten alive by Gastrea. Believing that her parents' deaths were connected to the Tend\u014d family, she swore to avenge them and has been searching for the murderers. She is extremely skilled at the Tend\u014d style of martial arts, but is unable to fight for extended periods of time due to her condition. Kisara has feelings for Rentar\u014d, who has shown the attraction to be mutual, but their attempts to communicate their feelings towards one another are usually interrupted, most of the time by Enju. However, her obsession with exacting revenge on the Tend\u014d clan is a source of concern for Rentar\u014d, who fears it may one day lead to them parting ways.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tina Sprout|\u30c6\u30a3\u30ca\u30fb\u30b9\u30d7\u30e9\u30a6\u30c8|Tina Supurauto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyo Kurosawa]]|[[Caitlynn French]]<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Tina is a product of Ayn Rand's mechanized soldiers and his Model Owl Initiator.

She has an IQ of 210 but is unsuited to front-line battles. During her mission to eliminate the Hiruko pair, she was separated from Sh\u014dgen and met Rentar\u014d. As she protected the area from Gastrea led by the Hiruko pair's battle, the amount of Gastrea virus in her body exceeded the critical value, thus she requested Rentar\u014d to shoot her while she was still human.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Takuto Yasuwaki|\u4fdd\u8107 \u5353\u4eba|Yasuwaki Takuto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Subaru Kimura]]|Scott Gibbs}}\n:Seitenshi's personal guard who is conceited and unhappy about Rentar\u014d being hired as part of Seitenshi's protection squad from Tina's assassination attempts.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kazumitsu Tend\u014d|\u5929\u7ae5 \u548c\u5149|Tend\u014d Kazumitsu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kazuyuki Okitsu]]|Houston Hayes<ref name=\"eng cast\" />}}\n:Kazumitsu is one of Kisara's four brothers who conspired against their parents, leading to their deaths.

reprehensible, singling out the portrayal of [[#Characters|Enju Aihara]] as otaku bait; Bamboo Dong and Carl Kimlinger similarly praised it for being decently written and leaving enough room for story and character developments, the former saying that it might get better with later episodes while the latter criticized it for being the same as every other anime of its ilk; Rebecca Silverman said that the premise had intrigue with visuals that catch the eyes' attention but it needs to work on its pacing and story developments to reach its potential. The fifth reviewer, Theron Martin, while finding the story schematics generic and filled with otaku trappings was hopeful because of the technical aspects that complement the action scenes and the sense of intrigue throughout, concluding that \"it looks like it could be an entertaining (if not necessarily original) action romp, especially if the kinks get ironed out.\"<ref name=\"BB Ep 1 Review\"/> [[Kotaku]]'s Richard Eisenbeis was negative towards the series, saying it had a good concept but was bogged down by an amalgam of genres that don't go together, follows a formulaic blueprint set by other anime series and is filled with plot holes that require a suspension of disbelief, concluding that, \"In the end, I simply would not recommend ''Black Bullet'' to anyone.

He often invites listeners to participate on the air. Most of his music sets are organized on a theme or story-line, such as Old West outlaws, beautiful women, fast cars, or politics. He also takes listener requests; sometimes such a request will inspire an entire set.\n\nHe had three theme-based shows every week, on Monday, Wednesday and Sunday nights. On Monday, Jim featured the Blues on 'MOJO MONDAY' from 10&nbsp;pm to 11&nbsp;pm.  On Wednesday at midnight, he performed an hour-long, uninterrupted segment called \"Headsets.\" This is a theme-based collage of music blended seamlessly together, with one song leading into the next, incorporating sound effects such as voice overs and quotes from movies relating to the theme. On this program Ladd creates what he calls the \"Theater of The Mind\" (headphones are recommended). In addition to music, the weekly \"Headsets\" show featured poetry performed and written by spoken word artists such as Helene Hodge and Victoria Cyr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfte.org/interviews/headsets303.html|title=Conversation with Billy Sherwood and Jim Ladd|publisher=Notes from the Edge|author=Tiano, Mike|date=November 11, 2007}}</ref> There have been two \"Headsets\" albums released, both done in collaboration with [[Billy Sherwood]].\n\nSunday night began at 9&nbsp;pm PT (to Midnight), a theme show called \"Theme of Consciousness\", where Ladd played listeners' requests for songs based on a single word or phrase, such as \"colors\", \"fire\", \"dance\".

After two years there, he moved to Los Angeles station [[KLOS]]. In 1974 he moved to [[KMET (FM)|KMET]], known to its legions of listeners as \"The Mighty Met\", where he would remain for most of the next 13 years (returning to KLOS in 1984, but going back to KMET again, 2 months before they changed format), while also hosting and producing ''Innerview'', an hour-long nationally syndicated interview program that aired during the same period.\n\nAfter what many listeners and people in the industry perceived as a long steady decline in the station's output, attributed by most accounts to the station's decision to bring in consultant [[Lee Abrams]] and the strict \"album-oriented rock\" formatting he favored, KMET management shocked southern California and all of radio by abruptly dumping rock music, the call letters, and the entire air staff on February 14, 1987, becoming [[KTWV]] (\"The Wave\"), featuring a [[new age]] format with no DJs at all.\n\n=== Jumping station to station, and side projects ===\nIn 1987, Ladd appeared on [[Pink Floyd]] bassist [[Roger Waters]]' second solo album ''[[Radio K.A.O.S.]]'', portraying a fictional disk jockey named DJ Jim who talks to the album's protagonist, a handicapped boy named Billy.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cashmere |first=Paul |url=http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=1463 |title=Songwriter Jim Wagner Calls Tom Petty A Liar \u2013 Undercover.fm News |publisher=Undercover.com.au |date=January 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027070401/http://www.undercover.com.au/News-Story.aspx?id=1463 |archive-date=October 27, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ladd joined Waters on the tour that followed, and appeared in the three music videos for the album.

Ladd's work has also been featured in major motion pictures such as ''[[Tequila Sunrise (film)|Tequila Sunrise]]'', ''Rush'', ''[[She's Out of Control]]'', and ''[[Defendor]]'' starring [[Woody Harrelson]].\n\nFor several years, Ladd worked only on-and-off on the radio because he refused to follow a playlist, as most station owners demanded. In the late 1980s, Ladd worked at [[KMPC-FM (defunct)|KMPC-FM]], where he helped to shape its \"Full Spectrum Rock\" blend of classic and modern rock, and was enthusiastic about its rebranding as KEDG \"the Edge\" in March 1989, but was laid off when the station abruptly abandoned its rock format two months later.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.socalradiohistory.com/kmpcfm.html |title=KMPC-FM 101.9: Full Spectrum Rock |author=Gene Autry |accessdate=August 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 Ladd released a semi-autobiographical book titled ''Radio Waves: Life And Revolution On The FM Dial'' (St. Martin's Press), based on his radio career and the rise and fall of [[Freeform (radio format)|freeform]] rock radio in LA, from the genesis of freeform on the West Coast through the demise of KMET in 1987. The names of many people and radio stations Ladd encountered during that two-decade period were swapped for pseudonyms; however, [[Raechel Donahue]] has said that she insisted Ladd use her real name and that of her late husband [[Tom Donahue]] in the book.

It was their 33rd consecutive season in the top flight of Swiss football after they won promotion during the season 1945\u201346. They played their home games in the [[St. Jakob Stadium]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[Helmut Benthaus]] was first team manager for the thirteenth consecutive season. Basel played in the [[1978\u201379 Nationalliga A]] They ended the qualification round in fourth position and finished the Championship Group in sixth position with 18 points, 17 behind championship winners [[Servette FC|Servette]]. They scored a total of 54 goals conceding 53 in 32 games. [[Detlev Lauscher]] was the team's top goal scorer with 10 league goals.\n\nIn the first round of the [[Swiss Cup]] Basel were drawn against [[FC Glattbrugg]] and this was the first time that these two teams had played against each other. The game was played on 7 October 1978 and Basel won 7\u20130. In the second round Basel were drawn away to [[FC Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]] and in the third round away against [[Neuch\u00e2tel Xamax|Xamax]]. In the first round of the  [[Swiss League Cup]] Basel were drawn against [[FC Grenchen|Grenchen]]. In a two legged affair, winning the home game and losing away game, Basel won 4\u20133 on aggregate. Basel won in the round of 32 against [[FC Nordstern Basel|Nordstern Basel]], in the quarter-final against [[FC Luzern|Luzern]] and in the semi-final against Xamax to reach the final, which was played on 5 May 1979 against [[FC Servette|Servette]]. After extra time the score was 2\u20132, but Servette won 4\u20133 on penalties.\n\nIn the [[1978\u201379 UEFA Cup]] Basel were drawn against VfB Stuttgart. The first game was lost 2\u20133 in [[St. Jakob Stadium]] and the away game in the [[Neckarstadion]] was lost 1\u20134.
