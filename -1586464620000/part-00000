However, the Dover Museum consider that the [[Dover Bronze Age Boat]] is the oldest seagoing boat known, at only 1550&nbsp;BC, as the lack of a rocker bottom and pointed prow on the Ferriby boats is deemed by some to have made them too unstable for sea crossings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dovermuseum.co.uk/Bronze-Age-Boat/Bronze-Age-Boat.aspx |accessdate=18 September 2014|title=Bronze Age Boat The world's oldest known seagoing boat |publisher=Dover Museum}}</ref>  This is contested though: The Oakleaf reproduction of the Ferriby boats (pictured) was given a pointed bow and the Ferriby boats are described by the museum that houses them as having curved rocker bottoms, which qualifies them as similar to the later Dover boat in their seagoing abilities.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 1==\nIn 1937, the first boat, known as Ferriby Boat&nbsp;1 (or F1), was discovered by Ted and Will Wright, on the shore of the Humber.<ref name=plaque>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Ferriby_Boats_-_geograph.org.uk_-_442080.jpg |title=Plaque of memorial|work=Geograph| accessdate= 11 August 2011}}</ref> It was a boat bottom with one end almost complete. What remained was 5.7&nbsp;feet (1.7&nbsp;m) wide and over 43&nbsp;feet (13.17&nbsp;m) long, the planks mostly 3\u20134&nbsp;inches thick. It was part of an [[oak]]en three-[[strake]] flat rockered-bottom boat which had been stitched together with [[Taxus baccata|yew]] [[withy|withies]], caulked with moss and capped with watertight oak laths. It has room for up to eighteen paddles and has been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to between 1880 and 1680&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 2==\nSixty yards upstream, Ted Wright found the end of a second boat-plank in 1940.<ref name=plaque/> This has become known as Ferriby Boat&nbsp;2 (or F2). It is a twin-planked centre-strake dated to between 1940 and 1720&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 3==\nIn 1963, part of a third boat was discovered, again by Ted Wright, this time in the company of one of his sons, Roderick, and excavated adjoining Ferriby Boat&nbsp;1. The remains consist of part of an outer bottom-strake and associated side-strake; many years later (in the late 1990s), scientists from Oxford were able to demonstrate that the third boat dated from as far back as 2030&nbsp;BC, by the analysis of samples of the boat using accelerator mass spectrometry.\n\nTed Wright had formulated this theory much earlier, as set out in his book \"The Ferriby Boats: Seacraft of the Bronze Age\", published in 1990.\n\n==Display==\nThe original boats were excavated in 1946 and unfortunately had to be cut up to be moved. They were housed in the Archaeological Gallery of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], but are now in the care of Hull  Museums. Details concerning the boats can be found on an information board on Ferriby foreshore, on a public footpath that forms part of the [[Trans Pennine Trail]].\n\n==Replicas==\nTwo different replicas have been made of the Ferriby Boats.\n\n===Oakleaf===\nIn 2002-2003, Edwin Gifford and his team that included Richard Darrah built and sailed a half-size reconstruction of a Ferriby boat in Southampton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riven-oak.appspot.com/bronzeage.html#ferriby |title=The Ferriby Boat|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>  They have experimented with using a sail; although there is no evidence of a sail in the originals, they successfully rigged a square sail to Oakleaf. Oakleaf was then acquired by the Ferriby Heritage Trust in 2008, and it is now kept at Ferriby.\n\n===Morgawr===\nIn 2012\u201313, the [[Morgawr (boat)|''Morgawr'']], a full-scale fully functional reconstruction (replica) of the Ferriby 1 boat, was built at the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]] in Falmouth, as a collaborative effort between the National Maritime Museum and the [[University of Exeter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-21681465/shaky-maiden-voyage-for-replica-bronze-age-boat|title=Shaky maiden voyage for replica Bronze Age boat|date=6 March 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> Launched on 6 March 2013 into Falmouth Harbour, ''Morgawr'' was an [[experimental archaeology]] endeavour to learn about Bronze Age boat building techniques (replica bronze tools of the Age were used) and to test the nautical capabilities of the craft.

However, the Dover Museum consider that the [[Dover Bronze Age Boat]] is the oldest seagoing boat known, at only 1550&nbsp;BC, as the lack of a rocker bottom and pointed prow on the Ferriby boats is deemed by some to have made them too unstable for sea crossings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dovermuseum.co.uk/Bronze-Age-Boat/Bronze-Age-Boat.aspx |accessdate=18 September 2014|title=Bronze Age Boat The world's oldest known seagoing boat |publisher=Dover Museum}}</ref>  This is contested though: The Oakleaf reproduction of the Ferriby boats (pictured) was given a pointed bow and the Ferriby boats are described by the museum that houses them as having curved rocker bottoms, which qualifies them as similar to the later Dover boat in their seagoing abilities.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 1==\nIn 1937, the first boat, known as Ferriby Boat&nbsp;1 (or F1), was discovered by Ted and Will Wright, on the shore of the Humber.<ref name=plaque>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Ferriby_Boats_-_geograph.org.uk_-_442080.jpg |title=Plaque of memorial|work=Geograph| accessdate= 11 August 2011}}</ref> It was a boat bottom with one end almost complete. What remained was 5.7&nbsp;feet (1.7&nbsp;m) wide and over 43&nbsp;feet (13.17&nbsp;m) long, the planks mostly 3\u20134&nbsp;inches thick. It was part of an [[oak]]en three-[[strake]] flat rockered-bottom boat which had been stitched together with [[Taxus baccata|yew]] [[withy|withies]], caulked with moss and capped with watertight oak laths. It has room for up to eighteen paddles and has been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to between 1880 and 1680&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 2==\nSixty yards upstream, Ted Wright found the end of a second boat-plank in 1940.<ref name=plaque/> This has become known as Ferriby Boat&nbsp;2 (or F2). It is a twin-planked centre-strake dated to between 1940 and 1720&nbsp;BC.\n\n==Ferriby Boat 3==\nIn 1963, part of a third boat was discovered, again by Ted Wright, this time in the company of one of his sons, Roderick, and excavated adjoining Ferriby Boat&nbsp;1. The remains consist of part of an outer bottom-strake and associated side-strake; many years later (in the late 1990s), scientists from Oxford were able to demonstrate that the third boat dated from as far back as 2030&nbsp;BC, by the analysis of samples of the boat using accelerator mass spectrometry.\n\nTed Wright had formulated this theory much earlier, as set out in his book \"The Ferriby Boats: Seacraft of the Bronze Age\", published in 1990.\n\n==Display==\nThe original boats were excavated in 1946 and unfortunately had to be cut up to be moved. They were housed in the Archaeological Gallery of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], but are now in the care of Hull  Museums. Details concerning the boats can be found on an information board on Ferriby foreshore, on a public footpath that forms part of the [[Trans Pennine Trail]].\n\n==Replicas==\nTwo different replicas have been made of the Ferriby Boats.\n\n===Oakleaf===\nIn 2002-2003, Edwin Gifford and his team that included Richard Darrah built and sailed a half-size reconstruction of a Ferriby boat in Southampton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riven-oak.appspot.com/bronzeage.html#ferriby |title=The Ferriby Boat|accessdate=18 September 2014}}</ref>  They have experimented with using a sail; although there is no evidence of a sail in the originals, they successfully rigged a square sail to Oakleaf. Oakleaf was then acquired by the Ferriby Heritage Trust in 2008, and it is now kept at Ferriby.\n\n===Morgawr===\nIn 2012\u201313, the [[Morgawr (boat)|''Morgawr'']], a full-scale fully functional reconstruction (replica) of the Ferriby 1 boat, was built at the [[National Maritime Museum Cornwall]] in Falmouth, as a collaborative effort between the National Maritime Museum and the [[University of Exeter]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-21681465/shaky-maiden-voyage-for-replica-bronze-age-boat|title=Shaky maiden voyage for replica Bronze Age boat|date=6 March 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 September 2019}}</ref> Launched on 6 March 2013 into Falmouth Harbour, ''Morgawr'' was an [[experimental archaeology]] endeavour to learn about Bronze Age boat building techniques (replica bronze tools of the Age were used) and to test the nautical capabilities of the craft.

To track the evolving relationship between campaigning and governing, Doherty examines the strategic choices that presidents make and what those choices reveal about presidential priorities. He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

He focuses on the rise in presidential fundraising and the targeting of key electoral states throughout a president's term in office \u2013 illustrating that recent presidents have disproportionately visited those states that are important to their political prospects while largely neglecting those without electoral payoff.

The first season of 26 episodes began airing on 30 October 2008, and new episodes would continue to air into January 2010 on [[France 3]]. The show is animated with [[Adobe Flash]] software; all the production is done in [[France]] except the special episodes \"Noximilien l'Horloger\" and \"Ogrest, la L\u00e9gende\", both produced in [[Japan]]. The series is directed by Anthony \"Tot\" Roux, and character design is directed by Xavier \"Xa\" Houssin and Kim \"Tcho\" Etinoff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://serie.wakfu.com/fr/coulisses/character-designer|title=''Making of''|accessdate=December 20, 2009|publisher=Ankama Animation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230081454/http://serie.wakfu.com/fr/coulisses/character-designer|archive-date=December 30, 2009|url-status=dead|language=French}}</ref>\n\nA spin-off called ''Mini-Wakfu'', which features humorous shorts with characters depicted in super deformed style has aired since September 2009. The special episode \"Noximilien l'Horloger\", the origin story of the main antagonist, Nox, was produced in Japan and features a radically different art style made by the same team of animators who worked on ''[[Kaiba]]'' and ''[[Kemonozume]]''. The episode was directed by Eunyoung Choi with [[Masaaki Yuasa]] on character design.

He has lived with his adoptive father Alibert, working alongside him at his inn, and has no memories of his real family. He has the ability to summon teleportation portals by rotating his hand in a circular motion and throwing them to where he would like to appear. As the series progresses, he learns other abilities, such as moving at high speeds and creating beams from his portals. Near the end of Season Two, it's revealed that he is the King of the Eliatropes.  In the Special Episodes following the second season, Yugo is shown to have not aged in 6 years since the quest of the Crimson Claws, a fact that depresses him as he wishes to be able to court Amalia, but fears that his childlike appearance would hinder any chance of a serious relationship with her.  The finale shows Yugo is able to utilize the 6 Eliatrope Dofus to attain godly power in an effort to defeat Ogrest but doing so costs him his brother's friendship and nearly destroys the world.\n:In Season 3, it is shown that Yugo and Ruel have been trying to find Adamai everywhere, to no avail. When Adamai, using their psychic link, shows Yugo the seeming death of Percedal, Yugo rushes to help his friend, still unable to believe his brother could be capable of such evil. It's later revealed that his actions later brought about the birth of the season's antagonist, Oropo, who is an evil counterpart of Yugo. During the final battle with Oropo, joined by Percidal and a now realized Adamai, he and his friends are last seen in the realm of the gods.\n\n:;Az\n::A \"Tofu\" (bird) that is always seen by Yugo's side.\n\n;Princess Amalia Sheran Sharm\n:''Voiced by'': Adeline Chetail (French); [[Jessica Bell]] <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Known as the Adventurer-Princess, she is a 13-year-old [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. Because of this, she is able to talk to plants as well as control them. She is devoted to her friends and to helping Yugo find his family. Later, near the end of season one, it is revealed that she dislikes and has many disputes with her brother Armand. The Special Episodes 6 years after season two show Amalia has taken her mother's position as Queen of the Sadida and her forced marriage to Count Harebourg of Frigost begins the story. Though she initially accepts his proposal, she avoids the agreement after learning the Count planned to use the Sadida forests as a fuel source for his kingdom. By the finale, Amalia and Yugo have shown a strong desire to be with each other, in spite of the difficulties caused by the difference in their races. As of Season 3, Amalia has withdrawn from society and rarely leaves her sick father's side, but agrees to leave to look for Percedal with Yugo when he comes asking for help. The strain of their relationship is tested throughout their adventure. By the end of the final battle, Amalia hugs Yugo who returns it with a kind smile. Amalia is David Kawena's wife.\n\n;Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove (also nicknamed Dally in the English dub), ''(Messire Tristepin de Percedal, lit.

He acts brave but foolhardy and is a strong fighter. As a Guardian, Percedal is responsible for making sure Rubilax does not escape its sword prison and possess its owner, or others, though when he is possessed by Rubilax he becomes a monster that is incredibly physically strong. He is questing with Yugo as repayment for Yugo's rescuing him from Rubilax's possession. As the series progresses, he falls in love with Evangelyne and she with him, which later leads to them getting married. He becomes a father to twins, Elely and Flopin in the Special episodes and is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Iop God, but he loses his powers during the fight with Ogrest when he loses his right arm. In Season 3, Percedal is living with Eva and their two children, training Elely (who more Iop-ish and like her father) in the art of fighting. When assassins attack them to steal the children and a pregnant Eva, Percedal and his family fight them off but when Adamai shows up, he is no match for him. Dropped off a cliff, Percedal almost dies and makes a deal with Rubilax to release him if he helps him save his family. While he fought to save Evangelyne and Flopin, he is forced to fight his former master as the replacement Iop God chosen by Oropo.\n\n:;Rubilax\n::''Voiced by'': G\u00e9rard Surugue (French); Keir Stewart <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Doug Erholtz]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n::A Shushu, or a demon trapped in an object, in the form of a gem on the hilt of Percedal's sword. He is obsessed with destruction and lends strength to any being he possesses. He is usually in the form of a [[dagger]] but can grow to the size of a [[longsword]]. His true form is a knee-high demon, however, he is still incredibly strong for his size and grows bigger every time he is hit. Rubilax can also create a small army of strong clay warrior-clones. As his time with the Brotherhood progresses, he eventually grows attached to the group, enough so to rebel against his own kind. In Season 3, Adamai shatters the sword, damaging Rubilax. As Percedal lays dying, Rubilax makes a deal with him to release the Shushu after he helps him save his family - turning into Percedal's missing right arm, able to take any shape. However, Ruel notes that upon their Guardian's death a Shushu would be released, hinting that Rubilax made the deal to save Percedal's life.\n\n;Evangelyne\n:''Voiced by'': Genevi\u00e8ve Doang (French); [[Jules de Jongh]] <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Kira Buckland]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small><ref>{{cite tweet|user=rinachan|author=Kira Buckland|number=980452270360932353|title=I am so ecstatic to be taking on the role of Evangelyne for #wakfu season 3 on Netflix!

She is committed to her job but also acts as an older sister to the young Amalia. She wields a [[bow (weapon)|bow]] that can fire a variety of magic arrows, making a [[quiver]] unnecessary. At first, she shows no attraction to Percedal but as the series progresses she admits that she loves him and starts a family with him by the time of the Special Episodes, marrying him at the end. In Season 3, it is revealed that Eva is pregnant and living with Percedal and their two children, Elely and Flopin. When assassins attack them, she fights back but she and Flopin are captured and taken by Adamai. Before the final battle, she is forced to give birth and, with help from Echo and Flopin, she safely gives birth to a second son, one whose powers were a threat to Oropo throughout the remainder of the season.\n\n:;Junior\n::A pig-like mole creature called a dhreller, which are said to be usual pets of Enutrofs. When he started to tag along, Ruel would try to drive it away. It is later revealed it is because after the death of his first drheller, Kamasu-Tar, he did not wish to have another one. It isn't until he saves Ruel from a Sadida prison that Ruel starts to show a liking to him, and now he is regularly by his side. Ruel later teaches him how to identify minerals through tasting rocks and tracks.\n\n;Ruel Stroud\n:''Voiced by'': Patrick Bethune (French); Hugo Chandor <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Keith Silverstein]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Ruel is an old friend of Yugo's adoptive father Alibert, as well as a treasure- and bounty-hunter known as an [[Dofus#Characters classes|Enutrof]]. As a favor to Alibert, Ruel agrees to accompany Yugo on his travels. Ruel is greedy and stingy. He is skilled as a fighter and is committed to seeing Yugo through the trouble. Ruel wields a gold-plated shovel as a weapon. In season 3, it's revealed he's a demi-god son of Enutrop and targeting by the Siblings into joining their group, much like Sadlygrove's and Evangelyne's kids. Also, he has an estranged wife, Arpagone, who is with the Siblings.\n\n;Adama\u00ef\n:''Voiced by'': Dorothee Pousseo (French); [[Joanna Ruiz]] <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Cristina Valenzuela]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:A shape-shifting dragon who comes into contact with Yugo during their visit to the island of Oma and is revealed to be Yugo's brother, born of the same dofus. After separating from his friends, Yugo trains alongside Adama\u00ef in order to control his wakfu and stop Nox from his sinister plans. Following the Special Episodes, Adama\u00ef has severed ties with Yugo and the Brotherhood, after Yugo attacked him in order to utilize the Eliatrope Dofus to challenge Ogrest.  His current whereabouts are unknown, except that he is now allied with the Forgotten Brotherhood, led by Lady Echo. In Season 3, it is revealed that Adamai joined Lady Echo's brotherhood of other god-offsprings, and now has a more adult looking half-humanoid, half-dragon form. He also stole the three Eliatrope Dofus from Goultard and attached them to his back, gaining incredible powers - he effortlessly defeats Percedal and tosses him off a cliff, sharing the scene via a mind-like with Yugo. He is after Percedal's kids, them being offspring of a god as well, so they can join the Brotherhood. However, after realizing that Oropo's plan involved letting the Elia Cube absorb the Dofu eggs, transforming it into a bomb powerful enough to destroy the worlds, Adamai betrays Oropo and sides with Yugo to fight back. He is last seen with his friends again after they fled to the realm of the gods before Oropo.\n\n;Grufon ('''Skribble''' in the English dub)\n:''Voiced by'': Damien Da Silva (French); Taylor Clarke-Hill (English)\n:A minor Shushu, who has been trapped inside a map. In the beginning, he would only show the group where to go if they flattered him, but he would never give them proper directions. He was later eaten by an Arachnee (a spider-like creature) but ended up possessing the Arachnee and attacking the group. After being captured, Yugo promised to be Skribble's guardian if he would let them go. Skribble agreed and has since then been more agreeable to show the proper way.\n\n;Elely & Flopin\n:''Elely voiced by'': Caroline Lallau (French); [[Jules de Jongh]] <small>''(OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Cristina Valenzuela]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:''Flopin voiced by'': Karl-Line Heller (French); Julie-Ann Dean <small>''(OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, Marcy Edwards <small>''(Season 3)''</small><ref>{{cite tweet|user=MarcyTheBeast|author=Marcy Edwards|number=980301214708477953|title=Hey guyz!

When their parents and the other members of the Brotherhood were held hostage by Count Harebourg, they stormed the palace to rescue them. Flopin used his mom's bow to help free the Brotherhood while Elely merged with Rubilax to give them a fighting chance, with their fighting skills impressing their parents. After the climactic battle Yugo and Percedal have with Ogrest, and after Ogrest returned to a normal baby ogre, Elely was the first person in ages to make friends with him. In Season 3, the kids have grown slightly. Elely is a lot like her father, training hard and is shown to be able to defeat an opponent many time her size \"using her head\" - for pummeling them to submission. Flopin is the more reserved and bookish of the kids, being more like his mother. He ends up captured alongside her by Adamai but both later escape and they reunite with the rest of their family. Like his Adoptive father [[Steven Universe]]\n\n===Secondary characters===\n\n====Sadida====\nThey are a humanoid species who are close to all things [[Mother Nature]], and are most noticeable for being [[barefoot]], green hair, dark skin, and wearing clothes made out of leaves.

He is a jolly man as well as not familiar with formalities despite his king status, always questioning why Eva would always bow before him. He temporarily left his post to Armand when the Tree of Life was sick, trying to cure it. He later regains his throne after being informed of Nox's plan by Amalia and Eva. In Season 3, it is revealed the King is gravely ill and confined to his bed, and expects to die soon.\n\n;Queen Sheran Sharm\n:She died before the start of the story. The king says that Amalia is the spitting image of her, both stubborn and adventurous. However, she appears in Evangeline's dream in her time at the Tree of Life\n\n;Prince Armand Sheran Sharm\n:''Voiced by'': Cedric Dumond (French); James Nickerson <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small>, [[Doug Erholtz]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Amalia's Brother and acting ruler of the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]] while the king is away. He is an arrogant man and believed the warning about Nox from his sister was nothing but her own imagination. He is attracted to Evangelyne, something that creeps her out and causes Percedal to become jealous. Armand also appears to have a racist view towards [[Dofus#Characters classes|Iops]], often insulting them. He is known to have very bad breath, a subject he is very touchy about, though is well known to the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. Despite all this, however, it is shown he truly does care for his little sister. In Season 3, due to the king's illness, Armand has all but taken over the throne and is constantly annoyed by how his sister does not care about politics. He is married to an Osamodas princess and is trying to marry off Amalia as well.\n\n;Chamberlain Toufdrue\n:''Voiced by'': G\u00e9rard Surugue (French); Eric Meyers (English)\n\n;Canar & Renate\n:''Canar voiced by'': Arnaud Laurent (French); Taylor Clarke-Hill (English)\n:''Renate voiced by'': Damien Da Silva (French); Eric Meyers (English)\n\n====Other====\n;Alibert\n:''Voiced by'': Thierry Mercier (French); Joe Mills (English)\n:Yugo's adoptive father, who found him as a baby when Grougaloragran left him at the beginning of the series.

He raises Yugo for 12 years, training him as an assistant chef at the inn's restaurant, until the day their hometown comes under attack by a mysterious enemy and Yugo's past must be revealed.\n\n;Cleophee ('''Cleome''' in the English dub)\n:''Voiced by'': Maryne Bretieaux (French); [[Joanna Ruiz]] (English)<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Evangelyne's younger sister. She is a [[tomboy]] and more easy going than her older sister. She was in the Cra military and is a skilled fighter who works well with Percedal in hand to hand combat, which seems to make Evangelyne worried that Percedal might like Cleophee more than her. After the battle on the Crimson Claws, she sailed back home to Cra City with Elaine and Black Ink. Cleophee is Yugo's Stepmother.\n\n;Grougaloragran\n:''Voiced by'': [[Benoit Allemane]] (French); Tom Clarke Hill (English)\n:A mysterious old man who cares for the infantile Yugo and later must hide him from the dangerous Nox. He is incredibly strong with the ability to breathe fire. Nox on their first battle stated he was a dragon, where in episode 17 it is revealed he is a powerful dragon in human form. He also has the powers to see into people's souls, which is why he picked Alibert for Yugo's father, as he saw he would be the perfect father.\n\n;Master Goultard\n:''Voiced by'': [[Bruno Choel]] (French); Anthony Adonis <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small>, [[Ben Pronsky]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Percedal's \"dead\" Iop master who trained him. Though he commented he was dead, he states \"death was overrated\" when he is shown to be alive. He refers to Percedal as \"Dally-o\". He is a very powerful Iop, able to take down Rubilax's possessed form with a single strike of his sword, as well as he is the only being Rubilax has been shown to be afraid of. He gets Percedal back on his path after he was depressed over breaking Evangelyne's bow. It is later revealed in his fight with Rushu that he has become the new Iop god. After defeating Ogrest, Yugo leaves the three Eliatrope Dofus in Goultard's care, but in Season 3 it is revealed Adamai stole them.\n\n;Master Joris\n:''Voiced  by'': Yoann Sover (French); Eric Meyers (English)\n:A small mysterious man whose face is hidden by his hood. He is a representative of the King of Bonta who came to discuss matters with Armand, who simply brushed him off.

Chibi was also the first king of the Eliatropes.  Mina and Phaeris were priests and diplomats, known for resolving conflicts that emerged among the people.  Chibi and Mina were also secret lovers.  Yugo and Adamai were great explorers and warriors, charged with protecting the Eliatropes and leading them in battle.  Yugo also succeeded Chibi as king.

They served loyally for many years, but Qilby was eventually driven mad by boredom and rebelled, forcing a bloody campaign against a mechanoid race known as the Mechasme that nearly led to the extinction of the Eliatrope race before Yugo and Phaeris were able to imprison Qilby for his crimes.  Apart from this, the First Born are shown to be capable of immense power and judging by the special episodes, aged at a far slower rate than their peers.\n\n===Antagonists===\n\n====Main====\n;Nox\n:''Voiced by'': Benjamin Pascal (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] <small>''(Season 1)''</small>, [[Kaiji Tang]]<ref>{{cite tweet|user=KaijiTang|author=Kaiji Tang|number=980291413953974272|title=Are you a fan of #Wakfu? The Season 3 English Dub is hitting Netflix this week ( though it's totally already out on the French Netflix )! Honored to provide the new voice of Nox and the voice of Black Bump!

A [[Dofus#Characters classes|Xelor]] with twisted and obsessive motives. At the beginning of season one, he encounters Grougaloragran in the guise of a human and is initially surprised by his high levels of Wakfu, Nox is swiftly immobilized and has since been searching for Grougaloragran on his travels, as well as any other large sources of Wakfu to absorb. Nox quickly proves to be a dangerous enemy and often speaks with an insane-sounding giggle at the end of each sentence. It is revealed early on that he needs a large quantity of Wakfu for an item known as the Eliacube, which in his insanity, he believes is alive, and that it speaks to him. He plans to use the Wakfu to go back in time and undo a great wrong that he has done, where because of this he sees everything he does at this present time as reversible and doesn't hesitate to kill anyone in his way, eventually going after the Tree of Life; however, killing the Tree of Life, would effectively wipe out the entire Sadida race as They share the same life-force as the Tree. He appears to have had a family at one time, as evidenced by his constant mention of them. In the end, despite absorbing Wakfu for over 200 years he was only able to go back 20 minutes in time; and upon discovering this he falls to his knees and grieves at the fact he will never be able to save his family. His last words are a farewell to Yugo before teleporting away...No longer supported by the Eliacube, or Nox's will to live, his body withers and turns to dust by his family's grave.\n:His past was revealed in a special episode, where he used to be a kind well muscular father figure named '''Noximilien Coxen''' with a flair for inventing and great skills as a [[Horologist]]. He was a good father and loved his wife and children more than anything, but was depressed at the fact he could not provide financially for his family, often having to negotiate with a man over his debt. While playing with his family on the beach, Igol runs away and discovers the cave that held the Eliacube. Noximilien takes it to his workshop and tinkers with it, amazed at the possibilities the device has, he becomes obsessed with researching the cube to the point of abandoning everything else. His health deteriorates and he hints that he [[insomnia|no longer sleeps]]; these serve to degrade his body to a skeletal state. His family also leaves him; by the time he leaves his workshop to present his work to his wife, his home is shown to be barren and dilapidated, and a note shows that his wife has moved to live with her sister, telling him to come join them if he's ever ready. Before he receives the chance, he is told they have perished in a flood in their new home. In a desperate state, he plunges deeper into his research, seeking a means to turn back time and correct his mistake. This obsession drives him increasingly insane, eventually creating the main antagonist seen in the Wakfu series. With his past revealed, becomes more of a [[sympathetic villain]].\n:He and season 2 villain Qilby return in Season 3 as a phantom that torments Yugo psyche.\n\n:;Marama, Frisco, and Tartufo (I, II and III)\n::Three of Nox's minions, which he refers to as his \"favorites.\" They are first seen during his fight with Grougaloragran and...although their exact nature is unknown, they appear to be a mummified [[Dofus#Characters classes|Cra, Feca, and Sacrier]], and possess most of those classes' respective powers. They are all destroyed in the final battle. Defeated by Adama\u00ef and Yugo, Marama is finally destroyed by Raze-time; Frisco and Tartufo are destroyed by Amalia.\n\n:;Weedkilios\n::Nox's minion, and a [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]] analog to I, II, and III. His appearance is very different, being that of a dead and decayed [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. His eyes are sunken and lifeless, his limbs are [[emaciated]], and his upper body appears to be supported only by a black, spine-like structure. Much of his apparent bulk seems to come from his wood armor. he is frozen by Evangelyne and destroyed by Amalia.\n\n:;XII Raze-time\n::Appears to be a large, boxy clockwork robot created by Nox, and one of his most powerful weapons. Before being confronted by the main characters, it devastated a large section of the [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadidas]]' forest with its \"stasis blasts.\" He was deactivated for good when Nox's clock is destroyed.\n\n:;Igole\n::A [[hyena]]-like Bow Wow (species of dog in that world) that served Nox. Igole can travel at extremely fast speeds (most likely given to him by his control collar) and has the ability to run on water to get from island to island when traveling over-sea. He can also inhale so deeply that he creates a vacuum. It is revealed Igole was previously a pet owned by a little girl who is later revealed to have been Nox's daughter, who drowned due to Ogrest's tears along with the rest of his family. A little Osamodas girl named Lotie that resembled her caused Igole to change his ways, and soon he was freed from Nox's control and now lives with her. She also calls him Crazy-Eyes. In the prequel, he was drawn as a dog. This is because Igole is a Bow Wow by species, a type of dog analog in the Wakfu universe.\n\n;Qilby\n:''Voiced by'': Erik Colin <small>''(Season 2)''</small>, Laurent Morteau <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] <small>''(Season 2)''</small>, [[Joe Ochman]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n: Qilby is the main antagonist of season two and the central villain of the series overall. He was accidentally summoned from the blank dimension when Yugo tried to harness the power of the Eliacube, when he comes to the world of Twelve he explains the origins of his species (through half-truths) and sends Yugo on a quest to acquire the Dofus (dragon egg) of his sister dragon, Shinonome. His true plan is eventually revealed \u2013 that the quest was large to distract Yugo so he could regain his power, steal back the Eliacube and then absorb the Wakfu of the planet to power his ship so he can continue to explore the Krozmos (the process would destroy the planet). He is finally defeated by Yugo, Elatrops children, and Shinonome (who refuses to help brother's foolish. Yugo sends him back in the blank dimension. While originally quiet, friendly and softspoken his personality changes drastically when he fuses with the Eliacube becoming cruel, sadistic, maniacal and manipulative.\n\n:It is unknown whether this is a result of the Eliacube warping his personality or if it is his true colors. The true source of his madness was his gift/curse: his eternal memory. No matter how many times he's reborn, he always remembers. This leads him to begin driven mad by boredom since there was nothing left to learn. Also, another source of his madness was his fear of being alone, which led to his actions that started the Mechanism war, forcing the Eliatropes to abandon their old homeworld.\n\n:He has all the same Powers as Yugo though many of them are more advanced versions, as well as an assortment of other Wakfu abilities, he also has full knowledge of the Eliacube and its workings (Nox spent 200 years just trying to figure out how to work it) makes him even more dangerous than Nox, he is also able to remember his past lives which are unique to his species and implied to be the source of his knowledge and madness, which he later stated was a curse. He is unquestionably the most powerful and dangerous villain in the series so far, with the possible exception of Rushu and Oropo. He and Season 1 villain Nox return as phantoms to torture Yugo.\n\n====ShuShus'====\n;Rushu\n:''Voiced by'': [[Marc Alfos]] (French); [[Jimmy Hibbert]] (English)\n:The tyrannical king of all Shushus. A 10-meter tall fiery demon, he is from another world, one that has mostly been destroyed down to rock and ash. He is looking for a way to enter the World of Twelve, so full of light and life, that he and his demons can keep destroying things. His powers are said to be equal to that of a god and include, super strength, pyrokinesis, telekinesis, and others as well. In the season 2 finale, his true form was revealed to be a grayish-black humanoid with a single eye (it was said his fiery form is just for show). During the battle of Crimson Claws archipelago, he was sent back to the ShuShu realm.\n\n;Anathar\n:''Voiced by'': Antoine Tome (French); Joe Mills <small>''(Most Appearances)''</small>, Keir Stewart <small>''(Episode 34)''</small> (English)\n:A Shushu with the power to copy the ability of anyone he touches. Originally a bound shushu, he was released by his guardian and refused to be unsummoned. After being freed by the Brotherhood of Tofu, Remington releases him to distract the heroes; he quickly realizes this is a bad idea. Yugo uses his portal magic to attack Anathar, which he is then able to use much more powerfully than Yugo, such as generating a hundred portals at once. He is so powerful, he even opened up a portal into the Shushu realm. Through his actions, it would seem this power has a time limit for how long he can use it. He participates in the final battle in possing Adama\u00ef against Yugo, but he is betrayed and threatened of destruction by Qilby, he decides to leave him to take care of Adamai and Yugo, Qilby accepts and spares Anathar. His final fate is unknown, he is presumed killed by Qilby when he tried to kill him for having insulted but it is possible that he is escaped and hid somewhere. Anathar and Ombrage are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.\n\n;Ombrage ('''Shadowfang''' in the English dub)\n:''Voiced by'': Malvina Germain (French); Fiona Clarke (English)\n:A Shushu imprisoned in a ring, she has the power to steal a person's shadow, which appears to represent the target's soul, and turns them into a ghoul. However, she is unable to do this if the target lacks any darkness in their heart. She is first met in a ruined town, where she has taken over her guardian's spirit, who goes by the name Vampyro. After being defeated, her guardian swears never to fall for her tricks again. She returns in season 2 as an ally of Rubilax. Once Percedal is returned to his body, though, she is left behind, ignored by her guardian. In the closing scenes, however, an unknown figure picks her up. Ombrage and Anathar are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.\n\n====The Brotherhood of the Forgotten/The Siblings====\nThe main antagonists of season 3. A secret Guild where all the members are demigods or children of Dragons, thus they are semi-immortal. Their stated goal is to replace their parents and become the new gods of the World of Twelve, believing that the gods don't care about them and that the world has become horribly corrupt under their rule. They threw down the gauntlet against the Brotherhood of Tofu in Season 3 because their leader, Oropo, desires both the Percedal family children and Ruel to join their new pantheon. Furthermore, he has an unspecified need for Yugo's help as well in his plan. To that end, he is using the weaknesses and doubts in the characters to try to bring them to his side. However, later episodes reveal that not everyone in The Siblings fully trusts their leader and some begin to move on their own.\n\n;Oropo\n:''Voiced by'': Franck Lorrain (French); [[Christopher Corey Smith]] (English)\n:The mysterious leader who appears in a large cloak with an owl-like mask. Oropo believed that the current gods are lazy and selfish, and wants them to be replaced by The Siblings. Oropo is very calm and persuasive individual, able to win others to his side with these traits. He claims to hate violence and chaos, and is lenient on others despite what he considers flaws in their personalities. He also follows the principles of the end justifying the means, and that sacrifice is necessary for change. He refers to himself as a non-existence.\n\n:At the end of season 3 where he is revealed to be the last of the Eliotropes, a shadow-clone race accidentally created by Yugo in his image before he fought Ogrest. Once his identity is revealed, he shows a dark version side of himself. He identifies the same traits in Yugo and longs to replace him and be the \"real\" Yugo. Despite wanting to save the world, his ultimate plan still involves destroying all life on the planet, to eliminate the prayers going to the gods, making them vanish. He had no qualms about lying, using, or manipulating others and excused his actions or hypocritically shifted blame onto someone else. His actions, his reasons, and his extremes make Oropo no better than the gods he wishes to destroy.\n\n:Deep down, Oropo knows his actions and reasons for doing them are wrong and selfish, and he truly loved the Siblings, considering them his family, and he had been in love with Echo. His greatest flaw had been his obsession with becoming the \"real Yugo\", to take Yugo's place, and joining the Brotherhood of the Tofu, whom he saw as family because of the feelings and memories he'd inherited from Yugo that blinded him to the love and devotion of Echo and his friends until it was too late.\n\n:Oropo is extremely powerful, able to bend time and space in the creation of his multi-dimensional tower of dreams. Furthermore, he has somehow gained possession of the Eliacube which can make its user as strong as a god. He is also able to enter people's minds through the cracks of their doubts and fears. When his people, the Eliotrope, dies, their Wakfu would transfer into Oropo, making him hold all the Wakfu of his once dead race.\n\n;Dame Echo\n:''Voiced by'': [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bizot]] (French); Julie-Ann Dean <small>''(OVAs)''</small>, [[Cherami Leigh]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:The second in command of The Siblings, meant to replace her mother Eniripsa. Echo is the face of the guild whenever Oropo isn't around.

Adamai gained a taller body and even more powerful abilities after draining the Eliatrope Dofus, becoming even darker and villainous, willing to kill his former friends.\n\n;Sipho\n:''Voiced by'': Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Vl\u00e9rick (French); Taylor Clarke-Hill <small>''(OVA)''</small>, [[Keith Silverstein]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Child of a dragon, used as a spy.\n\n;Count Harebourg\n:''Voiced by'': Sylvain Aga\u00ebsse (French); [[Jimmy Hibbert]] (English)\n:A Xelor demigod who is a master of time and ice magic.

While he refuses to talk, Yugo confiscates his recall potions which the Brotherhood of the Tofu uses to go after the kidnappers.

He promises Eva that he won't trick her if she saves him, however, when he gets to the ledge, he tries to kill her with a sword Shushu.

He has lived with his adoptive father Alibert, working alongside him at his inn, and has no memories of his real family. He has the ability to summon teleportation portals by rotating his hand in a circular motion and throwing them to where he would like to appear. As the series progresses, he learns other abilities, such as moving at high speeds and creating beams from his portals. Near the end of Season Two, it's revealed that he is the King of the Eliatropes.  In the Special Episodes following the second season, Yugo is shown to have not aged in 6 years since the quest of the Crimson Claws, a fact that depresses him as he wishes to be able to court Amalia, but fears that his childlike appearance would hinder any chance of a serious relationship with her.  The finale shows Yugo is able to utilize the 6 Eliatrope Dofus to attain godly power in an effort to defeat Ogrest but doing so costs him his brother's friendship and nearly destroys the world.\n:In Season 3, it is shown that Yugo and Ruel have been trying to find Adamai everywhere, to no avail. When Adamai, using their psychic link, shows Yugo the seeming death of Percedal, Yugo rushes to help his friend, still unable to believe his brother could be capable of such evil. It's later revealed that his actions later brought about the birth of the season's antagonist, Oropo, who is an evil counterpart of Yugo. During the final battle with Oropo, joined by Percidal and a now realized Adamai, he and his friends are last seen in the realm of the gods. Yugo is Lilo Pelekai's husband.\n\n:;Az\n::A \"Tofu\" (bird) that is always seen by Yugo's side.\n\n;Princess Amalia Sheran Sharm\n:''Voiced by'': Adeline Chetail (French); [[Jessica Bell]] <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Known as the Adventurer-Princess, she is a 13-year-old [[Dofus#Characters classes|Sadida]]. Because of this, she is able to talk to plants as well as control them. She is devoted to her friends and to helping Yugo find his family. Later, near the end of season one, it is revealed that she dislikes and has many disputes with her brother Armand. The Special Episodes 6 years after season two show Amalia has taken her mother's position as Queen of the Sadida and her forced marriage to Count Harebourg of Frigost begins the story. Though she initially accepts his proposal, she avoids the agreement after learning the Count planned to use the Sadida forests as a fuel source for his kingdom. By the finale, Amalia and Yugo have shown a strong desire to be with each other, in spite of the difficulties caused by the difference in their races. As of Season 3, Amalia has withdrawn from society and rarely leaves her sick father's side, but agrees to leave to look for Percedal with Yugo when he comes asking for help. The strain of their relationship is tested throughout their adventure. By the end of the final battle, Amalia hugs Yugo who returns it with a kind smile. Amalia is David Kawena's wife.\n\n;Sir Percedal of Sadlygrove (also nicknamed Dally in the English dub), ''(Messire Tristepin de Percedal, lit.

He acts brave but foolhardy and is a strong fighter. As a Guardian, Percedal is responsible for making sure Rubilax does not escape its sword prison and possess its owner, or others, though when he is possessed by Rubilax he becomes a monster that is incredibly physically strong. He is questing with Yugo as repayment for Yugo's rescuing him from Rubilax's possession. As the series progresses, he falls in love with Evangelyne and she with him, which later leads to them getting married. He becomes a father to twins, Elely and Flopin in the Special episodes and is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Iop God, but he loses his powers during the fight with Ogrest when he loses his right arm. In Season 3, Percedal is living with Eva and their two children, training Elely (who more Iop-ish and like her father) in the art of fighting. When assassins attack them to steal the children and a pregnant Eva, Percedal and his family fight them off but when Adamai shows up, he is no match for him. Dropped off a cliff, Percedal almost dies and makes a deal with Rubilax to release him if he helps him save his family. While he fought to save Evangelyne and Flopin, he is forced to fight his former master as the replacement Iop God chosen by Oropo.\n\n:;Rubilax\n::''Voiced by'': G\u00e9rard Surugue (French); Keir Stewart <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Doug Erholtz]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n::A Shushu, or a demon trapped in an object, in the form of a gem on the hilt of Percedal's sword. He is obsessed with destruction and lends strength to any being he possesses. He is usually in the form of a [[dagger]] but can grow to the size of a [[longsword]]. His true form is a knee-high demon, however, he is still incredibly strong for his size and grows bigger every time he is hit. Rubilax can also create a small army of strong clay warrior-clones. As his time with the Brotherhood progresses, he eventually grows attached to the group, enough so to rebel against his own kind. In Season 3, Adamai shatters the sword, damaging Rubilax. As Percedal lays dying, Rubilax makes a deal with him to release the Shushu after he helps him save his family - turning into Percedal's missing right arm, able to take any shape. However, Ruel notes that upon their Guardian's death a Shushu would be released, hinting that Rubilax made the deal to save Percedal's life.\n\n;Evangelyne\n:''Voiced by'': Genevi\u00e8ve Doang (French); [[Jules de Jongh]] <small>''(Season 1-2 & OVAs)''</small><ref name=\":0\" />, [[Kira Buckland]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small><ref>{{cite tweet|user=rinachan|author=Kira Buckland|number=980452270360932353|title=I am so ecstatic to be taking on the role of Evangelyne for #wakfu season 3 on Netflix!

At first, she shows no attraction to Percedal but as the series progresses she admits that she loves him and starts a family with him by the time of the Special Episodes, marrying him at the end. In Season 3, it is revealed that Eva is pregnant and living with Percedal and their two children, Elely and Flopin.

Nox quickly proves to be a dangerous enemy and often speaks with an insane-sounding giggle at the end of each sentence. It is revealed early on that he needs a large quantity of Wakfu for an item known as the Eliacube, which in his insanity, he believes is alive, and that it speaks to him. He plans to use the Wakfu to go back in time and undo a great wrong that he has done, where because of this he sees everything he does at this present time as reversible and doesn't hesitate to kill anyone in his way, eventually going after the Tree of Life; however, killing the Tree of Life, would effectively wipe out the entire Sadida race as They share the same life-force as the Tree. He appears to have had a family at one time, as evidenced by his constant mention of them. In the end, despite absorbing Wakfu for over 200 years he was only able to go back 20 minutes in time; and upon discovering this he falls to his knees and grieves at the fact he will never be able to save his family.

His family also leaves him; by the time he leaves his workshop to present his work to his wife, his home is shown to be barren and dilapidated, and a note shows that his wife has moved to live with her sister, telling him to come join them if he's ever ready. Before he receives the chance, he is told they have perished in a flood in their new home.

A little Osamodas girl named Lotie that resembled her caused Igole to change his ways, and soon he was freed from Nox's control and now lives with her. She also calls him Crazy-Eyes. In the prequel, he was drawn as a dog. This is because Igole is a Bow Wow by species, a type of dog analog in the Wakfu universe.\n\n;Qilby\n:''Voiced by'': Erik Colin <small>''(Season 2)''</small>, Laurent Morteau <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (French); [[Arthur Bostrom]] <small>''(Season 2)''</small>, [[Joe Ochman]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n: Qilby is the main antagonist of season two and the central villain of the series overall. He was accidentally summoned from the blank dimension when Yugo tried to harness the power of the Eliacube, when he comes to the world of Twelve he explains the origins of his species (through half-truths) and sends Yugo on a quest to acquire the Dofus (dragon egg) of his sister dragon, Shinonome. His true plan is eventually revealed \u2013 that the quest was large to distract Yugo so he could regain his power, steal back the Eliacube and then absorb the Wakfu of the planet to power his ship so he can continue to explore the Krozmos (the process would destroy the planet). He is finally defeated by Yugo, Elatrops children, and Shinonome (who refuses to help brother's foolish. Yugo sends him back in the blank dimension. While originally quiet, friendly and softspoken his personality changes drastically when he fuses with the Eliacube becoming cruel, sadistic, maniacal and manipulative.\n\n:It is unknown whether this is a result of the Eliacube warping his personality or if it is his true colors. The true source of his madness was his gift/curse: his eternal memory. No matter how many times he's reborn, he always remembers. This leads him to begin driven mad by boredom since there was nothing left to learn. Also, another source of his madness was his fear of being alone, which led to his actions that started the Mechanism war, forcing the Eliatropes to abandon their old homeworld.\n\n:He has all the same Powers as Yugo though many of them are more advanced versions, as well as an assortment of other Wakfu abilities, he also has full knowledge of the Eliacube and its workings (Nox spent 200 years just trying to figure out how to work it) makes him even more dangerous than Nox, he is also able to remember his past lives which are unique to his species and implied to be the source of his knowledge and madness, which he later stated was a curse. He is unquestionably the most powerful and dangerous villain in the series so far, with the possible exception of Rushu and Oropo. He and Season 1 villain Nox return as phantoms to torture Yugo.\n\n====ShuShus'====\n;Rushu\n:''Voiced by'': [[Marc Alfos]] (French); [[Jimmy Hibbert]] (English)\n:The tyrannical king of all Shushus. A 10-meter tall fiery demon, he is from another world, one that has mostly been destroyed down to rock and ash. He is looking for a way to enter the World of Twelve, so full of light and life, that he and his demons can keep destroying things. His powers are said to be equal to that of a god and include, super strength, pyrokinesis, telekinesis, and others as well. In the season 2 finale, his true form was revealed to be a grayish-black humanoid with a single eye (it was said his fiery form is just for show). During the battle of Crimson Claws archipelago, he was sent back to the ShuShu realm.\n\n;Anathar\n:''Voiced by'': Antoine Tome (French); Joe Mills <small>''(Most Appearances)''</small>, Keir Stewart <small>''(Episode 34)''</small> (English)\n:A Shushu with the power to copy the ability of anyone he touches. Originally a bound shushu, he was released by his guardian and refused to be unsummoned. After being freed by the Brotherhood of Tofu, Remington releases him to distract the heroes; he quickly realizes this is a bad idea. Yugo uses his portal magic to attack Anathar, which he is then able to use much more powerfully than Yugo, such as generating a hundred portals at once. He is so powerful, he even opened up a portal into the Shushu realm. Through his actions, it would seem this power has a time limit for how long he can use it. He participates in the final battle in possing Adama\u00ef against Yugo, but he is betrayed and threatened of destruction by Qilby, he decides to leave him to take care of Adamai and Yugo, Qilby accepts and spares Anathar. His final fate is unknown, he is presumed killed by Qilby when he tried to kill him for having insulted but it is possible that he is escaped and hid somewhere. Anathar and Ombrage are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.\n\n;Ombrage ('''Shadowfang''' in the English dub)\n:''Voiced by'': Malvina Germain (French); Fiona Clarke (English)\n:A Shushu imprisoned in a ring, she has the power to steal a person's shadow, which appears to represent the target's soul, and turns them into a ghoul. However, she is unable to do this if the target lacks any darkness in their heart. She is first met in a ruined town, where she has taken over her guardian's spirit, who goes by the name Vampyro. After being defeated, her guardian swears never to fall for her tricks again. She returns in season 2 as an ally of Rubilax. Once Percedal is returned to his body, though, she is left behind, ignored by her guardian. In the closing scenes, however, an unknown figure picks her up. Ombrage and Anathar are the only Shushus who did not return to ShuShu realm.\n\n====The Brotherhood of the Forgotten/The Siblings====\nThe main antagonists of season 3. A secret Guild where all the members are demigods or children of Dragons, thus they are semi-immortal. Their stated goal is to replace their parents and become the new gods of the World of Twelve, believing that the gods don't care about them and that the world has become horribly corrupt under their rule. They threw down the gauntlet against the Brotherhood of Tofu in Season 3 because their leader, Oropo, desires both the Percedal family children and Ruel to join their new pantheon. Furthermore, he has an unspecified need for Yugo's help as well in his plan. To that end, he is using the weaknesses and doubts in the characters to try to bring them to his side. However, later episodes reveal that not everyone in The Siblings fully trusts their leader and some begin to move on their own.\n\n;Oropo\n:''Voiced by'': Franck Lorrain (French); [[Christopher Corey Smith]] (English)\n:The mysterious leader who appears in a large cloak with an owl-like mask. Oropo believed that the current gods are lazy and selfish, and wants them to be replaced by The Siblings. Oropo is very calm and persuasive individual, able to win others to his side with these traits. He claims to hate violence and chaos, and is lenient on others despite what he considers flaws in their personalities. He also follows the principles of the end justifying the means, and that sacrifice is necessary for change. He refers to himself as a non-existence.\n\n:At the end of season 3 where he is revealed to be the last of the Eliotropes, a shadow-clone race accidentally created by Yugo in his image before he fought Ogrest. Once his identity is revealed, he shows a dark version side of himself. He identifies the same traits in Yugo and longs to replace him and be the \"real\" Yugo. Despite wanting to save the world, his ultimate plan still involves destroying all life on the planet, to eliminate the prayers going to the gods, making them vanish. He had no qualms about lying, using, or manipulating others and excused his actions or hypocritically shifted blame onto someone else. His actions, his reasons, and his extremes make Oropo no better than the gods he wishes to destroy.\n\n:Deep down, Oropo knows his actions and reasons for doing them are wrong and selfish, and he truly loved the Siblings, considering them his family, and he had been in love with Echo. His greatest flaw had been his obsession with becoming the \"real Yugo\", to take Yugo's place, and joining the Brotherhood of the Tofu, whom he saw as family because of the feelings and memories he'd inherited from Yugo that blinded him to the love and devotion of Echo and his friends until it was too late.\n\n:Oropo is extremely powerful, able to bend time and space in the creation of his multi-dimensional tower of dreams. Furthermore, he has somehow gained possession of the Eliacube which can make its user as strong as a god. He is also able to enter people's minds through the cracks of their doubts and fears. When his people, the Eliotrope, dies, their Wakfu would transfer into Oropo, making him hold all the Wakfu of his once dead race.\n\n;Dame Echo\n:''Voiced by'': [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bizot]] (French); Julie-Ann Dean <small>''(OVAs)''</small>, [[Cherami Leigh]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:The second in command of The Siblings, meant to replace her mother Eniripsa. Echo is the face of the guild whenever Oropo isn't around. It was revealed that she is in a relationship with Oropo and joined his cause for aligning to his beliefs and simultaneously being in love with him.\n\n;Adamai\n:''Voiced by'': Jeremy Prevost (French); [[Todd Haberkorn]] (English)\n:Once a member of the Brotherhood of the Tofu, but soon joins The Siblings after a falling out between him and Yugo over using the Eliatrope Dofus. Adamai gained a taller body and even more powerful abilities after draining the Eliatrope Dofus, becoming even darker and villainous, willing to kill his former friends.\n\n;Sipho\n:''Voiced by'': Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Vl\u00e9rick (French); Taylor Clarke-Hill <small>''(OVA)''</small>, [[Keith Silverstein]] <small>''(Season 3)''</small> (English)\n:Child of a dragon, used as a spy.\n\n;Count Harebourg\n:''Voiced by'': Sylvain Aga\u00ebsse (French); [[Jimmy Hibbert]] (English)\n:A Xelor demigod who is a master of time and ice magic.

Despite his size, he is very fast and agile. After attacking Percedal and Eva and their family, Adamai tasks him with finding the escaped Elely.

While he refuses to talk, Yugo confiscates his recall potions which the Brotherhood of the Tofu uses to go after the kidnappers. Meant to replace his mother, Pandawa.\n\n;Toxine\n:''Voiced by'': Caroline Combes (French); [[Reba Buhr]] (English)\n:A female Sram assassin, who can turn invisible and has glowing green markings on her otherwise featureless black body.

Wagnar wore the ring that Ombrage was trapped in and her demonic powers transformed the guardian into \"Vampyro\", causing him to steal the souls of the townspeople to form an army of ghouls. When Yugo's team visits Katrepat town, Vampyro ambushes them with this army of ghouls and kidnaps Evangelyne in order to give Ombrage a body to inhabit. When transformed into Vampyro, he has an unfortunate allergy to Tofus, which eventually becomes his undoing. Afterward, he realized she was merely using him and swore to never fall for her trickery again.\n\n:Ombrage returns in Season 2, now wielded by Rubilax in Percedal's body.\n\n;Sybannak\n:''Voiced by'': Dolly Vanden (French); Fiona Clarke (English)\n\n;Breadnought\n:''Voiced by'': Elisabeth Fargeot (French); [[Jules de Jongh]] (English)\n:A mysterious old [[Dofus#Characters classes|Enutrof]] who seeks to ruin Xav the Baker's chances at winning the Chtibrout Baker's Tournament by destroying his golden wheat storage.

He is extremely sly and cunning, always trying to gain the upper hand through deceptive means and likes to play dirty. His deceptiveness sometimes becomes his own undoing; during a fight with Evangelyne over the possession of Percedal -- who was trapped in Rubilax's sword body -- he falls off the edge of a building, hanging upside down at the end of a rope. He promises Eva that he won't trick her if she saves him, however, when he gets to the ledge, he tries to kill her with a sword Shushu.
