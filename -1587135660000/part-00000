The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], G\u00f3mez argues the change is not statistically significant. These results are consistent with a CDC report<ref name=cdc160624>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0624-water-lead.html|title=CDC Press Releases|date=January 1, 2016|website=CDC}}</ref> which found that the fraction of \"all children under age 6\" with elevated lead blood level \"was nearly 50 percent higher after the switch to Flint River water.\" The striking result of G\u00f3mez et al. however is that during the 11-year period, the \"crisis years\" are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels. That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably due to the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.\n\n==== Virginia Tech water study ====\n[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the<br /> first Virginia Tech Flint water study.]] \nIn September 2015 a team from [[Virginia Tech]] arrived in Flint.

In April 2015, the county health department contacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was \"very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.\" However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.<ref name=\"FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning\">{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html|title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/officials_were_warned_of_flint.html|title=Officials were warned of Flint water, Legionnaires' link months before public|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/governor_wants_investigation_i.html|title=Governor wants investigation into MDHHS in handling of Legionnaires' outbreak|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2017, it was reported the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. \"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread,\" said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. \"The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.\" Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates\u2014or bacteria\u2014matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there \"suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.\"<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html CDC finds first genetic link between Legionnaires' outbreak, Flint water] ''The flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 16, 2017</ref><ref>[http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak], ''Michigan Radio'', February 16, 2017</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.

''The New York Times'' notes, \"Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.\" Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and \"efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.\" The crisis called attention to a \"resource gap\" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that \"federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,\" with \"serious implications for states' ability to protect public health.\"<ref name=\"WinesSchwartz\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil.

Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them.

Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 grams. Beginning with January 2014 conception dates, the Flint, Michigan population saw the incidence of low birth weight infants increase from 13.3% to 15.7%.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/> Further analysis, using other counties as controls with similar demographics during the same time period, were then assessed in order to prove these lower birth weights did not happen by chance. Overall, birth weight in Flint was found to be 48.9 grams less than the control group with a statistically significant 1.53% increase in incidences of low birth weight.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/> The study also analyzed the effects of race in regards to changes in birth weights. White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties. Also, the birth weights after the climax of the crisis were not assessed to see if they bounced back to pre-crisis weights. Increased lead consumption and stress were hypothesized to be reasons behind the increase in low birth weights, but there were likely many additional confounding factors.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/>\n\n====Wayne State University, Department of Communication Study====\nIn a study published in the Journal of Communication Studies, researchers conducted a survey on the crisis communications methods used during the Flint water contamination by looking at media use between different racial groups.

The study found that the water lead level breakeven points for reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation were 7.31 \u00b5g/L, 3.73 \u00b5g/L, and 12.0 \u00b5g/L, respectively.<ref name=\"POU device\"/> The cost-benefit was analyzed as a 70-year (lifetime) duration, which is much longer than the Flint water crisis, but these POU devices could still serve to be a valuable tool in preventing the consumption of water-soluble lead in the future.\n\nUsing predictive models could be another invaluable way to help prevent another crisis like the one in Flint. Many municipalities across the country have outdated or incomplete records on their water service line materials, and governments have finite resources to identify and fix the problem of lead lines. In Flint, it is clear that a data-driven approach allowed public money to be spent more efficiently in ways that directly align with public health protection. Because the public (utility-owned) portion of service lines is buried under roads and sidewalks, it is expensive to verify pipe materials. Depending on the verification method, it can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars per home. Flint spent more than $20 million on unnecessary excavations when it ignored model predictions in 2018, instead of targeting homes with the highest likelihood of having a lead service line.<ref>Webb, Jared et al. \u201c[https://storage.googleapis.com/flint-storage-bucket/d4gx_2019%20(2).pdf Getting the Lead Out: Data Science and Water Service Lines in Flint].\u201d Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange.

Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns.

However, the water from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, where Flint had obtained its water since 1967, had been [[water treatment|treated]] well enough that the leaching from the lead pipes was at levels considered acceptable by state and federal environmental protection agencies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf|title=The City of Flint Police Department Crime Reduction Strategy|last1=Snyder|first1=Richard D.|last2=Calley|first2=Brian|author-link1=Rick Snyder|author-link2=Brian Calley|date=January 20, 2016|publisher=Flint Water Study|access-date=August 14, 2016}}</ref> There are an estimated 43,000 service lines in the city; these include 3,500 lead lines, 9,000 known galvanized lines, and 9,000 unknown service lines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/05/city_ready_to_accept_proposals.html|title=City officials set to accept proposals to replace lead lines in Flint|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=May 31, 2016|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLead exposure across the U.S. has fallen dramatically since the 1980s, but no blood-lead level is considered completely safe.

Acidic water makes it easier for the lead found in pipes, leaded solder, and brass faucets to dissolve and to enter a home's drinking water. Therefore, public water treatment systems are legally required to use control measures to make water less acidic. Plumbing that contains lead is often found in buildings constructed in the 1980s and earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp13.pdf|date=August 2007|agency=Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry|title=ATSDR Toxicological Profile for Lead|accessdate=April 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Financial emergency===\n{{See also|Flint, Michigan#Second financial emergency: 2011\u2013present}}\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Governor Snyder appointed four emergency managers to control Flint's finances.<ref name=BosmanDaveySmith>{{cite news|last1=Bosman|first1=Bosman|last2=Davey|first2=Monica|last3=Smith|first3=Mitch|title=As Water Problems Grew, Officials Belittled Complaints From Flint|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/us/flint-michigan-lead-water-crisis.html|accessdate=March 24, 2016|work=New York Times|date=January 20, 2016}}</ref> After 2015, the city continued to receive financial guidance under the lesser oversight of a [[Government of Flint, Michigan#Receivership Transition Advisory Board|Receivership Transition Advisory Board]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fonger|first1=Ron|title='A heavy burden' lifted from Flint as Gov.

Hanna-Attisha's sample numbers were large, both for the pre-switch and post-switch time periods and for Flint children (1,473) and for children not exposed to Flint water (2,202). Demographics were meaningfully different among the two groups. In terms of race, 24.4% of the children outside of Flint were African American, while 76.8% of the children in areas of high water lead levels (\u2265 15 parts per billion) were African American, and 67.0% of the children in areas of lower water lead levels (< 15 parts per billion) were African American.

The original 2015 study of Hurley records involved a total of 1,473 children \"younger than 5 years\" whose address could be mapped to a site inside Flint in two pre/post 8.5 month periods. The 2018 study, led by Hern\u00e1n F. G\u00f3mez, involved 15,817 children \"aged \u22645 years\" over the 11-year period 2006\u20132016. Data for 2012\u20132016 were available from center's Epic EMR system; records for earlier years were scrounged from legacy systems. The results show an increase in the fraction of children with elevated lead blood levels immediately pre/post the water switch (from 2.2% to 3.7%); invoking a [[Bonferroni correction]], G\u00f3mez argues the change is not statistically significant. These results are consistent with a CDC report<ref name=cdc160624>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0624-water-lead.html|title=CDC Press Releases|date=January 1, 2016|website=CDC}}</ref> which found that the fraction of \"all children under age 6\" with elevated lead blood level \"was nearly 50 percent higher after the switch to Flint River water.\" The striking result of G\u00f3mez et al. however is that during the 11-year period, the \"crisis years\" are actually the third and fourth lowest years for lead blood levels. That is, the upward blip during the water switch sits on a rapid declining curve (presumably due to the many lead mitigation projects that have been initiated nationally) so that blood lead levels during the crisis are actually lower than those two years earlier.\n\n==== Virginia Tech water study ====\n[[File:Marc Edwards 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marc Edwards (civil engineering professor)|Marc Edwards]] led the<br /> first Virginia Tech Flint water study.]] \nIn September 2015 a team from [[Virginia Tech]] arrived in Flint.

In April 2015, the county health department contacted the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), and in April 2015 a CDC employee wrote in an email that the Legionnaires' outbreak was \"very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.\" However, MDHHS told the county health department at the time that federal assistance was not necessary.<ref name=\"FongerLegionnaireEarlyWarning\">{{cite news|first=Ron|last=Fonger|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html|title=Public never told, but investigators suspected Flint River tie to Legionnaires' in 2014|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=January 16, 2016|accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmails obtained by Progress Michigan in February 2016 indicate Snyder's office knew about the outbreak since March 2015, despite Snyder's claim he was only informed in January 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/us-world/index.ssf/2016/02/officials_were_warned_of_flint.html|title=Officials were warned of Flint water, Legionnaires' link months before public|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Michigan Live|date=February 4, 2016|accessdate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2016, Governor Snyder ordered an investigation of the MDHHS regarding the outbreak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/03/governor_wants_investigation_i.html|title=Governor wants investigation into MDHHS in handling of Legionnaires' outbreak|newspaper=The Flint Journal|agency=Michigan Live|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn February 16, 2017, it was reported the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] discovered the first genetic links between city water and patients diagnosed with Legionnaires' disease in Genesee County. \"The presence of Legionella in Flint was widespread,\" said Janet Stout, a research associate professor at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and a national expert on the disease. \"The (laboratory) results show that strains (of the bacteria) were throughout the water system.\" Virginia Tech researcher Amy Pruden published a study that found Legionella levels up to 1,000 times higher than normal tap water in Flint, and said finding a patient whose clinical isolates\u2014or bacteria\u2014matched the McLaren water sample without having been hospitalized there \"suggests that same strain may have been elsewhere.\"<ref>[http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2017/02/cdc_finds_first_genetic_link_b.html CDC finds first genetic link between Legionnaires' outbreak, Flint water] ''The flint Journal'' via MLive.com, February 16, 2017</ref><ref>[http://michiganradio.org/post/new-tests-raise-questions-about-source-legionnaires-disease-outbreak New tests raise questions about the source of Legionnaires Disease outbreak], ''Michigan Radio'', February 16, 2017</ref>\n\nOn March 10, 2017, affidavits filed by experts in court supported the conclusion that Flint water was connected to the Legionnaires' disease outbreak.

''The New York Times'' notes, \"Although Congress banned lead water pipes 30 years ago, between 3.3 million and 10 million older ones remain, primed to leach lead into tap water by forces as simple as jostling during repairs or a change in water chemistry.\" Inadequate regulation was cited as one reason for unsafe lead levels in tap water and \"efforts to address shortcomings often encounter push-back from industries like agriculture and mining that fear cost increases, and from politicians ideologically opposed to regulation.\" The crisis called attention to a \"resource gap\" for water regulators. The annual budget of the EPA's drinking water office declined 15% from 2006 to 2015, with the office losing over 10% of employees, and the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators reported in 2013 that \"federal officials had slashed drinking-water grants, 17 states had cut drinking-water budgets by more than a fifth, and 27 had cut spending on full-time employees,\" with \"serious implications for states' ability to protect public health.\"<ref name=\"WinesSchwartz\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the water crisis, it was noted that elevated blood-lead levels in children are found in many cities across Michigan, including Detroit, [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], and [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. Although statewide childhood lead-poisoning rates have dramatically declined since the [[Tetraethyllead|removal of lead from gasoline]], certain areas of the state (particularly low-income areas with older housing stock) continue to experience lead poisoning, mostly from lead paint in homes built before 1978 and lead residue in dust and soil.

Rather, the response is the result of implicit bias and the history of systemic racism that was built into the foundation of Flint. The lessons of Flint are profound. While the exact situation and response that happened in Flint may never happen anywhere else, the factors that led to this crisis remain in place and will most certainly lead to other tragedies if we don't take steps to remedy them.

Low birth weight was defined as a birth weight less than 2,500 grams. Beginning with January 2014 conception dates, the Flint, Michigan population saw the incidence of low birth weight infants increase from 13.3% to 15.7%.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/> Further analysis, using other counties as controls with similar demographics during the same time period, were then assessed in order to prove these lower birth weights did not happen by chance. Overall, birth weight in Flint was found to be 48.9 grams less than the control group with a statistically significant 1.53% increase in incidences of low birth weight.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/> The study also analyzed the effects of race in regards to changes in birth weights. White mothers saw a 71-gram reduction in birth weight, resulting in a 2.73% increase in low birth weight infants. There were not any statistically meaningful differences among African American infants. There were likely not enough control counties to properly assess African American birth weights separately. The main limitation of the study was that infants of Flint were compared to infants of other counties. Also, the birth weights after the climax of the crisis were not assessed to see if they bounced back to pre-crisis weights. Increased lead consumption and stress were hypothesized to be reasons behind the increase in low birth weights, but there were likely many additional confounding factors.<ref name=\"wisconsin-milwaukee\"/>\n\n====Wayne State University, Department of Communication Study====\nIn a study published in the Journal of Communication Studies, researchers conducted a survey on the crisis communications methods used during the Flint water contamination by looking at media use between different racial groups.

The study found that the water lead level breakeven points for reverse osmosis, activated carbon, and distillation were 7.31 \u00b5g/L, 3.73 \u00b5g/L, and 12.0 \u00b5g/L, respectively.<ref name=\"POU device\"/> The cost-benefit was analyzed as a 70-year (lifetime) duration, which is much longer than the Flint water crisis, but these POU devices could still serve to be a valuable tool in preventing the consumption of water-soluble lead in the future.\n\nUsing predictive models could be another invaluable way to help prevent another crisis like the one in Flint. Many municipalities across the country have outdated or incomplete records on their water service line materials, and governments have finite resources to identify and fix the problem of lead lines. In Flint, it is clear that a data-driven approach allowed public money to be spent more efficiently in ways that directly align with public health protection. Because the public (utility-owned) portion of service lines is buried under roads and sidewalks, it is expensive to verify pipe materials. Depending on the verification method, it can range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars per home. Flint spent more than $20 million on unnecessary excavations when it ignored model predictions in 2018, instead of targeting homes with the highest likelihood of having a lead service line.<ref>Webb, Jared et al. \u201c[https://storage.googleapis.com/flint-storage-bucket/d4gx_2019%20(2).pdf Getting the Lead Out: Data Science and Water Service Lines in Flint].\u201d Bloomberg Data for Good Exchange.

Some adults felt guilty about giving children contaminated water, and in some cases family members stopped visiting. Some residents related the water crisis to depression and even thoughts of suicide; some sought treatment for mental breakdowns.

{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print. Company|pages=244\u2013}}</ref> The [[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V|Nawab of Bahawalpur]], according to a Pakistani journalist, kept 390 concubines. He only had sex with most of them once.{{sfn|Weiss|2004|p=190}} [[Maratha (caste)|Marathas]] captured during their wars with the Mughals had been given to the soldiers of the Mughal Army from the Baloch [[Bugti]] tribe. The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved.

Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters.

The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families.

Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Attitude==\nThe vast majority of Muslims today oppose sexual slavery. This is demonstrated, amongst other things, by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} A few writers claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} Modern academics, such as [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law recognises two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}\n*Slave-girls by descent: those who are born to slave parents.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n*Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p-18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\nUmm walad (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of umm walad even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the data found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} Due to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an umm walad. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p-531}} Elite men were required to leave their wives and concubines if they wished to marry an Ottoman princess. Writing in the early 18th century, one visitor noted that from among the Ottoman courtiers, only the imperial treasurer kept female slaves for sex and he was perceived as lustful by others.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=199}} [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]], who visited Egypt in the 1830s, noted that very few Egyptian men were polygamous and most of the men with only one wife did not keep concubines, usually for the sake of domestic peace. However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread. Except for the Sultans, there is no evidence that the [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] nobility or merchants kept slaves.{{sfn|Hasan|2005|p=244}} In medieval [[Punjab]] the Muslim peasants, artisans, small tradesmen, shopkeepers, clerks and minor officials could not afford concubines or slaves.{{sfn|Gandhi|2007|p=19}} But the Muslim nobility of medieval Punjab, such as the [[Khan]]s and Maliks, kept concubines and slaves.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=11}} Female slaves were used for concubinage in many wealthy Muslim households of Punjab.{{sfn|Grewal|1998|p=12}}\n\nColonial court cases from 19th century Punjab show that the courts recognised the legitimate status of children born to Muslim [[zamindar]]s (landlords) from their concubines.<ref>{{cite book|author=Punjab (India)|title=The Punjab Civil Code (part I) and Selected Acts, with a Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PZVeAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA244|year=1869|publisher=Punjab Print. Company|pages=244\u2013}}</ref> The [[Sadeq Mohammad Khan V|Nawab of Bahawalpur]], according to a Pakistani journalist, kept 390 concubines. He only had sex with most of them once.{{sfn|Weiss|2004|p=190}} [[Maratha (caste)|Marathas]] captured during their wars with the Mughals had been given to the soldiers of the Mughal Army from the Baloch [[Bugti]] tribe. The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation. Rajputs practised jauhar mainly when their opponents were Muslims.{{sfn|Naravane|1999|p=45}}\n\nThe womenfolk of enemies were captured both to humiliate their men and to use the beautiful maidens for various purposes.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=57}} Beautiful female captives were mostly used for sex.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} After the period of Akbar's rule enslavement of women continued to be used to punish their men. [[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem. [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king. The rest would either be sold or kept for themselves.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali']]<nowiki/>s army captured Maratha women to fill Afghan harems.{{sfn|Singh|2006|p=68}} The Sikhs attacked Abdali and rescued 2, 2000 Maratha girls.{{sfn|Singh|2015|p=78}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by non-Muslim men===\nMuslim historical sources see the capture and concubinage of non-Muslim women as legitimate violence against women. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved.

Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them.

The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters.

Schanberg]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Nayanika Mookherjee|title=The Spectral Wound: Sexual Violence, Public Memories, and the Bangladesh War of 1971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtrDCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT159|date=23 October 2015|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-7522-7|pages=159\u2013}}</ref>\n\nThe evidence strongly demonstrates that the government of Sudan had revived slavery and made it as important as it was in the previous century.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=29}} The [[Sudanese army]] had a central role in the revival of slavery.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=32}} The slavery in Sudan was a result of the conflict between [[North Sudan]]'s Arab Muslims and [[South Sudan]]'s black Christians.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} Christian prisoners of war in the [[Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)|Sudanese civil war]] were often enslaved. The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]] the [[Taliban]] has committed atrocities against the Shia population. One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The Taliban either takes beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly marries them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}}\n\n==Modern Attitude==\nThe vast majority of Muslims today oppose sexual slavery. This is demonstrated, amongst other things, by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} A few writers claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} Modern academics, such as [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}}\n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

The date 1257 on its logo refers to the founding of [[Coll\u00e8ge de Sorbonne]] by [[Robert de Sorbon]], part of the university's early legacy.

Consequently, Sorbonne University won an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of 900 Mio euros with no limit of time. This is the first higher education institution in Paris region to win such an [[Financial endowment|endowment]]. The university was established by a 21 April 2017 decree,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte= JORFTEXT000034455357&dateTexte= &categorieLien=id |title=D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2017-596 du 21 avril 2017 portant cr\u00e9ation de l'universit\u00e9 Sorbonne-Universit\u00e9 |work=[[Journal officiel de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise]] |date=23 April 2017 }}</ref> taking place on 1 January 2018.\n\n== Faculties ==\nSorbonne University has 3 faculties; additionally, Law is taught by [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]].\n\n=== Humanities (Lettres) ===\nLetters are the more ancient teachings of the humanity faculty. [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Languages]], [[Musicology]], [[Philosophy]] are part of this faculty.\n\n=== Science ===\nThe Faculty of Science of Sorbonne University is a major research institution in France.  It can be considered the successor in direct line to the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris.\n\nIt has more than 125 laboratories, most of them in association with the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS). Some of its most notable institutes and laboratories include the [[Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (Mathematics), [[Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]] (Astrophysics), [[Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6|LIP6]] (Informatics / Computer Science), [http://www.isir.upmc.fr/index.php Institut des syst\u00e8mes intelligents et de robotique] (Robotics), Institut de math\u00e9matiques de Jussieu (foundations of Mathematics, shared with [[Paris Diderot University|University Paris-Diderot]]) and the [[Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel]] (Quantum Physics, shared with [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]).\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe faculty of Medicine is located in two [[teaching hospital]]s, [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital]] and '''H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine''' (the latter itself being the successor to [[Saint-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey]]).\n\n== Law (external teachings) ==\nThere is no Law school as such in Sorbonne University. In 1971, most of the law professors from the [[Paris Law Faculty|Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris]] decided to restructure it as a university, called [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]] (after the two main campuses of the Paris Law Faculty: ''place du Panth\u00e9on'' and ''rue d\u2019Assas'' campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cne-evaluation.fr/WCNE_pdf/Paris2.pdf|title=French National Agency of Evaluation of Higher education institutions, p.65}}</ref>Panth\u00e9on-Assas now provides Law teachings for Sorbonne University as an independent university.\n\n== Campuses ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Paris-Sorbonne.jpg|The Sorbonne\nFile:Paris 75005 Grande Galerie de l'Evolution 20070804.jpg|Perspective view from the [[Jardin des Plantes]]\n\nImage:Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre_Sorbone.JPG|The \"Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre Richelieu\", a [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]'s lecture hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sorbonne ===\n{{See|Sorbonne}}\n'''Sorbonne University''''s historical campus is in the historic central '''Sorbonne''' building, located at 47 rue des \u00c9coles, in the Latin Quarter.

The chapel was built in 1622 by the then-Provisor of the University of Paris, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], during the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. In 1881, politician [[Jules Ferry]] decided to convert the Sorbonne into one single building. Under the supervision of Pierre Greard, Chief Officer of the Education Authority of Paris, Henri-Paul N\u00e9not constructed the current building from 1883 to 1901 that reflects a basic architectural uniformity. The integration of the chapel into the whole was also N\u00e9not's work with the construction of a [[cour d'honneur]]. The Sorbonne building is generally reserved for undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students in certain academic disciplines. Only students in Semitic studies, regardless of level, take all their classes at the Sorbonne campus.\n\nThe Library of the Sorbonne is an inter-university library of the Universities Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne (Paris 1), New Sorbonne (Paris 3), Sorbonne University, Paris Descartes (Paris 5), and Paris Diderot (Paris 7), under the administration of Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr/ biu/spip.php?rubrique294 |title=Convention de la BIS |website=bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr |language=fr}}</ref> It is open exclusively to undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students.

It houses the Faculty of Science. The first buildings are from 1957. The main part of the campus, the \"Gril d'Albert,\" was built in 1964, and was completely refurbished from 1996 to 2016.<ref>[http://focuscampus.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/09/29/le-campus-renove-de-lupmc-ou-lautre-visage-de-luniversite/]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Maison de la Recherche ===\n[[Image:Salle Saint-Jacques (Biblioth\u00e8que de la Sorbonne).jpg|thumb|right|250|Inter-university Library of La Sorbonne]]\nThe Maison de la Recherche campus is the central building for doctoral studies that hosts the history and geography departments. It houses the Serpente Library that has 55,000 works and 292 past and current French and international periodicals. All doctoral dissertations since 1 January 1986 have been stored at the Serpente Library.\n\n=== Clignancourt and Malesherbes ===\nTwo other campuses are the Clignancourt and Malesherbes centers. Undergraduate students in their first and second years of study in Philosophy, History, [[Geography]], English and Spanish take their classes at the Clignancourt center. The Clignancourt Library contains 78,000 works, 210 French and international periodicals and 800 educational DVDs.\n\nUndergraduate students in their first and second years of study in [[French literature]], French language, [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Musicology]] take their classes at the Malesherbes center. All undergraduate students in these academic disciplines study in the central Sorbonne building in their third year. Undergraduate and graduate students in [[German studies]], [[Slavic studies]], [[Italian language|Italic studies]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian studies]], regardless of level, take all of their classes at the Malesherbes center. The Malesherbes center also hosts three research centers in [[Italian culture]], the cultures and literature of central Europe and the Balkans and the Germanic, Nordic and Dutch centers. The Malesherbes Library contains 200,000 works specializing in the study of foreign languages and cultures and 1,200 past and current French and international periodicals. More than 50,000 doctoral dissertations are available for public viewing.\n\n=== Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie ===\nUndergraduate [[Art History]] and [[Archeology]] students take their classes at the Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, located at the main entrance of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. Constructed by architect Paul Bigot between 1925 and 1930, the Mesopotamian-style building was classified as a national historical building in 1996. It hosts the Michelet Library that contains 100,000 volumes of work on art history and archeology with 100 French and international periodicals. Only 10,000 of the art history and archeology works are open to students, the others requiring special authorization of usage. Graduate Art History and Archeology students take their courses at the Institut National de l'Histoire de l'Art in the Galerie Colbert, a partnered national institution of the University.\n\n=== Other campuses in Paris ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}\nBoth the Institut d'Urbanisme et d'Am\u00e9nagement and the Institut d'Etudes hispanique in the Latin Quarter host third year and graduate students of [[Geography]] and Iberian and Latin American studies. The Marcel Bataillon Library houses the Institut d'Etudes hispaniques' collection of 25,000 works on Iberian and Latin-American culture. Catalan studies take place at the Centre d'Etudes catalanes in the Marais.\n\nThere are also Campus Piti\u00e9 and Campus Saint-Antoine for medicine ; Campus Les Cordeliers, Campus Curie and Campus Raspail for sciences.\n\n=== Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi ===\n{{main|Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi}}\nAn exclusive international agreement between Paris-Sorbonne and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] was signed on 19 February 2006, starting plans to bring Paris-Sorbonne University to Abu Dhabi. The Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (PSUAD) was established on 30 May 2008 on Reem Island by a decree of the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. All programs are taught in the French language except for the Bachelor of Physics which is taught in English and the Masters programs. An intensive French language programme is offered for one or two year(s) to students who do not meet the French language requirement for registration. The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education, having also signed a contract with the [[Louvre]] in 2007 to create the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], and with [[New York University]] in 2007 to create [[New York University Abu Dhabi]]. PSUAD is jointly governed by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and by PSUAD's board of six members, three of whom are appointed by the home Paris-Sorbonne University, the other three appointed by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. The President of PSUAD and Chairman of the Board is the President of the home Paris-Sorbonne University, currently Georges Molini\u00e9. Academic programs are offered at the undergraduate level only in the social sciences, humanities and fine arts.\n\n==Academic==\nMembers have worked on several projects in order to strengthen the relations between them and potentially create a new international institution. The most famous projects are the \"Sorbonne College\" (Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne) for bachelor's degree teaching and the \"Sorbonne Doctoral College\" (Coll\u00e8ge doctoral de la Sorbonne) for PhD candidates.\n\n===The Sorbonne College===\nSince 2014, the Sorbonne College for bachelor's degree (\u00ab Coll\u00e8ge des Licences de la Sorbonne \u00bb) has been coordinating the academic projects inside Sorbonne University and with Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, the law school of the Sorbonne University Group which has not merged into the Sorbonne University and remained independent. It also offers cross-institutional academic courses in many fields, allowing students to graduate from both institutions.

Some of its most notable institutes and laboratories include the [[Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (Mathematics), [[Institut d'astrophysique de Paris]] (Astrophysics), [[Laboratoire d'Informatique de Paris 6|LIP6]] (Informatics / Computer Science), [http://www.isir.upmc.fr/index.php Institut des syst\u00e8mes intelligents et de robotique] (Robotics), Institut de math\u00e9matiques de Jussieu (foundations of Mathematics, shared with [[Paris Diderot University|University Paris-Diderot]]) and the [[Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel]] (Quantum Physics, shared with [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]]).\n\n=== Medicine ===\nThe faculty of Medicine is located in two [[teaching hospital]]s, [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital]] and '''H\u00f4pital Saint-Antoine''' (the latter itself being the successor to [[Saint-Antoine-des-Champs Abbey]]).\n\n== Law (external teachings) ==\nThere is no Law school as such in Sorbonne University. In 1971, most of the law professors from the [[Paris Law Faculty|Faculty of Law and Economics of the University of Paris]] decided to restructure it as a university, called [[Panth\u00e9on-Assas University]] (after the two main campuses of the Paris Law Faculty: ''place du Panth\u00e9on'' and ''rue d\u2019Assas'' campuses).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cne-evaluation.fr/WCNE_pdf/Paris2.pdf|title=French National Agency of Evaluation of Higher education institutions, p.65}}</ref>Panth\u00e9on-Assas now provides Law teachings for Sorbonne University as an independent university.\n\n== Campuses ==\n<gallery>\nImage:Paris-Sorbonne.jpg|The Sorbonne\nFile:Paris 75005 Grande Galerie de l'Evolution 20070804.jpg|Perspective view from the [[Jardin des Plantes]]\n\nImage:Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre_Sorbone.JPG|The \"Amphith\u00e9\u00e2tre Richelieu\", a [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]'s lecture hall\n</gallery>\n\n=== Sorbonne ===\n{{See|Sorbonne}}\n'''Sorbonne University''''s historical campus is in the historic central '''Sorbonne''' building, located at 47 rue des \u00c9coles, in the Latin Quarter.

The chapel was built in 1622 by the then-Provisor of the University of Paris, [[Cardinal Richelieu]], during the reign of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. In 1881, politician [[Jules Ferry]] decided to convert the Sorbonne into one single building. Under the supervision of Pierre Greard, Chief Officer of the Education Authority of Paris, Henri-Paul N\u00e9not constructed the current building from 1883 to 1901 that reflects a basic architectural uniformity. The integration of the chapel into the whole was also N\u00e9not's work with the construction of a [[cour d'honneur]]. The Sorbonne building is generally reserved for undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students in certain academic disciplines. Only students in Semitic studies, regardless of level, take all their classes at the Sorbonne campus.\n\nThe Library of the Sorbonne is an inter-university library of the Universities Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne (Paris 1), New Sorbonne (Paris 3), Sorbonne University, Paris Descartes (Paris 5), and Paris Diderot (Paris 7), under the administration of Panth\u00e9on Sorbonne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr/ biu/spip.php?rubrique294 |title=Convention de la BIS |website=bibliotheque.sorbonne.fr |language=fr}}</ref> It is open exclusively to undergraduate students in their third year and graduate students.

It houses the Faculty of Science. The first buildings are from 1957. The main part of the campus, the \"Gril d'Albert,\" was built in 1964, and was completely refurbished from 1996 to 2016.<ref>[http://focuscampus.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/09/29/le-campus-renove-de-lupmc-ou-lautre-visage-de-luniversite/]{{dead link|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Maison de la Recherche ===\n[[Image:Salle Saint-Jacques (Biblioth\u00e8que de la Sorbonne).jpg|thumb|right|250|Inter-university Library of La Sorbonne]]\nThe Maison de la Recherche campus is the central building for doctoral studies that hosts the history and geography departments. It houses the Serpente Library that has 55,000 works and 292 past and current French and international periodicals. All doctoral dissertations since 1 January 1986 have been stored at the Serpente Library.\n\n=== Clignancourt and Malesherbes ===\nTwo other campuses are the Clignancourt and Malesherbes centers. Undergraduate students in their first and second years of study in Philosophy, History, [[Geography]], English and Spanish take their classes at the Clignancourt center. The Clignancourt Library contains 78,000 works, 210 French and international periodicals and 800 educational DVDs.\n\nUndergraduate students in their first and second years of study in [[French literature]], French language, [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Musicology]] take their classes at the Malesherbes center. All undergraduate students in these academic disciplines study in the central Sorbonne building in their third year. Undergraduate and graduate students in [[German studies]], [[Slavic studies]], [[Italian language|Italic studies]] and [[Romanian language|Romanian studies]], regardless of level, take all of their classes at the Malesherbes center. The Malesherbes center also hosts three research centers in [[Italian culture]], the cultures and literature of central Europe and the Balkans and the Germanic, Nordic and Dutch centers. The Malesherbes Library contains 200,000 works specializing in the study of foreign languages and cultures and 1,200 past and current French and international periodicals. More than 50,000 doctoral dissertations are available for public viewing.\n\n=== Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie ===\nUndergraduate [[Art History]] and [[Archeology]] students take their classes at the Institut d'Art et d'Arch\u00e9ologie, located at the main entrance of the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]. Constructed by architect Paul Bigot between 1925 and 1930, the Mesopotamian-style building was classified as a national historical building in 1996. It hosts the Michelet Library that contains 100,000 volumes of work on art history and archeology with 100 French and international periodicals. Only 10,000 of the art history and archeology works are open to students, the others requiring special authorization of usage. Graduate Art History and Archeology students take their courses at the Institut National de l'Histoire de l'Art in the Galerie Colbert, a partnered national institution of the University.\n\n=== Other campuses in Paris ===\n{{Expand section|date=December 2017}}\nBoth the Institut d'Urbanisme et d'Am\u00e9nagement and the Institut d'Etudes hispanique in the Latin Quarter host third year and graduate students of [[Geography]] and Iberian and Latin American studies. The Marcel Bataillon Library houses the Institut d'Etudes hispaniques' collection of 25,000 works on Iberian and Latin-American culture. Catalan studies take place at the Centre d'Etudes catalanes in the Marais.\n\nThere are also Campus Piti\u00e9 and Campus Saint-Antoine for medicine ; Campus Les Cordeliers, Campus Curie and Campus Raspail for sciences.\n\n=== Sorbonne University in Abu Dhabi ===\n{{main|Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi}}\nAn exclusive international agreement between Paris-Sorbonne and the government of [[Abu Dhabi]] was signed on 19 February 2006, starting plans to bring Paris-Sorbonne University to Abu Dhabi. The Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi (PSUAD) was established on 30 May 2008 on Reem Island by a decree of the ruler of Abu Dhabi of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. All programs are taught in the French language except for the Bachelor of Physics which is taught in English and the Masters programs. An intensive French language programme is offered for one or two year(s) to students who do not meet the French language requirement for registration. The establishment of the university demonstrates the keenness of Abu Dhabi to create an international hub in culture and education, having also signed a contract with the [[Louvre]] in 2007 to create the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]], and with [[New York University]] in 2007 to create [[New York University Abu Dhabi]]. PSUAD is jointly governed by the Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) and by PSUAD's board of six members, three of whom are appointed by the home Paris-Sorbonne University, the other three appointed by the Abu Dhabi Executive Council. The President of PSUAD and Chairman of the Board is the President of the home Paris-Sorbonne University, currently Georges Molini\u00e9. Academic programs are offered at the undergraduate level only in the social sciences, humanities and fine arts.\n\n==Academic==\nMembers have worked on several projects in order to strengthen the relations between them and potentially create a new international institution. The most famous projects are the \"Sorbonne College\" (Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne) for bachelor's degree teaching and the \"Sorbonne Doctoral College\" (Coll\u00e8ge doctoral de la Sorbonne) for PhD candidates.\n\n===The Sorbonne College===\nSince 2014, the Sorbonne College for bachelor's degree (\u00ab Coll\u00e8ge des Licences de la Sorbonne \u00bb) has been coordinating the academic projects inside Sorbonne University and with Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, the law school of the Sorbonne University Group which has not merged into the Sorbonne University and remained independent. It also offers cross-institutional academic courses in many fields, allowing students to graduate from both institutions. For example, some cross-institutional bachelor's degrees (\u00ab double licences \u00bb) are proposed to students in :\n*Science and History (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Musicology (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Philosophy (Sorbonne)\n*Science and Chinese (Sorbonne)\n*Science and German (Sorbonne)\n*Law and History (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*Law and Art History (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*Law and Science (Panth\u00e9on-Assas / Sorbonne)\n*History and Media (Sorbonne / Panth\u00e9on-Assas)<ref>{{cite web|website=\u00c9l\u00e9ad|title=Les cursus s\u00e9lectifs des grandes universit\u00e9s parisiennes, les doubles licences|url=http://elead.fr/cursus-selectifs-grandes-universites-parisiennes/|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nAs it is the case in the Anglo-American university system, Sorbonne University proposes a major-minor system, that is currently being deployed at the University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://orientation.blog.lemonde.fr/2013/05/21/la-sorbonne-universite-delite-et-de-masse-entretien-avec-barthelemy-jobert-president-de-luniversite-paris-sorbonne/|title=\" La Sorbonne, universit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9lite et de masse: entretien avec Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my Jobert, pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019universit\u00e9 Paris Sorbonne \", Le Monde.fr}}</ref>\n\nSorbonne University, in partnership with INSEAD, also offers all of its alumni and PhD students a professionalizing course in business management to complete their curriculum.\n\n===The Doctoral College===\n[[File:Docteurs-SorbonneUniversit\u00e9s-15.jpg|thumb|Sorbonne University's graduation ceremony, May 2011]]\nSince 2010, every PhD student is being delivered an honorary diploma labeled Sorbonne University. This diploma highlights and gathers the skills of the doctors and researchers from the institutions that form Sorbonne University.\n\nThe Sorbonne Doctoral College, created in 2013, coordinates the activities of the 26 doctoral schools.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |author=Pixar Post |publisher=|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground.\n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

Official trailers were released in October and December 2019.\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn January 2020, San Francisco tattoo artist Sweet Cecily Daniher filed a copyright lawsuit against Disney, Pixar, and ''Onward'' producer Kori Rae. In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |first= Scott |last= Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]].\n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixie]]s,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=21 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225005110/https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden.\n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\". The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |author=Pixar Post |publisher=|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].<ref name=\"btva\"/>\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[goblin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.
