{"title_page": "Science in the Age of Enlightenment", "text_new": "[[File:Table of Astronomy, Cyclopaedia, Volume 1, p 164.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Table of astronomy, from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]\n\nThe '''history of science during the Age of Enlightenment''' traces developments in [[science]] and [[technology]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century [[Scientific Revolution]] until roughly the 19th century, after the [[French Revolution]] (1789) and the [[Napoleonic era]] (1799\u20131815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first [[Learned society|scientific societies]], the rise of [[Heliocentrism|Copernicanism]], and the displacement of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and [[Galen|Galen\u2019s]] ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]] lost scientific credibility.\n\nWhile the Enlightenment cannot be pigeonholed into a specific doctrine or set of dogmas, science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought, and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.<ref>Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.</ref>\n\nScience during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, the French translator of Newton's Principia. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];<ref>see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.</ref> however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.\n\n==Universities==\n\n[[File:Original Yale College Building.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The original building at [[Yale]], 1718\u20131782]]\nThe number of universities in Paris remained relatively constant throughout the 18th century. Europe had about 105 universities and colleges by 1700. North America had 44, including the newly founded [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]].<ref>Porter (2003), 44.</ref> The number of university students remained roughly the same throughout the Enlightenment in most Western nations, excluding Britain, where the number of institutions and students increased.<ref>Porter (2003), 52.</ref> University students were generally males from affluent families, seeking a career in either medicine, law, or the Church. The universities themselves existed primarily to educate future [[physician]]s, [[lawyer]]s and members of the [[clergy]].<ref>Porter (2003), 45.</ref>\n\nThe study of science under the heading of [[natural philosophy]] was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[zoology]].<ref>Porter (2003), 79-80.</ref>  Most European universities taught a [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] form of [[mechanical philosophy]] in the early 18th century, and only slowly adopted Newtonianism in the mid-18th century. A notable exception were universities in [[Spain]], which under the influence of [[Catholicism]] focused almost entirely on Aristotelian natural philosophy until the mid-18th century; they were among the last universities to do so. Another exception occurred in the universities of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], where [[University of Halle]] professor [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] taught a form of Cartesianism modified by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]ian physics.<ref>Burns (2003), entry: 239.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Robert Boyle]]'s air-pump, used in the demonstration lectures of [[Pierre Polini\u00e8re]].]]\nBefore the 18th century, science courses were taught almost exclusively through formal [[lecture]]s. The structure of courses began to change in the first decades of the 18th century, when [[scientific demonstration|physical demonstrations]] were added to lectures. [[Pierre Polini\u00e8re]] and [[Jacques Rohault]] were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that [[centrifugal force]] would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an [[Vacuum pump|air-pump]].<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 195.)</ref> One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode.<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 199.</ref> Polini\u00e8re\u2019s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to [[Louis XV]] in 1722.<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 195.</ref>\n\nSome attempts at reforming the structure of the science curriculum were made during the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th century. Beginning around 1745, the [[Hats (party)|Hats party]] in Sweden made propositions to reform the university system by separating natural philosophy into two separate faculties of physics and mathematics. The propositions were never put into action, but they represent the growing calls for institutional reform in the later part of the 18th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 54.</ref> In 1777, the study of arts at [[Cracow]] and [[Vilna]] in [[Poland]] was divided into the two new faculties of [[moral philosophy]] and physics. However, the reform did not survive beyond 1795 and the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]]. During the French Revolution, all colleges and universities in France were abolished and reformed in 1808 under the single institution of the ''Universit\u00e9 imperiale''. The ''Universit\u00e9'' divided the arts and sciences into separate faculties, something that had never before been done before in Europe. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] employed the same system in 1815. However, the other countries of Europe did not adopt a similar division of the faculties until the mid-19th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 55.</ref>\n\n[[File:Entrance of Goettingen.JPG|thumb|230px|The old entrance to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]|right]]\nUniversities in France tended to serve a downplayed role in the development of science during the Enlightenment; that role was dominated by the scientific academies, such as the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. The contributions of universities in Britain were mixed. On the one hand, the [[University of Cambridge]] began teaching Newtonianism early in the Enlightenment, but failed to become a central force behind the advancement of science. On the other end of the spectrum were Scottish universities, which had strong medical faculties and became centres of scientific development.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 239\">Burns, (2003), entry: 239.</ref> Under [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], German universities began to promote the sciences. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s unique blend of Cartesian-Leibnizian physics began to be adopted in universities outside of Halle. The [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], founded in 1734, was far more liberal than its counterparts, allowing professors to plan their own courses and select their own textbooks. G\u00f6ttingen also emphasized research and publication.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 57.</ref> A further influential development in German universities was the abandonment of [[Latin]] in favour of the German [[vernacular]].<ref>Butts, (1955), p. 29.</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, the [[Netherlands]] had played a significant role in the advancement of the sciences, including [[Isaac Beeckman|Isaac Beeckman\u2019s]] mechanical philosophy and [[Christiaan Huygens]]\u2019 work on [[the calculus]] and in [[astronomy]].<ref>Jacob, (1988), pp.52-53.</ref> Professors at universities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were among the first to adopt Newtonianism. From the [[University of Leiden]], [[Willem 's Gravesande]]\u2019s students went on to spread Newtonianism to [[Harderwijk]] and [[Franeker]], among other Dutch universities, and also to the [[University of Amsterdam]].<ref>Jacob, (1988), pp. 182-187.</ref>\n\nWhile the number of universities did not dramatically increase during the Enlightenment, new private and public institutions added to the provision of education. Most of the new institutions emphasized mathematics as a discipline, making them popular with professions that required some working knowledge of mathematics, such as merchants, military and naval officers, and engineers.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 73.</ref> Universities, on the other hand, maintained their emphasis on the classics, Greek, and Latin, encouraging the popularity of the new institutions with individuals who had not been formally educated.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 239\"/>\n\n==Societies and Academies==\n\nScientific academies and societies grew out of the Scientific Revolution as the creators of scientific knowledge in contrast to the scholasticism of the university.<ref>Gillispie, (1980), p. xix.</ref> During the Enlightenment, some societies created or retained links to universities. However, contemporary sources distinguished universities from scientific societies by claiming that the university\u2019s utility was in the transmission of knowledge, while societies functioned to create knowledge.<ref>James E. McClellan III, \u201cLearned Societies,\u201d in ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'', ed. Alan Charles Kors (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&ci=9780195104301 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330082517/http://www.oup.com/us/catalog/general/subject/HistoryWorld/Modern/?view=usa&ci=9780195104301 |archivedate=2012-03-30 }} (accessed on June 8, 2008).</ref> As the role of universities in institutionalized science began to diminish, learned societies became the cornerstone of organized science. After 1700 a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies . In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term \u201cthe Age of Academies\u201d to describe the 18th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 90.</ref>\n\nNational scientific societies were founded throughout the Enlightenment era in the urban hotbeds of scientific development across Europe. In the 17th century the [[Royal Society of London]] (1662), the Paris ''[[Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences]]'' (1666), and the Berlin ''[[Akademie der Wissenschaften]]'' (1700) were founded. Around the start of the 18th century, the ''[[Academia Scientiarum Imperialis]]'' (1724) in [[St. Petersburg]], and the ''[[Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien]]'' (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) (1739) were created. Regional and provincial societies emerged from the 18th century in [[Bologna]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Dijon]], [[Lyon]]s, [[Montpellier]] and [[Uppsala]]. Following this initial period of growth, societies were founded between 1752 and 1785 in [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Dublin]], [[Edinburgh]], G\u00f6ttingen, [[Mannheim]], [[Munich]], [[Padua]] and [[Turin]]. The development of unchartered societies, such as the private the ''[[Naturforschende Gesellschaft]]'' of [[Danzig]] (1743) and [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham (1766\u20131791), occurred alongside the growth of national, regional and provincial societies.<ref>Porter, (2003), pp. 90-91.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kunstkamera (Saint-Petersburg).jpg|thumb|250px|Original headquarters of the Imperial Academy of Sciences - the [[Kunstkammer]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].|right]]\nOfficial scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 91.</ref> This advisory capacity offered scientific societies the most direct contact between the scientific community and government bodies available during the Enlightenment.<ref>Gillispie, (1980), p. xxiii.</ref> State sponsorship was beneficial to the societies as it brought finance and recognition, along with a measure of freedom in management. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society.<ref>See Gillispie, (1980), \u201cConclusion.\u201d</ref> Membership in academies and societies was therefore highly selective. In some societies, members were required to pay an annual fee to participate. For example, the Royal Society depended on contributions from its members, which excluded a wide range of artisans and mathematicians on account of the expense.<ref>Daston, (1998), p. 71</ref> Society activities included research, experimentation, sponsoring essay prize contests, and collaborative projects between societies. A dialogue of formal communication also developed between societies and society in general through the publication of [[scientific journal]]s. [[Periodicals]] offered society members the opportunity to publish, and for their ideas to be consumed by other scientific societies and the literate public. Scientific journals, readily accessible to members of learned societies, became the most important form of publication for scientists during the Enlightenment.<ref>Gillispie, (1980), p. xxi.</ref>\n\n==Periodicals==\n\n[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|210px|Cover of the first volume of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]],'' 1665-1666|left]]\nAcademies and societies served to disseminate Enlightenment science by publishing the scientific works of their members, as well as their proceedings. At the beginning of the 18th century, the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', published by the Royal Society of London, was the only scientific periodical being published on a regular, [[quarterly]] basis. The Paris Academy of Sciences, formed in 1666, began publishing in volumes of memoirs rather than a quarterly journal, with periods between volumes sometimes lasting years. While some official periodicals may have published more frequently, there was still a long delay from a paper\u2019s submission for review to its actual publication. Smaller periodicals, such as ''[[American Philosophical Society|Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]]'', were only published when enough content was available to complete a volume.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\">Burns, (2003), entry: 199.</ref> At the Paris Academy, there was an average delay of three years for publication. At one point the period extended to seven years.<ref>Porter, (2003), p.95.</ref> The Paris Academy processed submitted articles through the ''[[Comit\u00e9 de Librarie]]'', which had the final word on what would or would not be published.<ref>McClellan, (2003), pp. 11-18</ref> In 1703, the mathematician [[Antoine Parent]] began a periodical, ''Researches in Physics and Mathematics'', specifically to publish papers that had been rejected by the ''Comit\u00e9''.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/>\n\n[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|The first issue of the ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' ]]\nThe limitations of such academic journals left considerable space for the rise of independent periodicals. Some eminent examples include [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]]'s ''[[Der Naturforscher]]'' (The Natural Investigator) (1725\u20131778), ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' (1665\u20131792), the [[Jesuit]] ''[[M\u00e9moires de Tr\u00e9voux]]'' (1701\u20131779), and Leibniz\u2019s ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' (Reports/Acts of the Scholars) (1682\u20131782). Independent periodicals were published throughout the Enlightenment and excited scientific interest in the general public.<ref>Lynn, (2006), p.16</ref> While the journals of the academies primarily published scientific papers, independent periodicals were a mix of reviews, abstracts, translations of foreign texts, and sometimes derivative, reprinted materials.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/> Most of these texts were published in the local vernacular, so their continental spread depended on the language of the readers.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 195</ref> For example, in 1761 Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] correctly attributed the ring of light around [[Venus]], visible during the planet\u2019s [[Transit of Venus|transit]], as the planet's [[atmosphere]]; however, because few scientists understood Russian outside of Russia, his discovery was not widely credited until 1910.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvii.</ref>\n\nSome changes in periodicals occurred during the course of the Enlightenment. First, they increased in number and size. There was also a move away from publishing in Latin in favour of publishing in the vernacular. Experimental descriptions became more detailed and began to be accompanied by reviews.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/>  In the late 18th century, a second change occurred when a new breed of periodical began to publish monthly about new developments and experiments in the scientific community. The first of this kind of journal was [[Fran\u00e7ois Rozier]]'s ''Observations sur la physiques, sur l\u2019histoire naturelle et sur les arts'', commonly referred to as \"Rozier\u2019s journal\", which was first published in 1772. The journal allowed new scientific developments to be published relatively quickly compared to annuals and quarterlies. A third important change was the specialization seen in the new development of disciplinary journals. With a wider audience and ever increasing publication material, specialized journals such as Curtis\u2019 ''[[Botanical Magazine]]'' (1787) and the ''[[Annals de Chimie]]'' (1789) reflect the growing division between scientific disciplines in the Enlightenment era.<ref>Porter, (2003), p.96.</ref>\n\n==Encyclopedias and dictionaries==\n\nAlthough the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]] spanned into ancient times, and would be nothing new to Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 144.</ref> The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers\u2019 tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].\n\nAlong with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 172.</ref> The historian [[Charles Porset]], commenting on alphabetization, has said that \u201cas the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment.\u201d For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].<ref>Porter, (2003), pp. 249-50.</ref> Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Reason as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 144</ref> In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780\u20131789).<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 168)</ref> Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 172</ref>\n\nThe first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris\u2019 book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris\u2019 model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]\u2019 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris\u2019. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]], and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|\"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]\", the structure that the Encyclop\u00e9die organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'', and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine, while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nHowever, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 153.</ref> The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail. In d\u2019Alembert\u2019s ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work\u2019s massive goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:\n\n{{quote|As an Encyclop\u00e9die, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.<ref>d\u2019Alembert, p. 4.</ref>}}\n\nThe massive work was arranged according to a \u201ctree of knowledge.\" The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by  philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment\u2019s desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree\u2019s design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 7.</ref> As the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 37.</ref> The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Popularization of science==\n\nOne of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.<ref>Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp. 82-83</ref> Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \u201cto make information available to the greatest number of people.\u201d<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 15</ref> As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame  for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 19.</ref>\n\n===British coffeehouses===\n\nAn early example of science emanating from the official institutions into the public realm was the British [[coffeehouse]]. With the establishment of coffeehouses, a new public forum for political, philosophical and scientific discourse was created. In the mid-16th century, coffeehouses cropped up around [[Oxford]], where the academic community began to capitalize on the unregulated conversation that the coffeehouse allowed.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 91.</ref> The new social space began to be used by some scholars as a place to discuss science and experiments outside of the laboratory of the official institution.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 106.</ref> Coffeehouse patrons were only required to purchase a dish of coffee to participate, leaving the opportunity for many, regardless of financial means, to benefit from the conversation. Education was a central theme and some patrons began offering lessons and lectures to others. The chemist [[Peter Staehl]] provided chemistry lessons at Tilliard\u2019s coffeehouse in the early 1660s. As coffeehouses developed in [[London]], customers heard lectures on scientific subjects, such as astronomy and mathematics, for an exceedingly low price.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 99.</ref>  Notable Coffeehouse enthusiasts included [[John Aubrey]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|James Brydges]], and [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>Cowen, (2005), pp. 96-109.</ref>\n\n===Public lectures===\n\nPublic lecture courses offered some scientists who were unaffiliated with official organizations a forum to transmit scientific knowledge, at times even their own ideas, and the opportunity to carve out a reputation and, in some instances, a living. The public, on the other hand, gained both knowledge and entertainment from demonstration lectures.<ref>For a detailed analysis of public lectures, see Geoffrey Sutton, ''Science for a Polite Society: Gender, Culture, and the Demonstration of Enlightenment'' (Colorado: Westview Press, 1995). Margaret Jacob offers a more specific analysis of lecturers in Holland and England in ''The Cultural Meaning of the Scientific Revolution'' ( New York: Knopf, 1988).</ref> Between 1735 and 1793, there were over seventy individuals offering courses and demonstrations for public viewers in experimental physics. Class sizes ranged from one hundred to four or five hundred attendees.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 19</ref> Courses varied in duration from one to four weeks, to a few months, or even the entire academic year. Courses were offered at virtually any time of day; the latest occurred at 8:00 or 9:00 at night. One of the most popular start times was 6:00 pm, allowing the working population to participate and signifying the attendance of the nonelite.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 26-27</ref> Barred from the universities and other institutions, women were often in attendance at demonstration lectures and constituted a significant number of [[Academic audit|auditors]].<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 18</ref>\n\nThe importance of the lectures was not in teaching complex mathematics or physics, but rather in demonstrating to the wider public the principles of physics and encouraging discussion and debate. Generally, individuals presenting the lectures did not adhere to any particular brand of physics, but rather demonstrated a combination of different theories.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 29-31</ref> New advancements in the study of electricity offered viewers demonstrations that drew far more inspiration among the laity than scientific papers could hold. An example of a popular demonstration used by [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] and other lecturers was the \u2018electrified boy\u2019. In the demonstration, a young boy would be suspended from the ceiling, horizontal to the floor, with silk chords. An electrical machine would then be used to electrify the boy. Essentially becoming a magnet, he would then attract a collection of items scattered about him by the lecturer. Sometimes a young girl would be called from the auditors to touch or kiss the boy on the cheek, causing sparks to shoot between the two children in what was dubbed the \u2018electric kiss\u2018.<ref>Sutton, (1995), pp. 304-305.</ref> Such marvels would certainly have entertained the audience, but the demonstration of physical principles also served an educational purpose. One 18th-century lecturer insisted on the utility of his demonstrations, stating that they were \u201cuseful for the good of society.\u201d <ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 34</ref>\n\n===Popular science in print===\n\nIncreasing literacy rates in Europe during the course of the Enlightenment enabled science to enter popular culture through print. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 300.</ref> [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton\u2019s theories beyond scientific academies and the university.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]].]]\n\n== However, science took an ever greater step towards popular culture before Voltaire\u2019s introduction and Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s translation. The publication of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686) marked the first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind. The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.<ref>Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90</ref> These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Lead-better's ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as \u201ca Work entirely New\u201d that would include \u201cshort and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables.\u201d<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 90.</ref> [[Francesco Algarotti]], writing for a growing female audience, published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Embarkation. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 92.</ref> During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children entitled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 107.</ref> \nThe influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton\u2019s death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 158\">Burns, (2003), entry: 158.</ref> [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700\u20131748) penned his \u201cPoem to the Memory of Newton,\u201d which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy:<br>\n\n<center><blockquote>\nThy swift career is with whirling orbs, <br>\nComparing things with things in rapture loft, <br>\nAnd grateful adoration, for that light, <br>\nSo plenteous ray'd into thy mind below.<ref>Thomson, (1786), p. 203.</ref>\n</blockquote></center>\n\nWhile references to the sciences were often positive, there were some Enlightenment writers who criticized scientists for what they viewed as their obsessive, frivolous careers. Other antiscience writers, including [[William Blake]], chastised scientists for attempting to use physics, mechanics and mathematics to simplify the complexities of the universe, particularly in relation to God. The character of the evil scientist was invoked during this period in the romantic tradition. For example, the characterization of the scientist as a nefarious manipulator in the work of [[Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann]].<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 158\"/>\n\n==Women in science==\n\n[[File:Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A portrait of [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova]].]]\nDuring the Enlightenment era, women were excluded from scientific societies, universities and learned professions. Women were educated, if at all, through self-study, tutors, and by the teachings of more open-minded fathers. With the exception of daughters of craftsmen, who sometimes learned their father\u2019s profession by assisting in the workshop, learned women were primarily part of elite society.<ref>Kors, (2003), \u201cEducation\u201d</ref> A consequence of the exclusion of women from societies and universities that prevented much independent research was their inability to access scientific instruments, such as the microscope. In fact, restrictions were so severe in the 18th century that women, including midwives, were forbidden to use [[forceps]].<ref>Whitehead, (1991), p. 227.</ref> That particular restriction exemplified the increasingly constrictive, male-dominated medical community. Over the course of the 18th century, male surgeons began to assume the role of midwives in gynaecology. Some male satirists also ridiculed scientifically minded women, describing them as neglectful of their domestic role.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\">Burns, (2003), entry: 253.</ref> The negative view of women in the sciences reflected the  sentiment apparent in some Enlightenment texts that women need not, nor ought to be educated; the opinion is  exemplified by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in ''\u00c9mile'':\n\n{{cquote|A woman\u2019s education must... be planned in relation to man. To be pleasing in his sight, to win his respect and love, to train him in childhood, to tend him in manhood, to counsel and console, to make his life pleasant and happy, these are the duties of woman for all time, and this is what she should be taught while she is young.}}<ref>Kors, (2003), \u201cEducation.\u201d</ref>\n\n[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Portrait of M. and Mme Lavoisier'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1788 (Metropolitan Museum)]]\nDespite these limitations, there was support for women in the sciences among some men, and many made valuable contributions to science during the 18th century. Two notable women who managed to participate in formal institutions were [[Laura Bassi]] and the Russian Princess [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Yekaterina Dashkova]]. Bassi was an Italian physicist who received a PhD from the University of Bologna and began teaching there in 1732. Dashkova became the director of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg in 1783. Her personal relationship with Empress [[Catherine the Great]] (r. 1762-1796) allowed her to obtain the position, which marked in history the first appointment of a woman to the directorship of a scientific academy.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\"/>\n\nMore commonly, women participated in the sciences through an association with a male relative or spouse. [[Caroline Herschel]] began her astronomical career, although somewhat reluctantly at first, by assisting her brother [[William Herschel]]. Caroline Herschel is most remembered for her discovery of eight comets and her ''Index to Flamsteed\u2019s Observations of the Fixed Stars'' (1798). On August 1, 1786, Herschel discovered her first comet, much to the excitement of scientifically minded women. [[Fanny Burney]] commented on the discovery, stating that \u201cthe comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance; but it is the first lady\u2019s comet, and I was very desirous to see it.\u201d<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 161.</ref> [[Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze]] worked collaboratively with her husband, [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Aside from assisting in Lavoisier\u2019s laboratory research, she was responsible for translating a number of English texts into French for her husband\u2019s work on the new chemistry. Paulze also illustrated many of her husband\u2019s publications, such as his ''Treatise on Chemistry'' (1789). [[Eva Ekeblad]] became the first woman inducted into the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]] (1748).\n\nMany other women became illustrators or translators of scientific texts. In France, [[Fran\u00e7oise Basseporte|Madeleine Fran\u00e7oise Basseporte]] was employed by the Royal Botanical Garden as an illustrator. Englishwoman [[Mary Delany]] developed a unique method of illustration. Her technique involved using hundreds of pieces of coloured-paper to recreate lifelike renditions of living plants. German born [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] along with her daughters including [[Dorothea Maria Graff]] were involved in the careful scientific study of insects and the natural world. Using mostly watercolor, gauche on vellum, She became one of the leading entomologist of the 18th century. They were also one of the first female entomologists who took a scientific trip to Suriname to study plant life for a total of a five year span.\n\nNoblewomen sometimes cultivated their own botanical gardens, including [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630\u20131715)|Mary Somerset]] and [[Margaret Harley]]. Scientific translation sometimes required more than a grasp on multiple languages. Besides translating Newton\u2019s ''Principia'' into French, [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] expanded Newton\u2019s work to include recent progress made in mathematical physics after his death.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\" />\n\n==Disciplines==\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main|History of Astronomy}}\n\nBuilding on the body of work forwarded by [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], 18th-century astronomers refined [[telescopes]], produced [[star catalogue]]s, and worked towards explaining the motions of heavenly bodies and the consequences of [[universal gravitation]].<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 328.</ref> Among the prominent astronomers of the age was [[Edmund Halley]]. In 1705, Halley correctly linked historical descriptions of particularly bright comets to the reappearance of just one, which would later be named [[Halley\u2019s Comet]], based on his computation of the orbits of comets.<ref>Turner, (1963), p. 88.</ref> Halley also changed the theory of the Newtonian universe, which described the fixed stars. When he compared the ancient positions of stars to their contemporary positions, he found that they had shifted.<ref>Hoskin, (1999), p. 174.</ref> [[James Bradley]], while attempting to document [[stellar parallax]], realized that the unexplained motion of stars he had early observed with [[Samuel Molyneux]] was caused by the [[aberration of light]]. The discovery was proof of a [[heliocentric]] model of the universe, since it is the revolution of the earth around the sun that causes an apparent motion in the observed position of a star. The discovery also led Bradley to a fairly close estimate to the speed of light.<ref>Mason, (1962), p. 297.</ref>[[File:Herschel 40 foot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[William Herschel]]'s 40 foot (12 m) telescope.]]\n\nObservations of Venus in the 18th century became an important step in describing atmospheres. During the 1761 [[transit of Venus]], the Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] observed a ring of light around the planet. Lomonosov attributed the ring to the refraction of sunlight, which he correctly hypothesized was caused by the atmosphere of Venus. Further evidence of Venus' atmosphere was gathered in observations by [[Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter]] in 1779.<ref>Schectman, (2003), pp. xxxvii, xl.</ref>  The planet also offered [[Alexis Claude de Clairaut]] an opportunity to work his considerable mathematical skills when he computed the mass of Venus through complex mathematical calculations.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\nHowever, much astronomical work of the period becomes shadowed by one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of the 18th century. On 13 March 1781, amateur astronomer [[William Herschel]] spotted a new planet with his powerful [[reflecting telescope]]. Initially identified as a comet, the celestial body later came to be accepted as a planet.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xlii.</ref> Soon after, the planet was named ''Georgium Sidus'' by Herschel and was called Herschelium in France. The name [[Uranus]], as proposed by [[Johann Obama]], came into widespread usage after Herschel's death.<ref>Littmann, (2004), p. 11.</ref> On the theoretical side of astronomy, the English natural philosopher [[John Michell]] first proposed the existence of [[dark star (Newtonian mechanics)|dark star]]s in 1783. Michell postulated that if the density of a stellar object became great enough, its attractive force would become so large that even light could not escape.<ref>Parker, (1991), p. 4.</ref> He also surmised that the location of a dark star could be determined by the strong [[gravitational force]] it would exert on surrounding stars. While differing somewhat from a [[black hole]], the dark star can be understood as a predecessor to the black holes resulting from [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[general theory of relativity]].<ref>Silver, (1998), p. 460.</ref>\n\n===Chemistry===\n{{Main|History of Chemistry}}\n\nThe [[chemical revolution]] was a period in the 18th century marked by significant advancements in the theory and practice of chemistry. Despite the maturity of most of the sciences during the scientific revolution, by the mid-18th century chemistry had yet to outline a systematic framework or theoretical doctrine. Elements of alchemy still permeated the study of chemistry, and the belief that the natural world was composed of the [[classical elements]] of earth, water, air and fire remained prevalent.<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 265.</ref> The key achievement of the chemical revolution has traditionally been viewed as the abandonment of [[phlogiston theory]] in favor of [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s oxygen theory of [[combustion]];<ref>See H. Butterfield,  \"Chapter 11\" of ''The Origins of Modern Science: 1300-1800'' (New York: Macmillan, 1957) for this traditional view.</ref> however, more recent studies attribute a wider range of factors as contributing forces behind the chemical revolution.<ref>Perrin, (1988), pp. 32-81.</ref>\n\nDeveloped under [[Johann Joachim Becher]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Georg Ernst]], histologist theory was an attempt to account for products of combustion.<ref name=\"Idhe, 1964, p. 61\">Idhe, (1964), p. 61</ref> According to the theory, a substance called [[phlogiston]] was released from [[Combustibility and flammability|flammable]] materials through burning. The resulting product was termed ''calx'', which was considered a 'dephlogisticated' substance in its 'true' form.<ref>Conant, (1950), p. 14.</ref> The first strong evidence against phlogiston theory came from pneumatic chemists in Britain during the later half of the 18th century. [[Joseph Black]], [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] all identified different gases that composed air; however, it was not until Antoine Lavoisier discovered in the fall of 1772 that, when burned, [[sulphur]] and [[phosphorus]] \u201cgain[ed] in weight\u201d<ref name=\"Idhe, 1964, p. 61\"/> that the phlogiston theory began to unravel.\n\nLavoisier subsequently discovered and named [[oxygen]], described its role in animal [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]<ref>Idhe, (1964), pp. 68-69</ref> and the [[calcination]] of metals exposed to air (1774\u20131778). In 1783, Lavoisier found that water was a compound of oxygen and [[hydrogen]].<ref>Conant, (1950), p. 12.</ref> Lavoisier\u2019s years of experimentation formed a body of work that contested phlogiston theory. After reading his \u201cReflections on Phlogiston\u201d to the Academy in 1785, chemists began dividing into camps based on the old phlogiston theory and the new oxygen theory.<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 273.</ref> A new form of [[chemical nomenclature]], developed by [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], with assistance from Lavoisier, classified elements [[binomially]] into a [[genus]] and a [[species]]. For example, burned lead was of the genus [[oxide]] and species [[lead]].<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 264.</ref> Transition to and acceptance of Lavoisier\u2019s new chemistry varied in pace across Europe. The new chemistry was established in Glasgow and Edinburgh early in the 1790s, but was slow to become established in Germany.<ref>Olby, (1990), pp. 274-5.</ref> Eventually the oxygen-based theory of combustion drowned out the phlogiston theory and in the process created the basis of modern chemistry.<ref>McClellan, (2006) p. 301</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Enlightenment}}\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Rationalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n:Butterfield, H. 1957.

Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century [[Scientific Revolution]] until roughly the 19th century, after the [[French Revolution]] (1789) and the [[Napoleonic era]] (1799\u20131815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first [[Learned society|scientific societies]], the rise of [[Heliocentrism|Copernicanism]], and the displacement of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian natural philosophy]] and [[Galen|Galen\u2019s]] ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]] lost scientific credibility.\n\nWhile the Enlightenment cannot be pigeonholed into a specific doctrine or set of dogmas, science came to play a leading role in Enlightenment discourse and thought. Many Enlightenment writers and thinkers had backgrounds in the sciences and associated scientific advancement with the overthrow of religion and traditional authority in favour of the development of free speech and thought. Broadly speaking, Enlightenment science greatly valued [[empiricism]] and rational thought, and was embedded with the Enlightenment ideal of advancement and progress. As with most Enlightenment views, the benefits of science were not seen universally; [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] criticized the sciences for distancing man from nature and not operating to make people happier.<ref>Burns (2003), entry: 7,103.</ref>\n\nScience during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and [[Academy|academies]], which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbone of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the [[popular culture|popularization]] of science among an increasingly literate population. [[Philosophe]]s introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' and the popularization of [[Newtonianism]] by [[Voltaire]] as well as by \u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet, the French translator of Newton's Principia. Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the [[history of science]];<ref>see Hall (1954), iii; Mason (1956), 223.</ref> however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]; the development of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]; a new understanding of [[magnetism]] and [[electricity]]; and the maturation of [[chemistry]] as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry.\n\n==Universities==\n\n[[File:Original Yale College Building.jpg|thumb|230px|right|The original building at [[Yale]], 1718\u20131782]]\nThe number of universities in Paris remained relatively constant throughout the 18th century. Europe had about 105 universities and colleges by 1700. North America had 44, including the newly founded [[Harvard]] and [[Yale]].<ref>Porter (2003), 44.</ref> The number of university students remained roughly the same throughout the Enlightenment in most Western nations, excluding Britain, where the number of institutions and students increased.<ref>Porter (2003), 52.</ref> University students were generally males from affluent families, seeking a career in either medicine, law, or the Church. The universities themselves existed primarily to educate future [[physician]]s, [[lawyer]]s and members of the [[clergy]].<ref>Porter (2003), 45.</ref>\n\nThe study of science under the heading of [[natural philosophy]] was divided into physics and a conglomerate grouping of chemistry and [[natural history]], which included [[anatomy]], biology, [[geology]], [[mineralogy]], and [[zoology]].<ref>Porter (2003), 79-80.</ref>  Most European universities taught a [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] form of [[mechanical philosophy]] in the early 18th century, and only slowly adopted Newtonianism in the mid-18th century. A notable exception were universities in [[Spain]], which under the influence of [[Catholicism]] focused almost entirely on Aristotelian natural philosophy until the mid-18th century; they were among the last universities to do so. Another exception occurred in the universities of [[Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], where [[University of Halle]] professor [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] taught a form of Cartesianism modified by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]ian physics.<ref>Burns (2003), entry: 239.</ref>\n\n[[File:Boyle air pump.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Robert Boyle]]'s air-pump, used in the demonstration lectures of [[Pierre Polini\u00e8re]].]]\nBefore the 18th century, science courses were taught almost exclusively through formal [[lecture]]s. The structure of courses began to change in the first decades of the 18th century, when [[scientific demonstration|physical demonstrations]] were added to lectures. [[Pierre Polini\u00e8re]] and [[Jacques Rohault]] were among the first individuals to provide demonstrations of physical principles in the classroom. Experiments ranged from swinging a bucket of water at the end of a rope, demonstrating that [[centrifugal force]] would hold the water in the bucket, to more impressive experiments involving the use of an [[Vacuum pump|air-pump]].<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 195.)</ref> One particularly dramatic air-pump demonstration involved placing an apple inside the glass receiver of the air-pump, and removing air until the resulting vacuum caused the apple to explode.<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 199.</ref> Polini\u00e8re\u2019s demonstrations were so impressive that he was granted an invitation to present his course to [[Louis XV]] in 1722.<ref>Sutton, (1995), p. 195.</ref>\n\nSome attempts at reforming the structure of the science curriculum were made during the 18th century and the first decades of the 19th century. Beginning around 1745, the [[Hats (party)|Hats party]] in Sweden made propositions to reform the university system by separating natural philosophy into two separate faculties of physics and mathematics. The propositions were never put into action, but they represent the growing calls for institutional reform in the later part of the 18th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 54.</ref> In 1777, the study of arts at [[Cracow]] and [[Vilna]] in [[Poland]] was divided into the two new faculties of [[moral philosophy]] and physics. However, the reform did not survive beyond 1795 and the [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partition]]. During the French Revolution, all colleges and universities in France were abolished and reformed in 1808 under the single institution of the ''Universit\u00e9 imperiale''. The ''Universit\u00e9'' divided the arts and sciences into separate faculties, something that had never before been done before in Europe. The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] employed the same system in 1815. However, the other countries of Europe did not adopt a similar division of the faculties until the mid-19th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 55.</ref>\n\n[[File:Entrance of Goettingen.JPG|thumb|230px|The old entrance to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]]|right]]\nUniversities in France tended to serve a downplayed role in the development of science during the Enlightenment; that role was dominated by the scientific academies, such as the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. The contributions of universities in Britain were mixed. On the one hand, the [[University of Cambridge]] began teaching Newtonianism early in the Enlightenment, but failed to become a central force behind the advancement of science. On the other end of the spectrum were Scottish universities, which had strong medical faculties and became centres of scientific development.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 239\">Burns, (2003), entry: 239.</ref> Under [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], German universities began to promote the sciences. [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]]'s unique blend of Cartesian-Leibnizian physics began to be adopted in universities outside of Halle. The [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], founded in 1734, was far more liberal than its counterparts, allowing professors to plan their own courses and select their own textbooks.

After 1700 a tremendous number of official academies and societies were founded in Europe and by 1789 there were over seventy official scientific societies . In reference to this growth, [[Bernard de Fontenelle]] coined the term \u201cthe Age of Academies\u201d to describe the 18th century.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 90.</ref>\n\nNational scientific societies were founded throughout the Enlightenment era in the urban hotbeds of scientific development across Europe. In the 17th century the [[Royal Society of London]] (1662), the Paris ''[[Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences]]'' (1666), and the Berlin ''[[Akademie der Wissenschaften]]'' (1700) were founded. Around the start of the 18th century, the ''[[Academia Scientiarum Imperialis]]'' (1724) in [[St. Petersburg]], and the ''[[Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien]]'' (Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences) (1739) were created. Regional and provincial societies emerged from the 18th century in [[Bologna]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Dijon]], [[Lyon]]s, [[Montpellier]] and [[Uppsala]]. Following this initial period of growth, societies were founded between 1752 and 1785 in [[Barcelona]], [[Brussels]], [[Dublin]], [[Edinburgh]], G\u00f6ttingen, [[Mannheim]], [[Munich]], [[Padua]] and [[Turin]]. The development of unchartered societies, such as the private the ''[[Naturforschende Gesellschaft]]'' of [[Danzig]] (1743) and [[Lunar Society]] of Birmingham (1766\u20131791), occurred alongside the growth of national, regional and provincial societies.<ref>Porter, (2003), pp. 90-91.</ref>\n\n[[File:Kunstkamera (Saint-Petersburg).jpg|thumb|250px|Original headquarters of the Imperial Academy of Sciences - the [[Kunstkammer]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].|right]]\nOfficial scientific societies were chartered by the state in order to provide technical expertise.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 91.</ref> This advisory capacity offered scientific societies the most direct contact between the scientific community and government bodies available during the Enlightenment.<ref>Gillispie, (1980), p. xxiii.</ref> State sponsorship was beneficial to the societies as it brought finance and recognition, along with a measure of freedom in management. Most societies were granted permission to oversee their own publications, control the election of new members, and the administration of the society.<ref>See Gillispie, (1980), \u201cConclusion.\u201d</ref> Membership in academies and societies was therefore highly selective. In some societies, members were required to pay an annual fee to participate. For example, the Royal Society depended on contributions from its members, which excluded a wide range of artisans and mathematicians on account of the expense.<ref>Daston, (1998), p. 71</ref> Society activities included research, experimentation, sponsoring essay prize contests, and collaborative projects between societies. A dialogue of formal communication also developed between societies and society in general through the publication of [[scientific journal]]s. [[Periodicals]] offered society members the opportunity to publish, and for their ideas to be consumed by other scientific societies and the literate public. Scientific journals, readily accessible to members of learned societies, became the most important form of publication for scientists during the Enlightenment.<ref>Gillispie, (1980), p. xxi.</ref>\n\n==Periodicals==\n\n[[File:1665 phil trans vol i title.png|thumb|210px|Cover of the first volume of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]],'' 1665-1666|left]]\nAcademies and societies served to disseminate Enlightenment science by publishing the scientific works of their members, as well as their proceedings. At the beginning of the 18th century, the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', published by the Royal Society of London, was the only scientific periodical being published on a regular, [[quarterly]] basis. The Paris Academy of Sciences, formed in 1666, began publishing in volumes of memoirs rather than a quarterly journal, with periods between volumes sometimes lasting years. While some official periodicals may have published more frequently, there was still a long delay from a paper\u2019s submission for review to its actual publication. Smaller periodicals, such as ''[[American Philosophical Society|Transactions of the American Philosophical Society]]'', were only published when enough content was available to complete a volume.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\">Burns, (2003), entry: 199.</ref> At the Paris Academy, there was an average delay of three years for publication. At one point the period extended to seven years.<ref>Porter, (2003), p.95.</ref> The Paris Academy processed submitted articles through the ''[[Comit\u00e9 de Librarie]]'', which had the final word on what would or would not be published.<ref>McClellan, (2003), pp. 11-18</ref> In 1703, the mathematician [[Antoine Parent]] began a periodical, ''Researches in Physics and Mathematics'', specifically to publish papers that had been rejected by the ''Comit\u00e9''.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/>\n\n[[File:1665 journal des scavans title.jpg|thumb|The first issue of the ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' ]]\nThe limitations of such academic journals left considerable space for the rise of independent periodicals. Some eminent examples include [[Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch]]'s ''[[Der Naturforscher]]'' (The Natural Investigator) (1725\u20131778), ''[[Journal des s\u00e7avans]]'' (1665\u20131792), the [[Jesuit]] ''[[M\u00e9moires de Tr\u00e9voux]]'' (1701\u20131779), and Leibniz\u2019s ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' (Reports/Acts of the Scholars) (1682\u20131782). Independent periodicals were published throughout the Enlightenment and excited scientific interest in the general public.<ref>Lynn, (2006), p.16</ref> While the journals of the academies primarily published scientific papers, independent periodicals were a mix of reviews, abstracts, translations of foreign texts, and sometimes derivative, reprinted materials.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/> Most of these texts were published in the local vernacular, so their continental spread depended on the language of the readers.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 195</ref> For example, in 1761 Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] correctly attributed the ring of light around [[Venus]], visible during the planet\u2019s [[Transit of Venus|transit]], as the planet's [[atmosphere]]; however, because few scientists understood Russian outside of Russia, his discovery was not widely credited until 1910.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvii.</ref>\n\nSome changes in periodicals occurred during the course of the Enlightenment. First, they increased in number and size. There was also a move away from publishing in Latin in favour of publishing in the vernacular. Experimental descriptions became more detailed and began to be accompanied by reviews.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 199\"/>  In the late 18th century, a second change occurred when a new breed of periodical began to publish monthly about new developments and experiments in the scientific community. The first of this kind of journal was [[Fran\u00e7ois Rozier]]'s ''Observations sur la physiques, sur l\u2019histoire naturelle et sur les arts'', commonly referred to as \"Rozier\u2019s journal\", which was first published in 1772. The journal allowed new scientific developments to be published relatively quickly compared to annuals and quarterlies. A third important change was the specialization seen in the new development of disciplinary journals. With a wider audience and ever increasing publication material, specialized journals such as Curtis\u2019 ''[[Botanical Magazine]]'' (1787) and the ''[[Annals de Chimie]]'' (1789) reflect the growing division between scientific disciplines in the Enlightenment era.<ref>Porter, (2003), p.96.</ref>\n\n==Encyclopedias and dictionaries==\n\nAlthough the existence of [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedia]] spanned into ancient times, and would be nothing new to Enlightenment readers, the texts changed from simply defining words in a long running list to far more detailed discussions of those words in 18th-century [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]].<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 144.</ref> The works were part of an Enlightenment movement to systematize knowledge and provide education to a wider audience than the educated elite. As the 18th century progressed, the content of encyclopedias also changed according to readers\u2019 tastes. Volumes tended to focus more strongly on [[secular]] affairs, particularly science and technology, rather than matters of [[theology]].\n\nAlong with secular matters, readers also favoured an alphabetical ordering scheme over cumbersome works arranged along thematic lines.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 172.</ref> The historian [[Charles Porset]], commenting on alphabetization, has said that \u201cas the zero degree of taxonomy, alphabetical order authorizes all reading strategies; in this respect it could be considered an emblem of the Enlightenment.\u201d For Porset, the avoidance of thematic and [[hierarchical]] systems thus allows free interpretation of the works and becomes an example of [[egalitarianism]].<ref>Porter, (2003), pp. 249-50.</ref> Encyclopedias and dictionaries also became more popular during the Age of Reason as the number of educated consumers who could afford such texts began to multiply.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 144</ref> In the later half of the 18th century, the number of dictionaries and encyclopedias published by decade increased from 63 between 1760 and 1769 to approximately 148 in the decade proceeding the French Revolution (1780\u20131789).<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 168)</ref> Along with growth in numbers, dictionaries and encyclopedias also grew in length, often having multiple print runs that sometimes included in supplemented editions.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 172</ref>\n\nThe first technical dictionary was drafted by [[John Harris (writer)|John Harris]] and entitled ''[[Lexicon technicum|Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]''. Harris\u2019 book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the ''Lexicon technicum'' was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial [[arithmetic]] along with the physical sciences and [[navigation]]. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris\u2019 model, including [[Ephraim Chambers]]\u2019 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris\u2019. The [[Book binding|folio]] edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The ''Cyclopaedia'' emphasized Newtonian theories, [[John Locke|Lockean]] philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as [[engraving]], [[brewing]], and [[dyeing]]. [[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|250px|thumb|left|\"[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]\", the structure that the Encyclop\u00e9die organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination]] In Germany, practical reference works intended for the uneducated majority became popular in the 18th century. The ''Marperger Curieuses Natur-, Kunst-, Berg-, Gewerkund Handlungs-Lexicon'' (1712) explained terms that usefully described the trades and scientific and commercial education. ''Jablonksi Allgemeines Lexicon'' (1721) was better known than the ''Handlungs-Lexicon'', and underscored technical subjects rather than scientific theory. For example, over five columns of text were dedicated to wine, while geometry and [[logic]] were allocated only twenty-two and seventeen lines, respectively. The first edition of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (1771) was modelled along the same lines as the German lexicons.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 150-152.</ref>\n\nHowever, the prime example of reference works that systematized scientific knowledge in the age of Enlightenment were [[universal encyclopedia]]s rather than technical dictionaries. It was the goal of universal encyclopedias to record all human knowledge in a comprehensive reference work.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 153.</ref> The most well-known of these works is [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers]]''. The work, which began publication in 1751, was composed of thirty-five volumes and over 71 000 separate entries. A great number of the entries were dedicated to describing the sciences and crafts in detail. In d\u2019Alembert\u2019s ''Preliminary Discourse to the Encyclopedia of Diderot'', the work\u2019s massive goal to record the extent of human knowledge in the arts and sciences is outlined:\n\n{{cquote|As an Encyclop\u00e9die, it is to set forth as well as possible the order and connection of the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles that form the basis of each science and each art, liberal or mechanical, and the most essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.}}<ref>d\u2019Alembert, p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe massive work was arranged according to a \u201ctree of knowledge.\" The tree reflected the marked division between the arts and sciences, which was largely a result of the rise of empiricism. Both areas of knowledge were united by  philosophy, or the trunk of the tree of knowledge. The Enlightenment\u2019s desacrilization of religion was pronounced in the tree\u2019s design, particularly where theology accounted for a peripheral branch, with black magic as a close neighbour.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 7.</ref> As the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' gained popularity, it was published in [[book binding|quarto]] and [[book binding|octavo]] editions after 1777. The quarto and octavo editions were much less expensive than previous editions, making the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' more accessible to the non-elite. Robert Darnton estimates that there were approximately 25 000 copies of the ''Encyclop\u00e9die'' in circulation throughout France and Europe before the French Revolution.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 37.</ref> The extensive, yet affordable encyclopedia came to represent the transmission of Enlightenment and scientific education to an expanding audience.<ref>Darnton, (1979), p. 6.</ref>\n\n==Popularization of science==\n\nOne of the most important developments that the Enlightenment era brought to the discipline of science was its popularization. An increasingly literate population seeking knowledge and education in both the arts and the sciences drove the expansion of print culture and the dissemination of scientific learning. The new literate population was due to a high rise in the availability of food. This enabled many people to rise out of poverty, and instead of paying more for food, they had money for education.<ref>Jacob, (1988), p. 191; Melton, (2001), pp. 82-83</ref> Popularization was generally part of an overarching Enlightenment ideal that endeavoured \u201cto make information available to the greatest number of people.\u201d<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 15</ref> As public interest in natural philosophy grew during the 18th century, public lecture courses and the publication of popular texts opened up new roads to money and fame  for amateurs and scientists who remained on the periphery of universities and academies.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 19.</ref>\n\n===British coffeehouses===\n\nAn early example of science emanating from the official institutions into the public realm was the British [[coffeehouse]]. With the establishment of coffeehouses, a new public forum for political, philosophical and scientific discourse was created. In the mid-16th century, coffeehouses cropped up around [[Oxford]], where the academic community began to capitalize on the unregulated conversation that the coffeehouse allowed.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 91.</ref> The new social space began to be used by some scholars as a place to discuss science and experiments outside of the laboratory of the official institution.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 106.</ref> Coffeehouse patrons were only required to purchase a dish of coffee to participate, leaving the opportunity for many, regardless of financial means, to benefit from the conversation. Education was a central theme and some patrons began offering lessons and lectures to others. The chemist [[Peter Staehl]] provided chemistry lessons at Tilliard\u2019s coffeehouse in the early 1660s. As coffeehouses developed in [[London]], customers heard lectures on scientific subjects, such as astronomy and mathematics, for an exceedingly low price.<ref>Cowen, (2005), p. 99.</ref>  Notable Coffeehouse enthusiasts included [[John Aubrey]], [[Robert Hooke]], [[James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos|James Brydges]], and [[Samuel Pepys]].<ref>Cowen, (2005), pp. 96-109.</ref>\n\n===Public lectures===\n\nPublic lecture courses offered some scientists who were unaffiliated with official organizations a forum to transmit scientific knowledge, at times even their own ideas, and the opportunity to carve out a reputation and, in some instances, a living. The public, on the other hand, gained both knowledge and entertainment from demonstration lectures.<ref>For a detailed analysis of public lectures, see Geoffrey Sutton, ''Science for a Polite Society: Gender, Culture, and the Demonstration of Enlightenment'' (Colorado: Westview Press, 1995). Margaret Jacob offers a more specific analysis of lecturers in Holland and England in ''The Cultural Meaning of the Scientific Revolution'' ( New York: Knopf, 1988).</ref> Between 1735 and 1793, there were over seventy individuals offering courses and demonstrations for public viewers in experimental physics. Class sizes ranged from one hundred to four or five hundred attendees.<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 19</ref> Courses varied in duration from one to four weeks, to a few months, or even the entire academic year. Courses were offered at virtually any time of day; the latest occurred at 8:00 or 9:00 at night. One of the most popular start times was 6:00 pm, allowing the working population to participate and signifying the attendance of the nonelite.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 26-27</ref> Barred from the universities and other institutions, women were often in attendance at demonstration lectures and constituted a significant number of [[Academic audit|auditors]].<ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 18</ref>\n\nThe importance of the lectures was not in teaching complex mathematics or physics, but rather in demonstrating to the wider public the principles of physics and encouraging discussion and debate. Generally, individuals presenting the lectures did not adhere to any particular brand of physics, but rather demonstrated a combination of different theories.<ref>Headrick, (2000), pp. 29-31</ref> New advancements in the study of electricity offered viewers demonstrations that drew far more inspiration among the laity than scientific papers could hold. An example of a popular demonstration used by [[Jean-Antoine Nollet]] and other lecturers was the \u2018electrified boy\u2019. In the demonstration, a young boy would be suspended from the ceiling, horizontal to the floor, with silk chords. An electrical machine would then be used to electrify the boy. Essentially becoming a magnet, he would then attract a collection of items scattered about him by the lecturer. Sometimes a young girl would be called from the auditors to touch or kiss the boy on the cheek, causing sparks to shoot between the two children in what was dubbed the \u2018electric kiss\u2018.<ref>Sutton, (1995), pp. 304-305.</ref> Such marvels would certainly have entertained the audience, but the demonstration of physical principles also served an educational purpose. One 18th-century lecturer insisted on the utility of his demonstrations, stating that they were \u201cuseful for the good of society.\u201d <ref>Headrick, (2000), p. 34</ref>\n\n===Popular science in print===\n\nIncreasing literacy rates in Europe during the course of the Enlightenment enabled science to enter popular culture through print. More formal works included explanations of scientific theories for individuals lacking the educational background to comprehend the original scientific text. [[Isaac Newton|Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s]] celebrated ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' was published in Latin and remained inaccessible to readers without education in the classics until Enlightenment writers began to translate and analyze the text in the vernacular. The first French introduction to Newtonianism and the ''Principia'' was ''El\u00e9ments de la philosophie de Newton'', published by Voltaire in 1738.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 300.</ref> [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]]'s translation of the ''Principia'', published after her death in 1756, also helped to spread Newton\u2019s theories beyond scientific academies and the university.<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 101.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fontenelle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|A portrait of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]].]]\n\n== However, science took an ever greater step towards popular culture before Voltaire\u2019s introduction and Ch\u00e2telet\u2019s translation. The publication of [[Bernard de Fontenelle]]'s ''[[Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds]]'' (1686) marked the first significant work that expressed scientific theory and knowledge expressly for the laity, in the vernacular, and with the entertainment of readers in mind. The book was produced specifically for women with an interest in scientific writing and inspired a variety of similar works.<ref>Phillips, (1991), pp. 85, 90</ref> These popular works were written in a discursive style, which was laid out much more clearly for the reader than the complicated articles, treatises, and books published by the academies and scientists. Charles Lead-better's ''Astronomy'' (1727) was advertised as \u201ca Work entirely New\u201d that would include \u201cshort and easie {{sic}} Rules and Astronomical Tables.\u201d<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 90.</ref> [[Francesco Algarotti]], writing for a growing female audience, published ''Il Newtonianism per le dame'', which was a tremendously popular work and was translated from Italian into English by [[Elizabeth Carter]]. A similar introduction to Newtonianism for women was produced by Henry Embarkation. His ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton\u2019s Philosophy'' was published by subscription. Extant records of subscribers show that women from a wide range of social standings purchased the book, indicating the growing number of scientifically inclined female readers among the middling class.<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 92.</ref> During the Enlightenment, women also began producing popular scientific works themselves. [[Sarah Trimmer]] wrote a successful natural history textbook for children entitled ''The Easy Introduction to the Knowledge of Nature'' (1782), which was published for many years after in eleven editions.<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 107.</ref> \nThe influence of science also began appearing more commonly in poetry and literature during the Enlightenment. Some poetry became infused with [[scientific metaphor]] and imagery, while other poems were written directly about scientific topics. [[Sir Richard Blackmore]] committed the Newtonian system to verse in ''Creation, a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books'' (1712). After Newton\u2019s death in 1727, poems were composed in his honour for decades.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 158\">Burns, (2003), entry: 158.</ref> [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] (1700\u20131748) penned his \u201cPoem to the Memory of Newton,\u201d which mourned the loss of Newton, but also praised his science and legacy:<br>\n\n<center><blockquote>\nThy swift career is with whirling orbs, <br>\nComparing things with things in rapture loft, <br>\nAnd grateful adoration, for that light, <br>\nSo plenteous ray'd into thy mind below.<ref>Thomson, (1786), p. 203.</ref>\n</blockquote></center>\n\nWhile references to the sciences were often positive, there were some Enlightenment writers who criticized scientists for what they viewed as their obsessive, frivolous careers. Other antiscience writers, including [[William Blake]], chastised scientists for attempting to use physics, mechanics and mathematics to simplify the complexities of the universe, particularly in relation to God. The character of the evil scientist was invoked during this period in the romantic tradition. For example, the characterization of the scientist as a nefarious manipulator in the work of [[Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann]].<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 158\"/>\n\n==Women in science==\n\n[[File:Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A portrait of [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova]].]]\nDuring the Enlightenment era, women were excluded from scientific societies, universities and learned professions. Women were educated, if at all, through self-study, tutors, and by the teachings of more open-minded fathers. With the exception of daughters of craftsmen, who sometimes learned their father\u2019s profession by assisting in the workshop, learned women were primarily part of elite society.<ref>Kors, (2003), \u201cEducation\u201d</ref> A consequence of the exclusion of women from societies and universities that prevented much independent research was their inability to access scientific instruments, such as the microscope. In fact, restrictions were so severe in the 18th century that women, including midwives, were forbidden to use [[forceps]].<ref>Whitehead, (1991), p. 227.</ref> That particular restriction exemplified the increasingly constrictive, male-dominated medical community. Over the course of the 18th century, male surgeons began to assume the role of midwives in gynaecology. Some male satirists also ridiculed scientifically minded women, describing them as neglectful of their domestic role.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\">Burns, (2003), entry: 253.</ref> The negative view of women in the sciences reflected the  sentiment apparent in some Enlightenment texts that women need not, nor ought to be educated; the opinion is  exemplified by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in ''\u00c9mile'':\n\n{{cquote|A woman\u2019s education must... be planned in relation to man. To be pleasing in his sight, to win his respect and love, to train him in childhood, to tend him in manhood, to counsel and console, to make his life pleasant and happy, these are the duties of woman for all time, and this is what she should be taught while she is young.}}<ref>Kors, (2003), \u201cEducation.\u201d</ref>\n\n[[File:David - Portrait of Monsieur Lavoisier and His Wife.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Portrait of M. and Mme Lavoisier'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1788 (Metropolitan Museum)]]\nDespite these limitations, there was support for women in the sciences among some men, and many made valuable contributions to science during the 18th century. Two notable women who managed to participate in formal institutions were [[Laura Bassi]] and the Russian Princess [[Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova|Yekaterina Dashkova]]. Bassi was an Italian physicist who received a PhD from the University of Bologna and began teaching there in 1732. Dashkova became the director of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg in 1783. Her personal relationship with Empress [[Catherine the Great]] (r. 1762-1796) allowed her to obtain the position, which marked in history the first appointment of a woman to the directorship of a scientific academy.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\"/>\n\nMore commonly, women participated in the sciences through an association with a male relative or spouse. [[Caroline Herschel]] began her astronomical career, although somewhat reluctantly at first, by assisting her brother [[William Herschel]]. Caroline Herschel is most remembered for her discovery of eight comets and her ''Index to Flamsteed\u2019s Observations of the Fixed Stars'' (1798). On August 1, 1786, Herschel discovered her first comet, much to the excitement of scientifically minded women. [[Fanny Burney]] commented on the discovery, stating that \u201cthe comet was very small, and had nothing grand or striking in its appearance; but it is the first lady\u2019s comet, and I was very desirous to see it.\u201d<ref>Phillips, (1991), p. 161.</ref> [[Marie-Anne Pierette Paulze]] worked collaboratively with her husband, [[Antoine Lavoisier]]. Aside from assisting in Lavoisier\u2019s laboratory research, she was responsible for translating a number of English texts into French for her husband\u2019s work on the new chemistry. Paulze also illustrated many of her husband\u2019s publications, such as his ''Treatise on Chemistry'' (1789). [[Eva Ekeblad]] became the first woman inducted into the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Science]] (1748).\n\nMany other women became illustrators or translators of scientific texts. In France, [[Fran\u00e7oise Basseporte|Madeleine Fran\u00e7oise Basseporte]] was employed by the Royal Botanical Garden as an illustrator. Englishwoman [[Mary Delany]] developed a unique method of illustration. Her technique involved using hundreds of pieces of coloured-paper to recreate lifelike renditions of living plants. German born [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] along with her daughters including [[Dorothea Maria Graff]] were involved in the careful scientific study of insects and the natural world. Using mostly watercolor, gauche on vellum, She became one of the leading entomologist of the 18th century. They were also one of the first female entomologists who took a scientific trip to Suriname to study plant life for a total of a five year span.\n\nNoblewomen sometimes cultivated their own botanical gardens, including [[Mary Somerset, Duchess of Beaufort (1630\u20131715)|Mary Somerset]] and [[Margaret Harley]]. Scientific translation sometimes required more than a grasp on multiple languages. Besides translating Newton\u2019s ''Principia'' into French, [[\u00c9milie du Ch\u00e2telet]] expanded Newton\u2019s work to include recent progress made in mathematical physics after his death.<ref name=\"Burns, 2003, entry: 253\" />\n\n==Disciplines==\n\n===Astronomy===\n{{Main|History of Astronomy}}\n\nBuilding on the body of work forwarded by [[Copernicus]], [[Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], 18th-century astronomers refined [[telescopes]], produced [[star catalogue]]s, and worked towards explaining the motions of heavenly bodies and the consequences of [[universal gravitation]].<ref>Porter, (2003), p. 328.</ref> Among the prominent astronomers of the age was [[Edmund Halley]]. In 1705, Halley correctly linked historical descriptions of particularly bright comets to the reappearance of just one, which would later be named [[Halley\u2019s Comet]], based on his computation of the orbits of comets.<ref>Turner, (1963), p. 88.</ref> Halley also changed the theory of the Newtonian universe, which described the fixed stars. When he compared the ancient positions of stars to their contemporary positions, he found that they had shifted.<ref>Hoskin, (1999), p. 174.</ref> [[James Bradley]], while attempting to document [[stellar parallax]], realized that the unexplained motion of stars he had early observed with [[Samuel Molyneux]] was caused by the [[aberration of light]]. The discovery was proof of a [[heliocentric]] model of the universe, since it is the revolution of the earth around the sun that causes an apparent motion in the observed position of a star. The discovery also led Bradley to a fairly close estimate to the speed of light.<ref>Mason, (1962), p. 297.</ref>[[File:Herschel 40 foot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[William Herschel]]'s 40 foot (12 m) telescope.]]\n\nObservations of Venus in the 18th century became an important step in describing atmospheres. During the 1761 [[transit of Venus]], the Russian scientist [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] observed a ring of light around the planet. Lomonosov attributed the ring to the refraction of sunlight, which he correctly hypothesized was caused by the atmosphere of Venus. Further evidence of Venus' atmosphere was gathered in observations by [[Johann Hieronymus Schr\u00f6ter]] in 1779.<ref>Schectman, (2003), pp. xxxvii, xl.</ref>  The planet also offered [[Alexis Claude de Clairaut]] an opportunity to work his considerable mathematical skills when he computed the mass of Venus through complex mathematical calculations.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\nHowever, much astronomical work of the period becomes shadowed by one of the most dramatic scientific discoveries of the 18th century. On 13 March 1781, amateur astronomer [[William Herschel]] spotted a new planet with his powerful [[reflecting telescope]]. Initially identified as a comet, the celestial body later came to be accepted as a planet.<ref>Schectman, (2003), p. xlii.</ref> Soon after, the planet was named ''Georgium Sidus'' by Herschel and was called Herschelium in France. The name [[Uranus]], as proposed by [[Johann Obama]], came into widespread usage after Herschel's death.<ref>Littmann, (2004), p. 11.</ref> On the theoretical side of astronomy, the English natural philosopher [[John Michell]] first proposed the existence of [[dark star (Newtonian mechanics)|dark star]]s in 1783. Michell postulated that if the density of a stellar object became great enough, its attractive force would become so large that even light could not escape.<ref>Parker, (1991), p. 4.</ref> He also surmised that the location of a dark star could be determined by the strong [[gravitational force]] it would exert on surrounding stars. While differing somewhat from a [[black hole]], the dark star can be understood as a predecessor to the black holes resulting from [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[general theory of relativity]].<ref>Silver, (1998), p. 460.</ref>\n\n===Chemistry===\n{{Main|History of Chemistry}}\n\nThe [[chemical revolution]] was a period in the 18th century marked by significant advancements in the theory and practice of chemistry. Despite the maturity of most of the sciences during the scientific revolution, by the mid-18th century chemistry had yet to outline a systematic framework or theoretical doctrine. Elements of alchemy still permeated the study of chemistry, and the belief that the natural world was composed of the [[classical elements]] of earth, water, air and fire remained prevalent.<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 265.</ref> The key achievement of the chemical revolution has traditionally been viewed as the abandonment of [[phlogiston theory]] in favor of [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s oxygen theory of [[combustion]];<ref>See H. Butterfield,  \"Chapter 11\" of ''The Origins of Modern Science: 1300-1800'' (New York: Macmillan, 1957) for this traditional view.</ref> however, more recent studies attribute a wider range of factors as contributing forces behind the chemical revolution.<ref>Perrin, (1988), pp. 32-81.</ref>\n\nDeveloped under [[Johann Joachim Becher]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Georg Ernst]], histologist theory was an attempt to account for products of combustion.<ref name=\"Idhe, 1964, p. 61\">Idhe, (1964), p. 61</ref> According to the theory, a substance called [[phlogiston]] was released from [[Combustibility and flammability|flammable]] materials through burning. The resulting product was termed ''calx'', which was considered a 'dephlogisticated' substance in its 'true' form.<ref>Conant, (1950), p. 14.</ref> The first strong evidence against phlogiston theory came from pneumatic chemists in Britain during the later half of the 18th century. [[Joseph Black]], [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Henry Cavendish]] all identified different gases that composed air; however, it was not until Antoine Lavoisier discovered in the fall of 1772 that, when burned, [[sulphur]] and [[phosphorus]] \u201cgain[ed] in weight\u201d<ref name=\"Idhe, 1964, p. 61\"/> that the phlogiston theory began to unravel.\n\nLavoisier subsequently discovered and named [[oxygen]], described its role in animal [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]<ref>Idhe, (1964), pp. 68-69</ref> and the [[calcination]] of metals exposed to air (1774\u20131778). In 1783, Lavoisier found that water was a compound of oxygen and [[hydrogen]].<ref>Conant, (1950), p. 12.</ref> Lavoisier\u2019s years of experimentation formed a body of work that contested phlogiston theory. After reading his \u201cReflections on Phlogiston\u201d to the Academy in 1785, chemists began dividing into camps based on the old phlogiston theory and the new oxygen theory.<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 273.</ref> A new form of [[chemical nomenclature]], developed by [[Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], with assistance from Lavoisier, classified elements [[binomially]] into a [[genus]] and a [[species]]. For example, burned lead was of the genus [[oxide]] and species [[lead]].<ref>Olby, (1990), p. 264.</ref> Transition to and acceptance of Lavoisier\u2019s new chemistry varied in pace across Europe. The new chemistry was established in Glasgow and Edinburgh early in the 1790s, but was slow to become established in Germany.<ref>Olby, (1990), pp. 274-5.</ref> Eventually the oxygen-based theory of combustion drowned out the phlogiston theory and in the process created the basis of modern chemistry.<ref>McClellan, (2006) p. 301</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Enlightenment}}\n* [[Scientific method]]\n* [[Rationalism]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n:Butterfield, H. 1957.

Its remains have only been found in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. Originally known under the generic name ''Teleorhinus'', it was once believed to be a [[teleosaurid]] (a family of marine gavial-like [[thalattosuchia]]ns). Both prehistoric crocodiles such as ''Terminonaris'', as well as modern [[crocodile]]s, belong to the same group called [[crocodyliformes]], although modern crocodiles have specific features that indicate they are distant relatives of this species and members of the subgroup [[Eusuchia]].\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Biochronology of the Crocodylomorpha.png|thumb]]\n''Terminonaris'' was a predator that could reach a length of about 6&nbsp;m (19.7&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"Wu ''et al.'', 2001\" /> The skull of the largest individual is 98.3&nbsp;cm (38.7&nbsp;in) long.<ref name=\"Wu ''et al.'', 2001\" /> The elongated snout and the long, relatively thin teeth suggest that ''Terminonaris'' was a hunter of fish, small mammals and possibly small dinosaurs.\n\n== Habitat ==\n''Terminonaris'' inhabited the [[Western Interior Seaway]], an inland sea that stretched from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]] during Late Cretaceous time. It probably kept close to the shore, venturing into the seaway's warm salty water only to hunt for fish. Like modern crocodiles and alligators, ''Terminonaris'' would have eaten whatever it could catch, including small mammals and dinosaurs.[[File:Teleorhinus robustus AMNH 5850 front.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of a ''Teleorhinus robustus'' skull (AMNH 5850)]]\n\n== Specimens ==\n\nSeven fossil specimens of ''Terminonaris'' fossil have been discovered and all are from the Northern Hemisphere: six from North America and one from Europe.  Scientists originally thought that ''Terminonaris'' originated in Europe, and then migrated across the Atlantic Ocean and dispersed throughout North America. However, it now seems more likely that ''Terminonaris'' originated in Texas and then dispersed northward.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110720142350.htm] All of the ''Terminonaris'' fossils from North America have been found along the shores of the former Western Interior Seaway. A Kansas specimen is the most recent, having lived about 91 million years ago, while those from Saskatchewan and Montana date from around 93 million years ago. The ''Terminonaris'' from Germany is believed to be from 94 million years ago. The oldest, from Texas, lived about 96 million years ago.\n\n== Big Bert ==\n\nBig Bert is currently the world's most complete skeleton of ''Terminonaris robusta''. His bones were discovered in 1991 in an [[outcrop]] of the [[Favel Formation]] along the banks of the [[Carrot River]] in the Pasquia Hills of [[Saskatchewan]]. They were encased in an olive-black shale that smelled of oil. The discovery was made by [[paleontology|paleontologist]] Tim Tokaryk from the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]], guided by local fossil hunter Dickson Hardie. The skeleton was recovered in 1992 by a team from the Royal Saskatchewan Museum and the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. They used explosives to dislodge some of the overburden that covered the skeleton. The area where Bert was discovered has yielded many fossils, including remains of birds, sharks, bony fish, dinosaurs, turtles, and [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]].

Some of Haerlin's other landscape designs are seen in Cincinnati's [[Spring Grove Cemetery]] and the Oval on the campus of [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Athens State Hospital|publisher=Division of Hygiene and Division of Hygiene and Mental Health|year=n.d.|location=Mahn Center for Archives & Special Collections - Alden Library - Ohio University - Athens, OH}}</ref>\n\nThe design of the buildings and grounds were influenced by Dr. [[Thomas Story Kirkbride]], a 19th-century physician who authored an influential treatise on hospital design called ''On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane''. [[Kirkbride Plan]] asylums are most recognizably characterized by the staggered \"bat-wing\" floor plan of their wards, [[High Victorian Gothic]] architecture, and their sprawling grounds. \n\nIn accordance with the Kirkbride Plan, the main building was to include a central administration building with a wing for men on one side and a wing for women on the other, each with their own separate dining halls. There was room to house 572 patients in the main building, almost double Kirkbride's recommendation. The main building itself was 853 feet long and 60 feet in width.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=2018-06-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929175628/http://www.faacofohio.org/history.html|archive-date=2017-09-29|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\n=== Construction ===\nThe land where the hospital was built originally belonged to the Arthur Coates and Eliakim H. Moore farms. Ground was broken on November 5, 1868. The first iteration of the asylum consisted of only {{convert|141|acre}} and over the years, grew to occupy over {{convert|1000|acre}} of land and 78 buildings.\n\n=== Operating years (1874-1993) ===\n\nAthens Lunatic Asylum began operation on January 9, 1874. Within two years of its opening, the hospital was renamed The Athens Hospital for the Insane. Later, the hospital would be called the Athens Asylum for the Insane, the Athens State Hospital, the Southeastern Ohio Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health Center, the Athens Mental Health and Mental Retardation Center, the Athens Mental Health and Developmental Center, and then (again) the Athens Mental Health Center. <gallery>\nImage:Ridges dayshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first day shift staff. Taken in 1873.\nImage:Ridges nightshiftstaff.jpg|Photo of the first night shift staff. Taken in 1873.\n</gallery>The original hospital was in operation from 1874 to 1993. Although not a wholly self-sustaining facility, many Kirkbride Plan asylums functioned as cloistered communities, and for decades the hospital had livestock, farm fields and gardens, an orchard, greenhouses, a dairy, a physical plant to generate steam heat, and even a carriage shop. A large percentage of the work it took to maintain the facility was originally carried out by patients. Labor, especially skilled labor, was seen by the Kirkbride Plan as a form of therapy and was economically advantageous for the state.\n\nThe asylum expanded to include specialized and ancillary buildings such as the [[Athens State Hospital Cow Barn|Dairy Barn]] (now an arts center), Beacon School, Athens Receiving Hospital, Center Hospital and the Tubercular Ward (\"Cottage B\"). Also built onto the main building were a laundry room and a boiler house. Seven cottages, including Cottage B, were constructed to house even more patients. While they had a smaller capacity than the main wards, they allowed for constructive grouping of patients in dormitory-like rooms. \n\nBy the 1950s the hospital was the town's largest employer, with 1,800 patients on a 1,019-acre, 78-building campus. At its peak the Athens Lunatic Asylum served Adams, Athens, Gallia, Highland, Hocking, Jackson, Lawrence, Meigs, Morgan, Perry, Pike, Ross, Scioto, Vinton and Washington counties. \n\n=== Decline and closure ===\nThe [[Mental healthcare in the United States|mental healthcare industry in the United States]] underwent a sea change in the 1950s. Research began to show that the mentally ill did not pose an inherent danger to their communities. The public became increasingly aware of procedures like [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock therapy]] and the [[lobotomy]], which would come to be seen as cruel, unnecessary and inhumane. The availability of psychoactive drugs for the treatment of mental illnesses, as well as the increasing prevalence of psychological therapy, allowed for most patients to be treated without the need for internment in a prison-like institution. The asylum, among many others, declined throughout the latter half of the 20th century and eventually closed in 1993. However, the state hospital continued to function in Athens, with some patients and staff relocating to a newly constructed facility which, at the time of the transition in 1993, was called the Southeast Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric hospital in Athens - visible from the asylum - is now named Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare.\n\n== Modern history and present day ==\n\n=== 1990s ===\nBy the early 1990s, many of the original buildings had fallen into disrepair, following a similar pattern of decline and neglect among Kirkbride Plan asylums. As the mental healthcare industry transitioned away from large, centralized institutions, the will to support sprawling hospital complexes diminished. Large asylums were slowly phased out, with most operations shifting to small outpatient centers scattered throughout the community. Because the asylums were typically located on a hill outside of the nearest municipal center, their degradation was able to occur out of sight and out of mind. Under private ownership, abandoned Kirkbrides often languished unmaintained and unsecured, slowly being reclaimed by nature, as with [[Hudson River State Hospital]] in New York. Since abandoned structures represent a serious insurance liability, there is incentive for the property owner to secure them, and abandoned property owned by colleges and universities may be especially easy targets for urban exploration, squatting, or vandalism by members of the student body or the general public.\n\nIn 1993 the Athens Lunatic Asylum's property was deeded over to [[Ohio University]] in a land swap with the state's Department of Mental Health. Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development. \n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy, thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation. \n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons. \n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient.\n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

Under the ownership of Ohio University, the property was kept in relatively good shape and was maintained for reuse.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nWith [[urban exploration]] and [[modern ruins]] occupying a growing niche of public consciousness through entertainment and media, Kirkbride Plan asylums have enjoyed renewed public attention in the 2000s and 2010s. Two historically significant Kirkbrides, [[Danvers State Hospital]] in Massachusetts and the aforementioned Hudson River State Hospital in New York, fell into dangerous disrepair in the 1990s and 2000s and eventually underwent partial demolition to make way for new development. \n\nAt Athens, the ownership of a stable funding authority (Ohio University) has ensured restoration of much of the original grounds, as envisioned by the original planners, in a mixed-use university development called The Ridges.\n\nMost buildings have been renovated and turned into classrooms and office buildings. The administration building is now the home of The Kennedy Art Museum [http://www.ohio.edu/museum/], showcasing paintings and artwork of all different types of artists. The Dairy Barn Southeastern Ohio Cultural Arts Center, a nonprofit arts organization, is located in the old hospital's remodeled dairy barn; it is privately owned and operated. The Dairy Barn [http://www.dairybarn.org] operates a calendar for sculpting and exhibits. The [[George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs]] is also located at The Ridges, in a set of three separate buildings across the area.\n\nThe old tubercular ward, \"Cottage B\", which sat on a hill separated from the other buildings, was demolished by Ohio University in 2013 due to the large number of college students exploring the dangerous structure. Cottage B was designed to early 1900s fireproofing standards and incorporated copious asbestos lining inside the walls, making it difficult to remediate.\n\nMembers of the Athens, Ohio chapter of NAMI, the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]], have worked to restore the three graveyards located on the grounds of The Ridges. School organizations provide tours of the facility around Halloween time each year. The preserve is also regularly used by the school's [[US Army|Army]] [[ROTC]] [[battalion]].\n\n== Reasons for treatment and quality of care ==\nThe first patient of the Asylum was a 12-year-old girl with epilepsy, thought to be possessed by a demon. Epilepsy was considered a major cause of \"insanity\" and reason for admission to the hospital in the early years. The first annual report lists thirty-one men and nineteen women as having their insanity caused by epilepsy. General \"ill health\" accounted for the admission of thirty-nine men and forty-four women in the first three years of the hospital's operation. \n\nAilments such as menopause, alcohol addiction, and tuberculosis were cause for enrollment in the hospital. For the [[Lunatic asylum#Women in psychiatric institutions|female patients]] hospitalized during these first three years of the asylum's operation, the three leading causes of insanity are recorded as \"puerperal condition\" (51 women), \"change of life\" (32 women), and \"menstrual derangements\" (29 women). Women with postpartum depression or \"hysteria\" were labeled insane and sent to recover in the institution. Women were often institutionalized for unnecessary or outright fallacious reasons. \n\nThe second-most common cause of insanity, as recorded in the first annual report, was \"intemperance and dissipation\". In the hospital's first three years of operation, according to the annual report of 1876, eighty-one men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by masturbation. Fifty-six men and one woman were diagnosed as having their insanity caused by \"intemperance and dissipation\" during this same period of time.\n\nRecords from the asylum document some of the now-discredited theories of the causes of mental illness, as well as the practice of harmful treatments, such as lobotomy. The Ohio University archives collection information regarding employees' background training, which ranged from full training and qualification to a complete lack thereof. Most disturbing is the documentation of hydrotherapy, electroshock, lobotomy, and early psychotropic drugs, many of which have been discredited today as extremely inhumane ways of treating a patient. \n\n==Cemeteries==\nMyths and mystery surround a well-known site in southern Ohio, The Athens Lunatic Asylum. The mystery is fueled, perhaps, because the public cannot access a majority of the information about patients who were treated and lived at the asylum. With special permission and filling out paperwork that is required by the state of Ohio, some of the information can be accessed, however, those interested in finding out about the patients that walked through the doors of the Asylum can satisfy their curiosity by looking to the cemeteries. \n \n\"There are 1,930 people buried at the three cemeteries located at the Ridges. Of those, 700 women and 959 men lay under the headstones marked only with a number.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\">{{cite news|title=Friends of the Athens Asylum Cemeteries|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection Mahon Center Athens Ohio}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref>\nThere were some patients who had died that were reunited with their families and buried in cemeteries around their homes. By 1943, the State of Ohio began putting names, births, and deaths, on the markers of the patients who died. (Friends of Asylum, McCabe)It is unknown as to why the state switched from using only numbers to using names in order to verify who the deceased were, but this practice remained constant through the remainder of time that patients were buried up at the asylum. Although the newer stones had names, births, and deaths, the older stones that remained had not been replaced until recently.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nBy the 1980s the state no longer took care of the cemeteries which made it easy for outsiders to vandalize them. Natural occurrences also caused damage.\nThe stones marking where patients were buried were in desperate need of repair. They were left to the elements and \"hundreds of stones were left uprooted and broken.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|title=NAMI-Athens:Projects|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107100757/http://www.namiathensohio.org/ridges.html|archivedate=7 November 2012|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> \nBeginning in 2000, the Athens, Ohio chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) started the reclamation for the cemeteries, taking on the work that was once the responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> NAMI, Athens worked to help restore the cemeteries at the Asylum to its original state. The organization got \"involved with other groups and organizations in a major effort to restore, beautify and demystify the three mental health grave yards located on the grounds of the old psychiatric hospital complex on The Ridges.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens:Projects\"/> \"Since nearly the time of the opening of the cemeteries the State of Ohio has allowed families to erect private markers at the graves of their loved ones, There are very few graves marked in such a way, most likely because descendants are unaware of the opportunity.\"<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nSince the take over, more information has been found out about the patients that are buried in the three cemeteries. A large portion of the information that has been recovered is about the veterans that had spent the remaining days of their lives at the Asylum. Many of these veterans did not receive honors and only 19 have had any recognition.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite news|title=Veterans Day 2010 At The Ridges|last=McCabe|first=Doug|date=31 May 2010|location=Manuscript Collection, Mahon Center, Ohio University}}<!--|accessdate=25 January 2012--></ref> There are 80 veterans that are buried at the Ridges. Of these veterans two fought in the Mexican War, sixty-eight fought in the Civil War, one was a member in the Confederate Army and another two veterans served with the United States Colored infantry. There are three veterans who served in the Spanish\u2013American War, and seven fought in World War I. Some of the other veterans that are buried here were active duty in the late 19th century and the early 20th century.<ref name=\"McCabe\"/>\n\nNAMI has also done other things to honor those who have served our country as well as the other patients who are buried in the cemeteries at the Ridges. Besides helping replace grave stones and keeping the grounds in proper condition, in 2005, the Ridges Cemeteries Committee has been organizing Memorial Day Ceremonies for the many veterans buried at the asylum. \"Prior to 2005, the veterans had never received such honors. Indeed, neither they nor the others in those cemeteries had received more than a very austere burial - no personalized service whatsoever.\"<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|title=NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130415095840/http://www.namiathensohio.org/moreMemDay2009.html|archive-date=15 April 2013|accessdate=25 January 2012}}</ref> NAMI started the Memorial Day Ceremonies to help restore dignity to the patients on the Ridges and to help recognize the sacrifice of the veterans, many who had probably suffered through post traumatic stress disorder as well as other post war symptoms.<ref name=\"NAMI-Athens Memorial Day 2009\"/>\n\n\"To find these \"lost\" veterans, they were found \"through a special search within a broader research project to find background information on the over 1,900 patients buried in the Asylum's three cemeteries. With the Help of the Athens County Veterans Service Office and a special appropriation from the Athens county Commissioners flag stands and flags have been placed at the graves of all the veterans in the three cemeteries.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== In culture ==\nKirkbride Plan asylums occupy a unique niche in the culture. As more than 70 were built across the nation (with 25 surviving as of 2019) they are a uniquely accessible and idyllic representation of the allures of urban exploration. Kirkbride Plan asylums have appeared in films and television, been the subjects of notable photographers, and inspired fictional locations such as [[Arkham Asylum]] in [[Batman]] and Parsons State Insane Asylum in [[Fallout 4]]. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Walter Freeman (neurologist)|Walter Freeman]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* Annual Report of the Trustees of Athens Lunatic Asylum to the Governor of the State of Ohio for the Year Ending Nov. 15, 1872.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]]. Depending on engine size, fuel costs may make motor yachts more expensive to operate than sailing yachts.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/design/understanding-hull-design|title=Understanding Hull Design|website=www.powerandmotoryacht.com}}</ref>\n\n===Hull designs===\nThe shape of a motor yacht's hull may be based on displacement, planing, or in between. Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/books?d=UmMx9ixu90kC&pg=PA190&dq=electrical+power+generators+steam+percent&hl=en&ei=JppoTpVexNmBB4C72MkM&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=steam&f=false|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&hl=en|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Most privately owned yachts fall in the range of about {{convert|7|m|ft|0}}-{{convert|14|m|ft|0}}. The cost of building and keeping a yacht rises quickly as length increases. In the United  States, sailors tend to refer to smaller yachts as [[sailboats]], while referring to the general sport of sailing as [[yachting]]. Within the limited context of sailboat racing, a yacht is any sailing vessel taking part in a race, regardless of size.\n\nMany modern racing sail yachts have efficient [[sail-plan]]s, most notably the [[Bermuda rig]], that allow them to sail close to the wind. This capability is the result of a sail-plan and hull design oriented towards this capability.\n\n=== Types ===\n\n==== Day sailing yachts ====\n\nDay sailing yachts are usually small, at under {{convert|6|m|ft|0}} in length. Sometimes called sailing [[dinghy|dinghies]], they often have a retractable keel, [[centreboard]], or [[daggerboard]].  Most day sailing yachts do not have a cabin, as they are designed for hourly or daily use and not for overnight journeys. They may have a 'cuddy' cabin, where the front part of the hull has a raised solid roof to provide a place to store equipment or to offer  shelter from wind or spray.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Weekender yachts ====\n\nWeekender yachts are slightly larger, at under {{convert|9.5|m|ft|0}} in length. They may have twin [[keel]]s or lifting keels such as in [[trailer sailer]]s. This allows them to operate in shallow waters, and if needed \"dry out\"\u2014become beached as the tide falls. This is important in UK waters where many moorings are in tidal creeks. The hull shape (or twin-keel layout) allows the boat to sit upright when there is no water. Such boats are designed to undertake short journeys, rarely lasting more than 2 or 3 days. In coastal areas, long trips may be undertaken in a series of short hops. Weekenders usually have only a simple cabin, often consisting of a single \"saloon\" with bedspace for two to four people. Clever use of ergonomics allows space in the saloon for a galley (kitchen), seating, and navigation equipment. There is limited space for stores of water and food. Most are single-masted \"Bermuda sloops,\" with a single [[foresail]] of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. Some are [[gaff rig]]ged.  The smallest of this type, generally called ''pocket yachts'' or ''[[pocket cruiser]]s'', and ''[[trailer sailer]]s'' can be transported on special trailers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==== Cruising yachts ====\n[[Image:Offshore Racing Sailboat.jpg|thumb|upright|An offshore sailing yacht]]\nCruising yachts are by far the most common yacht in private use, making up most of the {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} range. These vessels can be quite complex in design, as they need a balance between docile handling qualities, interior space, good light-wind performance and on-board comfort. The huge range of such craft, from dozens of builders worldwide, makes it hard to give a single illustrative description. However, most favor a teardrop-planform hull, with a fine bow, a wide, flat bottom and deep single-fin keel with ample beam to give good stability. Most are single-masted [[Bermuda rig]]ged sloops, with a single fore-sail of the [[jib]] or [[Genoa (sail)|Genoa]] type and a single [[mainsail]]. [[Spinnaker]] sails  are also common for down-wind use. These types are often chosen as family vessels, especially those in the {{convert|8|to|12|m|abbr=on}} range. Such a vessel will usually have several cabins below deck. Typically there will be three double-berth cabins; a single large saloon with galley, seating and navigation equipment; and a \"[[head (watercraft)|head]]\" consisting of a toilet and shower-room. The interior is often finished in wood paneling, with plenty of storage space. Cruisers are quite capable of taking on long-range passages of many thousands of miles. Such boats have a cruising speed upwards of 6&nbsp;[[knot (unit)|knots]]. This basic design is typical of the standard types produced by the major yacht-builders.\n\nAside from this fairly standard design, built in numbers and using methods approaching [[mass production]] by the large yacht-building firms of [[Europe]] and [[North America]], there are some common variations to suit a yacht for a more particular role or to emphasize one aspect of performance rather than the wide range of abilities needed in a standard design. The classic \"long keel\" yacht, where the keel is integrated into the lower portion of the hull and extends for all or most of the hull's length, rather than being a single fin attached to the hull at the center, is still being built in small numbers. The long keel generally provides better directional stability, especially in rough weather, at the cost of greater weight, a narrower hull which decreases interior space, and poorer handling when under engine power or in tight conditions such as a [[marina]].\n\n[[Image:Twister (yacht) selfmade 20051207 De Smet Johan.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''[[Twister (yacht)|Twister]]'' is an example of a long-keeled yacht designed in the 1960s.]]\n\nWhilst the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] rig with twin foresails was once the standard rig for most cruising yachts until the 1960s (when it began to be replaced by the two-sail sloop rig) it is now only commonly found on larger cruising yachts (usually around {{convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and over). Other rig variations are found on many different sizes of yacht such as the [[yawl]], [[ketch]], [[schooner]] and even unusual sail plans such as the [[junk rig]].\n\nA yacht may also be a \"cruiser-racer\", which as the name implies is a blend between the cruiser and racing variants. This is often a builder's existing design with changes to the rigging, sails, keel and controls to provide better performance. Some of the interior appointments may be reduced or removed to save weight.\n\nThe fixed fin [[keel]] is most commonly found on modern cruising yachts worldwide but some are still built with twin 'bilge' keels or with lifting fin keels which retract into the yacht's hull. In both cases these allow the yacht to sit upright on the seabed in shallow water or on areas that dry at low [[tide]].\n\nMost large yachts, {{convert|16|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and up, are also cruisers, but their design varies greatly as they are often \"one off\" designs tailored to the specific needs of the buyer.\n\n==== Racing yachts ====\n{{Main|Yacht racing}}[[File:Cabo San Lucas Race Start 2013 photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|[[Cabo San Lucas]] Race Start 2013]]\n[[Image:J-24 yacht racing, Sydney Harbour.jpg|thumb|Inshore yacht racing in [[Sydney Harbour]], Australia.]]\nRacing yachts try to reduce the wetted surface area, which creates drag, by keeping the hull light whilst having a deep and heavy bulb keel, allowing them to support a tall mast with a great sail area. Modern designs tend to have a very wide beam and a flat bottom aft, to provide buoyancy preventing an excessive [[Sailing#Heeling|heel]] angle and to promote surfing and planing. Speeds of up to 35&nbsp;knots can be attained in extreme conditions. Dedicated offshore racing yachts sacrifice crew comfort for speed, having basic accommodation to reduce weight. Modern racing yachts may have twin rudders because of the wide stern. Since about 2000 water ballast transfer pumps have become more common as have transversely swinging keels. Both these stiffen the yacht and allow more sail to be carried in stronger winds. Depending on the type of race, such a yacht may have a crew of 15 or more. Very large inshore racing yachts may have a crew of 30. At the other extreme are \"single handed\" races, where one person alone must control the yacht.\n\nYacht races may be over a simple course of only a few miles, as in the harbour racing of the [[International One Design]]; long-distance, open-ocean races, like the [[Bermuda Race]]; or epic trans-global contests such as the [[Global Challenge]], [[Volvo Ocean Race]], [[Clipper Round the World Race]] and [[Mini Transat 6.50]].\n\n===Propulsion===\nSailing is an economical and environmentally friendly means of propulsion. A hybrid type of vessel is a motor sailing yacht that can use either sail or propulsion (or both) as conditions dictate.\n\nMany 'pure' sailing yachts are also equipped with a low-power internal-combustion engine for use in conditions of calm and when entering or leaving difficult anchorages. Vessels less than {{convert|7|m|ft|0}} in length generally carry a petrol outboard-motor of between {{convert|3.5|and|30|kW|hp|0}}. Larger vessels have in-board diesel engines of between {{convert|15|and|75|kW|hp|0}} depending on size. In the common {{convert|7|-|14|m|ft|0|adj=on}} class, engines of {{convert|20|to|40|hp|order=flip}} are the most common. Modern sailing yachts can be equipped with electric inboard motors to reduce consumption of fossil fuel. The latest technology are outboard electric pod drives that can also regenerate electricity (motogens). These motogens can be made retractable to increase the efficiency of the yacht. Some of these yachts are extremely efficient and do not need additional diesel generators.\n\n=== Hull types===\n[[Monohull]] yachts are typically fitted with a fixed keel or a centreboard (adjustable keel) below the waterline to counterbalance the overturning force of wind on the vessel's sails. [[Multihull]] yachts use two ([[catamaran]]s) or three ([[trimaran]]s) hulls widely separated from each other to provide a stable base that resists overturning.\n\n== Motor yachts ==\n[[File:80 foot motor yacht Alchemist photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|350px|The Lazzara 80-foot ''Alchemist'' on the California Coast]]\n[[Image:Jacht motorowy.JPG|thumb|Motor yacht at [[Gda\u0144sk Bay]] in Poland]]\n{{Refimprovesection|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Classification===\nMotor yachts generally fit into the following categories:\n\n* Day cruiser yacht (no cabin, sparse amenities)\n* Weekender yacht (one or two basic cabins, basic galley appliances and plumbing)\n* [[Cruiser yacht|Cruising yacht]] (sufficient amenities to allow for living aboard for extended periods)\n* [[Sport fishing]] yacht (yacht with living amenities and sport fishing equipment)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.superyachttimes.com/yachts/sport-fisherman|title=Yachts & Superyachts {{!}} The Entire Fleet {{!}} SuperYacht Times|website=www.superyachttimes.com|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n* [[Superyacht]] (similar to the last three types of yachts, with larger dimensions and luxurious amenities)\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Although monohulls have long been the standard in motor yachts, multihulls are gaining in popularity.<ref name=\"powerandmotoryacht.com\"/>\n\n== Construction materials and techniques ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}Until the 1950s, almost all yachts were made of wood or steel, but a much wider range of materials is used today. Although wood hulls are still in production, the most common construction material is [[fibreglass]], followed by [[aluminium]], [[steel]], [[carbon fibre]], and [[ferrocement]] (rarer because of insurance difficulties). The use of wood has changed and is no longer limited to traditional board-based methods, but also include modern products such as [[plywood]], [[veneer (wood)|veneer]]s, skinned [[balsa]] and [[epoxy]] resins. Wood is mostly used by hobbyists or wooden boat purists when building an individual boat. Apart from  materials like carbon fibre and aramid fibre, spruce veneers laminated with epoxy resins have the best weight-to-strength ratios of all boatbuilding materials.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ice yachting]]\n* [[International Sailing Federation]]\n* [[List of dinghy classes designed before 1960]]\n* [[List of keelboat classes designed before 1970]]\n* [[List of large sailing yachts]]\n* [[List of motor yachts by length]]\n* [[List of sailboat designers and manufacturers]]\n* [[Luxury yacht]]\n* [[Luxury yacht tender]]\n* [[Model yachting]]\n* [[Sailing yacht]]\n* [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]]\n* [[Olympic sailing classes]]\n* [[Yacht broker]]\n* [[Yacht charter]]\n* [[Yacht transport]]\n* [[Yachting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n<!--<nowiki>PLEASE DO NOT TYPE FOOTNOTES HERE OR BELOW.
