After negotiations, the Netherlands signed the [[New York Agreement]] with Indonesia on 15 August 1962, relinquishing control of Western New Guinea to the United Nations.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]] became fully independent as Indonesia in December 1949, the Dutch retained sovereignty over the western part of the island of [[New Guinea]] and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. The Dutch and West Papuan leaders argued that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the West Papuans were ethnically and geographically separated from Indonesians, had always been administrated separately, and that the West Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 282</ref> From its independence in 1949 until 1961, Indonesia attempted to gain control of Western New Guinea through the United Nations without success. Since the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], Indonesian nationalists had regarded Western New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the Indonesian state.<ref>Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, p. 45</ref> They also contended that [[Western New Guinea]] (Irian Barat) belonged to Indonesia and was being illegally occupied by the Dutch.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\">{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 2011 |title=Operation Trikora \u2013 Indonesia's Takeover of West New Guinea |journal=Pathfinder: Air Power Development Centre Bulletin |volume= |issue=150 |pages=1\u20132 |doi= |url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/publications/Details/443/150-Operation-TRIKORA---Indonesias-Takeover-of-West-New-Guinea.aspx |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\">{{cite journal |last1=Platje |first1=Wies |year=2001 |title=Dutch Sigint and the Conflict with Indonesia 1950\u201362|journal=Intelligence and National Security |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=285\u2013312 |doi= 10.1080/714002840}}</ref>\n\nSince 1954, Indonesia had sporadically launched military raids into Western New Guinea. Following the failure of negotiations at the [[United Nations]], the president of Indonesia, [[Sukarno]], escalated pressure on the Netherlands by nationalising Dutch-owned businesses and estates and repatriating Dutch nationals. These actions increased tensions between Indonesia and the Netherlands led to a sharp reduction in trade between the two countries. Following a sustained period of harassment of Dutch diplomats in Indonesia, Indonesia formally severed ties with the Netherlands in August 1960. Indonesia also increased its military pressure on Dutch New Guinea by purchasing weapons from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Over the following years, the Sukarno government would become dependent on Soviet military support.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 402\">J.D. Legge, 402</ref>\n\nOn 19 December 1961, Sukarno decreed the establishment of the People's Triple Command or ''Tri Komando Rakyat'' (Trikora) in order to annex what Indonesia called [[West Irian]] by 1 January 1963. Trikora's operational command was to be called the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (''Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat'') with Major-General [[Suharto]] (the future President of Indonesia) serving as its commander. In preparation for the planned invasion, the Mandala command began making land, air, and sea incursions into West Irian.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"Bilveer Singh, p.86\">Bilveer Singh, ''West Irian and the Suharto Presidency'', p.86</ref> As a result, Indonesia began a policy of confronting the Dutch over control of Western New Guinea.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 402\"/> Sukarno also embarked on a policy of \"progressive mobilization\" to prepare the nation to carry out his commands.<ref>Soedjati Djiwandono, p. 131</ref>\n\nWhile the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia sided with the Netherlands' claims to Western New Guinea and were opposed to Indonesian expansionism, they were unwilling to commit military support to the Dutch. The Netherlands was unable to find sufficient international support for its New Guinea policy. By contrast, Sukarno was able to muster the support of the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In response to Indonesian claims, the Netherlands to sped up the process of implementing West Papuan self-rule from 1959 onward. These measures included the establishment of a legislative New Guinea Council in 1960, establishing hospitals, completion of a shipyard in [[Manokwari]], development of agricultural research sites and plantations; and the creation of the [[Papuan Volunteer Corps]] to defend the territory.<ref>Wies Platje, 297\u2013299</ref><ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 403\">J.D. Legge, 403</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\n=== Military ===\n\nIndonesia began seeking weapons from abroad in response to the conflict with the Netherlands. Having failed to secure anything from the United States, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]] went to [[Moscow]] in December 1960 to negotiate what eventually turned out to be a US$2.5 Billion arms package with the Soviet government. The subsequent deliveries that arose from this deal led the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to boast that Indonesia had the strongest air force in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe [[United States]] did not support the surrender of West Irian to Indonesia, since the [[Bureau of European Affairs]] considered it an act of trading one occupying power for another. However, in April 1961, Robert Komer and McGeorge Bundy began to prepare plans for the United Nations to give the impression that surrender to Indonesia was legal. Although reluctantly, President John F. Kennedy finally supported these plans, fearing that, without U.S support, the Indonesians would become further entrenched into the Soviet-bloc.\n\nIndonesia bought various kinds of military equipment, including 41 [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] and nine [[Mil Mi-6|Mi-6]] helicopters, 30 [[MiG-15]], 49 [[MiG-17]], ten [[MiG-19]] and 20 [[MiG-21]] fighter jets, 12 [[Whiskey-class submarine|Whiskey]]-class submarines, 12 [[Komar-class missile boat|Komar-class]] missile boats, and one ex-Soviet Navy [[Sverdlov-class cruiser]] which was renamed the [[KRI Irian]]). Of the types of bombers, there were 22 [[Ilyushin Il-28]] light bombers, 14 [[TU-16 Badger|TU-16]] long-range medium bombers, and 12 maritime versions of TU-16 aircraft equipped to launch the [[AS-1 Kennel]] [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship missiles]]. Of the types of transport aircraft, there were 26 [[Ilyushin Il-14|IL-14]] and AQvia-14 light transport aircraft, six [[Antonov An-12]] heavy transports, and ten [[C-130 Hercules]] tactical transport aircraft.<ref name=\"Sibero\">{{cite news\u00a0| last = Sibero\u00a0| first = Tarigan\u00a0| title = Heroic Story of Seizing West Irian (1)\u00a0| publisher = TNI\u00a0| date = May 3, 2006 | url = http://www.tni.mil.id/news.php?q=dtl&id=113012006111078 }}</ref>\n\n=== Airbases ===\nTo achieve air superiority, the first preparations undertaken by the [[Indonesian Air Force|AURI]] were to repair war-damaged airbases, which would be used for infiltration operations and normal operations on the West Irian mainland. [[Air Base|Air bases]] and [[Landing Strip|landing strips]] which were common along the borders of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[West Irian]], were relics of [[Empire of Japan|imperial Japanese]] presence. Such airbases and landing strips were last used in 1945, and had since fallen into disrepair.\n\n===Soviet involvement===\nSoviet support of Indonesia played a crucial role in ending the conflict over New Guinea. Due to the support of Soviet submarines and bombers, Indonesian military forces could confidently launch an attack on Dutch troops. In response to Soviet presence, the United States put pressure on the Netherlands to relinquish control of West Papua. At the height of the Cold War, it was strategically critical that Indonesia remain outside the U.S.S.R's sphere of influence, which made the U.S willing to take action to ensure a neutral or friendly relationship with Indonesia. By enforcing the transfer of New Guinea, the United States could keep the regime of Sukarno friendly, despite not supporting the Netherlands which eventually gave way to American pressure and the threat of an attack on New Guinea. The Soviet support was secret - the \"volunteers\" wearing Indonesian uniforms - however, the Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Soebandrio]] let the Russian willingness to actively provide military support leak to the American ambassador in Jakarta, according to Khrushchev\u2019s memoirs.<ref>Nikita Khrushchev, Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Volume 3: Statesman (1953-1964), ed.

In the United Nations General Assembly in 1961, the UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] asked [[Ellsworth Bunker]], an American diplomat, to submit proposals on solving the problem of the status of West Irian. Bunker proposed that the Netherlands submit West Irian to Indonesia through the United Nations within a period of 2 years.\n\n=== Economy ===\nOn December 27, 1958, President Sukarno issued Law No. 86 of 1958 concerning the nationalization of all Dutch companies in Indonesia.\nNationalized companies included:\n# Plantation companies\n# Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij\n# Electricity companies\n# Petroleum companies\n# Hospital (CBZ) becomes RSCM\nWhile other policies were implemented, including:\n# Moving the Indonesian [[tobacco]] auction market to [[Bremen]],[[West Germany]]\n# Dutch workers strike in Indonesia\n# Prohibiting [[KLM]] (a Dutch airline) from entering Indonesian airspace\n# Prohibiting the screening of Dutch films\n\n=== General Strategy ===\nIn accordance with the development of the Trikora situation, instructions were given by the Commander in Chief of the Highest Commodity of Liberation of West Irian No. 1 to the Commander of the Mandala, which were the following:\n* Plan, prepare and conduct military operations with the aim of returning the territory of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia.\n* Developing the situation in the Province of West Irian in accordance with the struggle in the field of diplomacy and in the shortest possible time in the West Irian Region creating de facto regions of Indonesian control.\n&nbsp;\nStrategies developed by the Commander of Mandala to carry out these instructions included:\n* Infiltration (until the end 1962), namely by deploying infantry units around certain targets to create a strong de facto free area that is resistant to destruction by the enemy and to develop territorial control by unifying the local populace.\n* Exploitation (early 1963), namely carrying out an open attack on the enemy military host and occupying all important enemy defense posts.\n* Consolidation (early 1964), namely by demonstrating the power and absolute sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia throughout West Irian.\n&nbsp;\n\n== Indonesian military operations ==\n[[File:NetherlandsNewGuinea-1916.jpg|thumb|The disputed territory of West New Guinea]]\nIn 1962, Indonesian incursions into the territory in the form of paratroop drops and the naval landings of guerrillas were used to step up Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Subandrio]]'s diplomatic confrontation with the Dutch.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 403\"/> Operation Trikora was to unfold in three phases: infiltration, exploitation and consolidation, all under cover of the [[Indonesian Air Force]]. The plan called first for the insertion of small bands of Indonesian troops by sea and by airdrop, who would then draw Dutch forces away from areas where the exploitation phase would stage full-scale amphibious landings and [[paratroop operation]]s to seize key locations. The consolidation phase would then expand Indonesian control over the whole of Western New Guinea.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" />\n\nOn 15 January 1962, the infiltration phase of Operation Trikora began when four [[Indonesian Navy]] motor torpedo boats attempted to land a unit of 150 marines on the south coast of New Guinea near Vlakke Hoek. The force was detected by a Dutch [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune]] aircraft and the Indonesian boats were intercepted by three Dutch destroyers. During the subsequent [[Battle of Arafura Sea]], one Indonesian boat was sunk and two others were badly damaged and forced to retreat. Thus, this planned Indonesian amphibious landing ended disastrously with many crew members and marines being killed, among them Commodore [[Yos Sudarso]], the Deputy Chief of the Indonesian Navy Staff. Some 55 survivors were captured. Over the next eight months, the Indonesian forces managed to insert 562 troops by sea and 1,154 by air drops. The inserted Indonesian troops conducted guerrilla operations throughout Western New Guinea from April 1962 onwards, but they were largely militarily ineffective. At least 94 Indonesian soldiers were killed and 73 were wounded during the hostilities. By contrast, the Dutch suffered only minimal casualties.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nIndonesian military activity continued to increase in the area through mid-1962 in preparation for the second phase of the operation. The Indonesian Air Force began to fly missions in the area from bases on surrounding islands, with Soviet-supplied [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bombers armed with [[KS-1 Komet]] anti-ship missiles deployed in anticipation of an attack against the {{HNLMS|Karel Doorman|R81|6}}.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nBy the summer of 1962, the Indonesian military had begun planning a large-scale amphibious and air assault against [[Biak]], the Netherlands' main power base in West Irian. This operation would have been known as [[Operation Jayawijaya]] (\"Victory over Imperialism\") and would have included a substantial task force of 60 ships including several which had been supplied by Sukarno's Soviet and Eastern Bloc allies.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /><ref name=\"Bilveer Singh, p.86\" /> On 13 and 14 August 1962, air drops of Indonesian troops were staged from Sorong in the northwest to Merauke in the southeast as a diversion for an amphibious assault against the Dutch military base at [[Biak Island]] by a force of 7,000 Army ([[Kopassus|RPKAD]]) and Air Force ([[Paskhas|PASGAT]]) paratroopers, 4,500 marines and 13,000 army servicemen, from various military districts (KODAMs). However, the Dutch Navy's [[Marid 6 Netherlands New Guinea]] (Marid 6 NNG) [[signals intelligence]] section and Neptune aircraft detected the invasion force and alerted their command.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nAccording to Wies Platje, the Royal Netherlands Navy was responsible for the defence of Western New Guinea. In 1962, the Dutch naval presence in New Guinea consisted of five anti-submarine destroyers, two frigates, three submarines, one survey vessel, one supply ship and two oil tankers. Dutch air power in Western New Guinea consisted of eleven Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune aircraft from the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militaireluchtvaartnederland.nl/planes/maritime-sar/58/lockheed-neptune-p2v-7-sp-2h-in-behandeling/|title=Maritime-sar \u2013 Militaire Luchtvaart Nederland|work=militaireluchtvaartnederland.nl|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref> plus 24 [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighters from the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. In addition, Dutch ground forces consisted of several anti-aircraft artillery units, five [[Royal Netherlands Marine Corps]] companies and three [[Royal Netherlands Army]] infantry battalions. As part of the planned defence, the Dutch had considered using Marid 6 NNG to disrupt the Indonesian military's communication systems.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Irian Barat Statue.JPG|thumb|The Sukarno-era \"West Irian Liberation Statue\" in Jakarta]]\nOn 15 August 1962, the Netherlands recognized Indonesia's resolve to take Western New Guinea. Since it was unwilling to be drawn into a protracted conflict on the other side of the world, the Dutch government signed the [[New York Agreement]], which handed the colony to an interim United Nations administration. Consequently, Operation Jayawijaya was called off and Western New Guinea was officially annexed by Indonesia in 1963. The Dutch decision to hand over Western New Guinea to Indonesia had been influenced by its main ally, the United States. While the Netherlands was a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and thus an ally of the Americans, the [[Kennedy Administration]] was unwilling to antagonize Indonesia since it was trying to court President Sukarno away from the Soviet orbit.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /> The Indonesian military's incursions into West Irian, plus the substantial Soviet military assistance to the Indonesian military, had convinced the United States government to pressure the Dutch to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"Soedjati Djiwandono p. 135\">Soedjati Djiwandono, ''Konfrontasi Revisited'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe New York Agreement was the result of negotiations that were spearheaded by the American diplomat [[Ellsworth Bunker]]. As a face-saving measure for the Dutch, Bunker arranged for a Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire which would be followed by the handover of Western New Guinea on 1 October to a temporary [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA). On 1 May 1963, Indonesia formally annexed Western New Guinea. As part of the New York Agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite, called the [[Act of Free Choice]], would be held in 1969 to determine whether the West Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination.<ref>J.D. Legge, 403\u2013404</ref> However, American efforts to win over Sukarno proved futile and Indonesia turned its attention to the former British colony of Malaysia, resulting in the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]]. Ultimately, President Sukarno was overthrown during the [[30 September Movement|Indonesian coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1965 and was replaced by the pro-Western Suharto.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /> The American mining company [[Freeport-McMoRan]] began exploiting Western New Guinea's copper and gold deposits.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 285</ref>\n\nFollowing the Act of Free Choice plebiscite in 1969, West Papua was formally integrated into the Republic of Indonesia. Instead of a referendum of the 816,000 Papuans, they were represented by 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives for the vote.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticized the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia supported Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. In all, 84 member states voted in favor for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 284</ref> Due to the Netherlands' efforts to promote a West Papuan national identity, a significant number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} of West Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia.

After negotiations, the Netherlands signed the [[New York Agreement]] with Indonesia on 15 August 1962, relinquishing control of Western New Guinea to the United Nations.\n\n== Background ==\nWhen the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]] became fully independent as Indonesia in December 1949, the Dutch retained sovereignty over the western part of the island of [[New Guinea]] and took steps to prepare it for independence as a separate country. The Dutch and West Papuan leaders argued that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the West Papuans were ethnically and geographically separated from Indonesians, had always been administrated separately, and that the West Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 282</ref> From its independence in 1949 until 1961, Indonesia attempted to gain control of Western New Guinea through the United Nations without success. Since the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], Indonesian nationalists had regarded Western New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the Indonesian state.<ref>Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, p. 45</ref> They also contended that [[Western New Guinea]] (Irian Barat) belonged to Indonesia and was being illegally occupied by the Dutch.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\">{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=February 2011 |title=Operation Trikora \u2013 Indonesia's Takeover of West New Guinea |journal=Pathfinder: Air Power Development Centre Bulletin |volume= |issue=150 |pages=1\u20132 |doi= |url=http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/publications/Details/443/150-Operation-TRIKORA---Indonesias-Takeover-of-West-New-Guinea.aspx |accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\">{{cite journal |last1=Platje |first1=Wies |year=2001 |title=Dutch Sigint and the Conflict with Indonesia 1950\u201362|journal=Intelligence and National Security |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=285\u2013312 |doi= 10.1080/714002840}}</ref>\n\nSince 1954, Indonesia had sporadically launched military raids into Western New Guinea. Following the failure of negotiations at the [[United Nations]], the president of Indonesia, [[Sukarno]], escalated pressure on the Netherlands by nationalising Dutch-owned businesses and estates and repatriating Dutch nationals. These actions increased tensions between Indonesia and the Netherlands led to a sharp reduction in trade between the two countries. Following a sustained period of harassment of Dutch diplomats in Indonesia, Indonesia formally severed ties with the Netherlands in August 1960. Indonesia also increased its military pressure on Dutch New Guinea by purchasing weapons from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Over the following years, the Sukarno government would become dependent on Soviet military support.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 402\">J.D. Legge, 402</ref>\n\nOn 19 December 1961, Sukarno decreed the establishment of the People's Triple Command or ''Tri Komando Rakyat'' (Trikora) in order to annex what Indonesia called [[West Irian]] by 1 January 1963. Trikora's operational command was to be called the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (''Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat'') with Major-General [[Suharto]] (the future President of Indonesia) serving as its commander. In preparation for the planned invasion, the Mandala command began making land, air, and sea incursions into West Irian.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"Bilveer Singh, p.86\">Bilveer Singh, ''West Irian and the Suharto Presidency'', p.86</ref> As a result, Indonesia began a policy of confronting the Dutch over control of Western New Guinea.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 402\"/> Sukarno also embarked on a policy of \"progressive mobilization\" to prepare the nation to carry out his commands.<ref>Soedjati Djiwandono, p. 131</ref>\n\nWhile the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia sided with the Netherlands' claims to Western New Guinea and were opposed to Indonesian expansionism, they were unwilling to commit military support to the Dutch. The Netherlands was unable to find sufficient international support for its New Guinea policy. By contrast, Sukarno was able to muster the support of the Soviet Union and its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In response to Indonesian claims, the Netherlands to sped up the process of implementing West Papuan self-rule from 1959 onward. These measures included the establishment of a legislative New Guinea Council in 1960, establishing hospitals, completion of a shipyard in [[Manokwari]], development of agricultural research sites and plantations; and the creation of the [[Papuan Volunteer Corps]] to defend the territory.<ref>Wies Platje, 297\u2013299</ref><ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 403\">J.D. Legge, 403</ref>\n\n== Preparation ==\n=== Military ===\n\nIndonesia began seeking weapons from abroad in response to the conflict with the Netherlands. Having failed to secure anything from the United States, General [[Abdul Haris Nasution|Nasution]] went to [[Moscow]] in December 1960 to negotiate what eventually turned out to be a US$2.5 Billion arms package with the Soviet government. The subsequent deliveries that arose from this deal led the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) to boast that Indonesia had the strongest air force in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe [[United States]] did not support the surrender of West Irian to Indonesia, since the [[Bureau of European Affairs]] considered it an act of trading one occupying power for another. However, in April 1961, Robert Komer and McGeorge Bundy began to prepare plans for the United Nations to give the impression that surrender to Indonesia was legal. Although reluctantly, President John F. Kennedy finally supported these plans, fearing that, without U.S support, the Indonesians would become further entrenched into the Soviet-bloc.\n\nIndonesia bought various kinds of military equipment, including 41 [[Mil Mi-4|Mi-4]] and nine [[Mil Mi-6|Mi-6]] helicopters, 30 [[MiG-15]], 49 [[MiG-17]], ten [[MiG-19]] and 20 [[MiG-21]] fighter jets, 12 [[Whiskey-class submarine|Whiskey]]-class submarines, 12 [[Komar-class missile boat|Komar-class]] missile boats, and one ex-Soviet Navy [[Sverdlov-class cruiser]] which was renamed the [[KRI Irian]]). Of the types of bombers, there were 22 [[Ilyushin Il-28]] light bombers, 14 [[TU-16 Badger|TU-16]] long-range medium bombers, and 12 maritime versions of TU-16 aircraft equipped to launch the [[AS-1 Kennel]] [[anti-ship missile|anti-ship missiles]]. Of the types of transport aircraft, there were 26 [[Ilyushin Il-14|IL-14]] and AQvia-14 light transport aircraft, six [[Antonov An-12]] heavy transports, and ten [[C-130 Hercules]] tactical transport aircraft.<ref name=\"Sibero\">{{cite news\u00a0| last = Sibero\u00a0| first = Tarigan\u00a0| title = Heroic Story of Seizing West Irian (1)\u00a0| publisher = TNI\u00a0| date = May 3, 2006 | url = http://www.tni.mil.id/news.php?q=dtl&id=113012006111078 }}</ref>\n\n=== Airbases ===\nTo achieve air superiority, the first preparations undertaken by the [[Indonesian Air Force|AURI]] were to repair war-damaged airbases, which would be used for infiltration operations and normal operations on the West Irian mainland. [[Air Base|Air bases]] and [[Landing Strip|landing strips]] which were common along the borders of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[West Irian]], were relics of [[Empire of Japan|imperial Japanese]] presence. Such airbases and landing strips were last used in 1945, and had since fallen into disrepair.\n\n===Soviet involvement===\nSoviet support of Indonesia played a crucial role in ending the conflict over New Guinea. Due to the support of Soviet submarines and bombers, Indonesian military forces could confidently launch an attack on Dutch troops. In response to Soviet presence, the United States put pressure on the Netherlands to relinquish control of West Papua. At the height of the Cold War, it was strategically critical that Indonesia remain outside the U.S.S.R's sphere of influence, which made the U.S willing to take action to ensure a neutral or friendly relationship with Indonesia. By enforcing the transfer of New Guinea, the United States could keep the regime of Sukarno friendly, despite not supporting the Netherlands which eventually gave way to American pressure and the threat of an attack on New Guinea. The Soviet support was secret - the \"volunteers\" wearing Indonesian uniforms - however, the Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Soebandrio]] let the Russian willingness to actively provide military support leak to the American ambassador in Jakarta, according to Khrushchev\u2019s memoirs.<ref>Nikita Khrushchev, Memoirs of Nikita Khrushchev: Volume 3: Statesman (1953-1964), ed.

In the United Nations General Assembly in 1961, the UN Secretary General [[U Thant]] asked [[Ellsworth Bunker]], an American diplomat, to submit proposals on solving the problem of the status of West Irian. Bunker proposed that the Netherlands submit West Irian to Indonesia through the United Nations within a period of 2 years.\n\n=== Economy ===\nOn December 27, 1958, President Sukarno issued Law No. 86 of 1958 concerning the nationalization of all Dutch companies in Indonesia.\nNationalized companies included:\n# Plantation companies\n# Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij\n# Electricity companies\n# Petroleum companies\n# Hospital (CBZ) becomes RSCM\nWhile other policies were implemented, including:\n# Moving the Indonesian [[tobacco]] auction market to [[Bremen]],[[West Germany]]\n# Dutch workers strike in Indonesia\n# Prohibiting [[KLM]] (a Dutch airline) from entering Indonesian airspace\n# Prohibiting the screening of Dutch films\n\n=== General Strategy ===\nIn accordance with the development of the Trikora situation, instructions were given by the Commander in Chief of the Highest Commodity of Liberation of West Irian No. 1 to the Commander of the Mandala, which were the following:\n* Plan, prepare and conduct military operations with the aim of returning the territory of West Irian to the Republic of Indonesia.\n* Developing the situation in the Province of West Irian in accordance with the struggle in the field of diplomacy and in the shortest possible time in the West Irian Region creating de facto regions of Indonesian control.\n&nbsp;\nStrategies developed by the Commander of Mandala to carry out these instructions included:\n* Infiltration (until the end 1962), namely by deploying infantry units around certain targets to create a strong de facto free area that is resistant to destruction by the enemy and to develop territorial control by unifying the local populace.\n* Exploitation (early 1963), namely carrying out an open attack on the enemy military host and occupying all important enemy defense posts.\n* Consolidation (early 1964), namely by demonstrating the power and absolute sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia throughout West Irian.\n&nbsp;\n\n== Indonesian military operations ==\n[[File:NetherlandsNewGuinea-1916.jpg|thumb|The disputed territory of West New Guinea]]\nIn 1962, Indonesian incursions into the territory in the form of paratroop drops and the naval landings of guerrillas were used to step up Indonesian Foreign Minister [[Subandrio]]'s diplomatic confrontation with the Dutch.<ref name=\"J.D. Legge, 403\"/> Operation Trikora was to unfold in three phases: infiltration, exploitation and consolidation, all under cover of the [[Indonesian Air Force]]. The plan called first for the insertion of small bands of Indonesian troops by sea and by airdrop, who would then draw Dutch forces away from areas where the exploitation phase would stage full-scale amphibious landings and [[paratroop operation]]s to seize key locations. The consolidation phase would then expand Indonesian control over the whole of Western New Guinea.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" />\n\nOn 15 January 1962, the infiltration phase of Operation Trikora began when four [[Indonesian Navy]] motor torpedo boats attempted to land a unit of 150 marines on the south coast of New Guinea near Vlakke Hoek. The force was detected by a Dutch [[Lockheed P-2 Neptune|Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune]] aircraft and the Indonesian boats were intercepted by three Dutch destroyers. During the subsequent [[Battle of Arafura Sea]], one Indonesian boat was sunk and two others were badly damaged and forced to retreat. Thus, this planned Indonesian amphibious landing ended disastrously with many crew members and marines being killed, among them Commodore [[Yos Sudarso]], the Deputy Chief of the Indonesian Navy Staff. Some 55 survivors were captured. Over the next eight months, the Indonesian forces managed to insert 562 troops by sea and 1,154 by air drops. The inserted Indonesian troops conducted guerrilla operations throughout Western New Guinea from April 1962 onwards, but they were largely militarily ineffective. At least 94 Indonesian soldiers were killed and 73 were wounded during the hostilities. By contrast, the Dutch suffered only minimal casualties.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nIndonesian military activity continued to increase in the area through mid-1962 in preparation for the second phase of the operation. The Indonesian Air Force began to fly missions in the area from bases on surrounding islands, with Soviet-supplied [[Tupolev Tu-16]] bombers armed with [[KS-1 Komet]] anti-ship missiles deployed in anticipation of an attack against the {{HNLMS|Karel Doorman|R81|6}}.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nBy the summer of 1962, the Indonesian military had begun planning a large-scale amphibious and air assault against [[Biak]], the Netherlands' main power base in West Irian. This operation would have been known as [[Operation Jayawijaya]] (\"Victory over Imperialism\") and would have included a substantial task force of 60 ships including several which had been supplied by Sukarno's Soviet and Eastern Bloc allies.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /><ref name=\"Bilveer Singh, p.86\" /> On 13 and 14 August 1962, air drops of Indonesian troops were staged from Sorong in the northwest to Merauke in the southeast as a diversion for an amphibious assault against the Dutch military base at [[Biak Island]] by a force of 7,000 Army ([[Kopassus|RPKAD]]) and Air Force ([[Paskhas|PASGAT]]) paratroopers, 4,500 marines and 13,000 army servicemen, from various military districts (KODAMs). However, the Dutch Navy's [[Marid 6 Netherlands New Guinea]] (Marid 6 NNG) [[signals intelligence]] section and Neptune aircraft detected the invasion force and alerted their command.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\nAccording to Wies Platje, the Royal Netherlands Navy was responsible for the defence of Western New Guinea. In 1962, the Dutch naval presence in New Guinea consisted of five anti-submarine destroyers, two frigates, three submarines, one survey vessel, one supply ship and two oil tankers. Dutch air power in Western New Guinea consisted of eleven Lockheed P2V-7B Neptune aircraft from the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://militaireluchtvaartnederland.nl/planes/maritime-sar/58/lockheed-neptune-p2v-7-sp-2h-in-behandeling/|title=Maritime-sar \u2013 Militaire Luchtvaart Nederland|work=militaireluchtvaartnederland.nl|accessdate=23 May 2016}}</ref> plus 24 [[Hawker Hunter]] jet fighters from the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]. In addition, Dutch ground forces consisted of several anti-aircraft artillery units, five [[Royal Netherlands Marine Corps]] companies and three [[Royal Netherlands Army]] infantry battalions. As part of the planned defence, the Dutch had considered using Marid 6 NNG to disrupt the Indonesian military's communication systems.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Irian Barat Statue.JPG|thumb|The Sukarno-era \"West Irian Liberation Statue\" in Jakarta]]\nOn 15 August 1962, the Netherlands recognized Indonesia's resolve to take Western New Guinea. Since it was unwilling to be drawn into a protracted conflict on the other side of the world, the Dutch government signed the [[New York Agreement]], which handed the colony to an interim United Nations administration. Consequently, Operation Jayawijaya was called off and Western New Guinea was officially annexed by Indonesia in 1963. The Dutch decision to hand over Western New Guinea to Indonesia had been influenced by its main ally, the United States. While the Netherlands was a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and thus an ally of the Americans, the [[Kennedy Administration]] was unwilling to antagonize Indonesia since it was trying to court President Sukarno away from the Soviet orbit.<ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /> The Indonesian military's incursions into West Irian, plus the substantial Soviet military assistance to the Indonesian military, had convinced the United States government to pressure the Dutch to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict.<ref name=\"Soedjati Djiwandono p. 135\">Soedjati Djiwandono, ''Konfrontasi Revisited'', p. 135.</ref>\n\nThe New York Agreement was the result of negotiations that were spearheaded by the American diplomat [[Ellsworth Bunker]]. As a face-saving measure for the Dutch, Bunker arranged for a Dutch-Indonesian ceasefire which would be followed by the handover of Western New Guinea on 1 October to a temporary [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]] (UNTEA). On 1 May 1963, Indonesia formally annexed Western New Guinea. As part of the New York Agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite, called the [[Act of Free Choice]], would be held in 1969 to determine whether the West Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination.<ref>J.D. Legge, 403\u2013404</ref> However, American efforts to win over Sukarno proved futile and Indonesia turned its attention to the former British colony of Malaysia, resulting in the [[Indonesian-Malaysian Confrontation]]. Ultimately, President Sukarno was overthrown during the [[30 September Movement|Indonesian coup d'\u00e9tat]] in 1965 and was replaced by the pro-Western Suharto.<ref name=\"Pathfinder2011\" /><ref name=\"WiesPlatje\" /> The American mining company [[Freeport-McMoRan]] began exploiting Western New Guinea's copper and gold deposits.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 285</ref>\n\nFollowing the Act of Free Choice plebiscite in 1969, West Papua was formally integrated into the Republic of Indonesia. Instead of a referendum of the 816,000 Papuans, they were represented by 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives for the vote.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticized the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia supported Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. In all, 84 member states voted in favor for the United Nations to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining.<ref>Ron Crocombe, 284</ref> Due to the Netherlands' efforts to promote a West Papuan national identity, a significant number{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=September 2017}} of West Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist [[Organisasi Papua Merdeka]] (Free Papua Movement) and have waged an [[Papua Conflict|insurgency]] against the Indonesian authorities, which still continues to this day.<ref name=\"Bilveer Singh, p.86\" /><ref>Ron Crocombe, 286-91</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last= Crocombe|first= Ron |authorlink= Ron Crocombe|title= Asia in the Pacific Islands |url= |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=IPS Publications, [[University of the South Pacific]] |location= [[Suva]], [[Fiji]]|isbn= |page=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Djiwandono|first= Soedjati |authorlink= Soedjati Djiwandono|title= Konfrontasi Revisited: Indonesia's Foreign Policy Under Soekarno |url= |accessdate= |year=1996 |publisher=[[Centre for Strategic and International Studies]] |location= [[Jakarta]]|isbn= |page=}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Kahin |first1=Audrey |authorlink1= |last2=Kahin|first2=George McTurnan |authorlink2=George McTurnan Kahin|title=Subversion as Foreign Policy: The Secret Eisenhower and Dulles Debacle in Indonesia |year=1995 |publisher=The New Press |location=New York |isbn= |page=}}\n* {{cite book |last= Legge|first= John D. |authorlink= John D.

Then in 1966, five squirrels were introduced to [[Nervi|Nervi, Italy]] in the park of Genoa. Later in 1994, three pairs were again released to a park in [[Trecate]] but were captured and removed in 1996.<ref name=\"Bertolino2003\" /> As stated before, not all grey squirrel introductions were intentional. For example, in 1966 two females and one male escaped from a game farm on [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\">Simberloff, D.

From studying all of the known successful introductions of this species, 71.4% used fewer than 10 individuals.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> This efficiency in the spread of grey squirrels can be explained by the [[EICA hypothesis|\"enemy release hypothesis\"]], which is when the invading species has better survival because its [[predation|natural predators]] are not present.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\">Strauss, A., White, A., & Boots, M.

Grey and red squirrels compete for resources, and greys will pilfer food caches of red squirrels.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\">Bertolino, S., Lurz, P.W.W., Sanderson, R. & Rushton, S.P.

Mammal Review, 22-33.</ref> Although the grey squirrel is often blamed in part for this decline in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], this is probably not the case for populations introduced to [[Italy]]. In those populations, the greys mainly feed on \"seeds, fruits, buds, flowers and, occasionally, on insects, switching from one resource to another according to seasonal availability\".<ref name=\"Bertolino2011\" />\n\n===Bark stripping===\nCertain behaviour of the grey squirrel, such as bark stripping, also has negative effects on trees and timber [[plantation]]s.<ref name=\"Bertolino2011\" /> This is thought to be biggest effect introduced squirrels have on [[Island ecology|island ecosystems]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> For example, [[Quercus garryana|Garry oak trees]] on [[Vancouver Island]] have become [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[Urban planning|urban development]] and the presence of [[invasive species]] including the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> Scatter-[[Hoarding (animal behavior)|hoarding]] of seeds by grey squirrels causes notching in the acorns of [[Quercus alba|white oaks]]. Notching prevents [[germination]], which can hinder natural [[Silviculture|forest regeneration]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" />  Bark stripping makes branches weaker and more susceptible to being broken off by wind or animals and can also cause secondary infection that may lead to death.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /><ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> Bark stripping makes trees more susceptible to [[Christmas tree pests and weeds#Fungal pests and diseases|red band needle blight (RBNB)]], which is caused by the [[Asexual reproduction|asexual stage]] of the [[fungus]] ''[[Dothistroma septosporum]]''. RBNB results in a necrotrophic infection that kills needle tissue in pine species. ''Phytophthora ramorum'' is another [[fungus]] affecting tree health.<ref name=\"Craig2012\">Craig M.

this represents a likely corridor to France for the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Mixed [[Deciduous|deciduous woodland]] lines the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino river]]; this area connects with contiguous [[hardwood]] on the side of [[Lake Maggiore]] in Switzerland, making the area along the Ticino river a likely corridor for the grey squirrel to invade Switzerland.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> The upper portion of the [[Alps]] is covered largely by [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]].<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Grey squirrels, which are heavier than native red squirrels, have a higher [[energy requirement]] than red squirrels.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> It may be difficult for the grey squirrels to attain their higher energy requirement in this environment because they may have difficulty reaching the small seeds contained in the [[Conifer cone|conifers' cones]]; for this reason, grey squirrel performance in this habitat will affect the spread of the species.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Eventually, if populations are left unchecked, the grey squirrel will spread through a large portion of [[continental Europe]] and [[Eurasia]], potentially invading the entire global distribution of the red squirrel.<ref name=\"Bertolino2003\" />\n\n===Predicted spread of the poxvirus and damage to trees===\nThe [[Poxvirus|squirrelpox virus]] is predicted to spread by the grey squirrels as they act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the virus.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> Further, a separate model examining the effects of the spread of the grey squirrel on the health of [[Scots pine|Scots]] and [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole]] pines showed that grey squirrels will spread [[Christmas tree pests and weeds#Fungal pests and diseases|red band needle blight (RBNB)]], decreasing the population of lodgepole pines exponentially, and that Scots pine populations will decrease slower due to [[Fungal development|fungal growth]] resulting from the bark-stripping behaviour of the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Craig2012\" />\n\n===Continued spread after attempted eradication===\nIn 1991, eradication of a grey squirrel population in [[Piedmont]] was attempted via trapping and [[euthanasia]];

Both species have similar diets, use similar locations of the environment and have similar activity patterns; however, there is no evidence of noticeable aggression between the two species.<ref name=\"Sandro2008\" /> These eastern grey squirrels are considered an [[invasive species]] in Europe because of their presence contributing to the displacement of the red squirrels.\n\nThe invasion of the grey squirrel in the [[United Kingdom]] can be classified as a Disease Mediated Invasion (DMI).<ref name=\"Strauss2012\">Strauss, A., White, A., & Boots, M. (2012) Invading with biological weapons: the importance of disease-mediated invasions. Functional Ecology, 26, 1249-1261.</ref> More specifically, the invasion of the grey squirrels and displacement of the red squirrels can be described by \"spillover DMI\", which is defined as a non-native species bringing diseases with them into the new area that will infect the native species. Spillover is especially an issue of when the invading species is [[morphology (biology)|morphologically similar]] to the native one. This can have devastating effects.\n\n==Introduction of grey squirrel to Europe==\nGrey squirrels have been introduced either on purpose or by accident in many places throughout the world.\n\nThey were first introduced into England, in a concerted way, in 1876,<ref name=\"Hickman2012\"/> and through rapidly growing population and further introductions they spread to the rest of [[Great Britain]] by the early-to-mid 20th century.<ref name=\"Okubo1989\"/>\n\nThe first reported introduction of grey squirrels in continental Europe was in 1948, and they were taken to [[Stupinigi|Stupinigi, Italy]], where there is still a growing population.<ref name=\"Bertolino2003\" /> In Ireland however, [[Thomas Pakenham, 5th Earl of Longford|Lord Longford]] was said to have introduced the American squirrels into his estate in 1911. Then in 1966, five squirrels were introduced to [[Nervi|Nervi, Italy]] in the park of Genoa. Later in 1994, three pairs were again released to a park in [[Trecate]] but were captured and removed in 1996.<ref name=\"Bertolino2003\" /> As stated before, not all grey squirrel introductions were intentional. For example, in 1966 two females and one male escaped from a game farm on [[Vancouver Island]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\">Simberloff, D. (2008) Rats are not the only introduced rodents producing ecosystem impacts on islands. Biological Invasions, 1735-1742.</ref>\n\nAlmost 80% of known grey squirrel introductions worldwide resulted in successful establishment in the new area.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\">Lawton, C., Cowan, P., Bertolino, S., Lurz, P.P.W. & Peters, A.R. (2010) The consequences of introducing non-indigenous species: two case studies, the grey squirrel in Europe and the brushtail possum in New Zealand. Rev. sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 29 (2), 287-297.</ref> Typically, grey squirrels do not need large numbers to start a new [[population]]. From studying all of the known successful introductions of this species, 71.4% used fewer than 10 individuals.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> This efficiency in the spread of grey squirrels can be explained by the [[EICA hypothesis|\"enemy release hypothesis\"]], which is when the invading species has better survival because its [[predation|natural predators]] are not present.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> Also, [[parasitism|natural parasites]] typically are not present in the area that the species has been introduced or has invaded.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> Because the grey squirrel poses such a threat to the trees and red squirrel in Europe, there is great effort to stop the further spread of the grey squirrels.\n\n==Impact on other species==\n===Competition for food===\nOne of the biggest concerns about the grey squirrel as an invasive species is the effect introduction has on populations of red squirrels. Grey and red squirrels compete for resources, and greys will pilfer food caches of red squirrels.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\">Bertolino, S., Lurz, P.W.W., Sanderson, R. & Rushton, S.P. (2008) Predicting the spread of the American grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe: A call for a co-ordinated European approach. Biological Conservation, 141, 2564-2575.</ref><ref name=\"Gossa2012\">Gossa, A., La Morgia, V., Marchisio, P., et al. (2012) Does a larger carrying capacity for an exotic species allow environment invasion? - Some considerations on the competition of red and grey squirrels. Journal of Biological Systems, 20, 221-234.</ref> Reduction in red squirrel individual growth, juvenile recruitment, and [[reproductive success]] has been linked to [[Competition (biology)|competition]] between grey and red squirrels.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /><ref name=\"Gossa2012\" /> In areas of large core overlap between red and grey squirrel populations, a reduction in body mass of red squirrels during the Spring has been observed.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> This is most likely due to the fact that reds and greys participate in direct [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for limited resources, suggesting there is no [[Niche differentiation|niche partitioning]] occurring.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> This direct competition also explains a decrease in juvenile recruitment and [[reproductive success]], as immature reds will die due to lack of resources before reaching [[sexual maturity]].\n\n===Poxvirus===\nIn addition to competition for resources, the spread of the squirrel [[poxvirus]] from grey squirrels to reds is thought to be a major factor in the decline of red squirrel populations.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> Grey squirrels do not die from the [[poxvirus|squirrelpox virus]] and can infect red squirrels causing the appearance of scabs and lesions on the face, feet, and genitals and eventually death.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> In [[Great Britain]], grey squirrels have been able to spread 17-25 times faster through [[Competitive exclusion principle|competitive exclusion]] of the red squirrel due to increased mortality of reds from the squirrelpox virus.<ref name=\"Sandro2008\" /> In fact, the virus works so quickly in killing its host after [[infection]] that seeing a red squirrel with [[poxvirus]] is uncommon even though the disease may be highly prevalent in a red squirrel population.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> The full consequences of these interactions cannot be completely determined, though the difference in [[population density]] and weight of the two species may have an effect on [[Energy flow (ecology)|energy flow in ecosystems]].<ref name=\"Sandro2008\" />\n\n===Woodland and songbird species===\nGrey squirrels also bear some of the responsibility for the decline of select woodland and [[songbird]] bird species as they sometimes feed on bird eggs and chicks.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /><ref name=\"Bertolino2011\">Bertolino, S. & Lurz, P. (2011) Callosciurus squirrels: worldwide introductions, ecological impacts and recommendations to prevent the establishment of new invasive populations. Mammal Review, 22-33.</ref> Although the grey squirrel is often blamed in part for this decline in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], this is probably not the case for populations introduced to [[Italy]]. In those populations, the greys mainly feed on \"seeds, fruits, buds, flowers and, occasionally, on insects, switching from one resource to another according to seasonal availability\".<ref name=\"Bertolino2011\" />\n\n===Bark stripping===\nCertain behaviour of the grey squirrel, such as bark stripping, also has negative effects on trees and timber [[plantation]]s.<ref name=\"Bertolino2011\" /> This is thought to be biggest effect introduced squirrels have on [[Island ecology|island ecosystems]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> For example, [[Quercus garryana|Garry oak trees]] on [[Vancouver Island]] have become [[Endangered species|endangered]] due to [[Urban planning|urban development]] and the presence of [[invasive species]] including the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> Scatter-[[Hoarding (animal behavior)|hoarding]] of seeds by grey squirrels causes notching in the acorns of [[Quercus alba|white oaks]]. Notching prevents [[germination]], which can hinder natural [[Silviculture|forest regeneration]].<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" />  Bark stripping makes branches weaker and more susceptible to being broken off by wind or animals and can also cause secondary infection that may lead to death.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /><ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> Bark stripping makes trees more susceptible to [[Christmas tree pests and weeds#Fungal pests and diseases|red band needle blight (RBNB)]], which is caused by the [[Asexual reproduction|asexual stage]] of the [[fungus]] ''[[Dothistroma septosporum]]''. RBNB results in a necrotrophic infection that kills needle tissue in pine species. ''Phytophthora ramorum'' is another [[fungus]] affecting tree health.<ref name=\"Craig2012\">Craig M. Shuttleworth, C. M.; Lurz, P.; Geddes, N.; Browne, J. (2012) Integrating red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) habitat requirements with the management of pathogenic tree disease in commercial forests in the UK. Forest Ecology and Management 279, 167\u2013175.</ref> Trees between 10 and 40 years of age and certain species, including [[beech]] and [[Acer pseudoplatanus|sycamore]], are more vulnerable than others.<ref name=\"Lawton2010\" /> Grey squirrels also damage trees by eating their [[Plant sap|sap]], suggesting this behaviour provides some nutritional benefit.<ref name=\"Sandro2008\" />\n\n==Predicted spread==\n\n===Predicted spread throughout Europe===\nSpatially explicit population dynamics models were used by Bertolino et al. 2008 to predict the spread of the grey squirrel populations present in [[Italy]] in 1996: the [[Piedmont]], [[Genoa]], and [[Ticino]] populations.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> The models examined potential corridors that would allow grey squirrels to invade France and Switzerland and the time scale of such invasions.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> In a scenario based on a random pattern of good, poor, and [[Mast (botany)|mast year]] seed crops (vegetation produces significant abundance of food resources), in the \"best case\" scenario, grey squirrels will reach the [[Western Alps]] between 2026 and 2036, [[France]] between 2066 and 2071, and [[Switzerland]] between 2051 and 2066.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> In a scenario where poor year seed crops were not included, the \"worst case\" scenario, grey squirrels will reach the Western Alps by 2015, France by 2026, and Switzerland between 2031 and 2041.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Along the border between France and Italy, the forest cover is mainly composed of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|mixed broadleaf]] trees; this represents a likely corridor to France for the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Mixed [[Deciduous|deciduous woodland]] lines the [[Ticino (river)|Ticino river]]; this area connects with contiguous [[hardwood]] on the side of [[Lake Maggiore]] in Switzerland, making the area along the Ticino river a likely corridor for the grey squirrel to invade Switzerland.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> The upper portion of the [[Alps]] is covered largely by [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forest]].<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Grey squirrels, which are heavier than native red squirrels, have a higher [[energy requirement]] than red squirrels.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> It may be difficult for the grey squirrels to attain their higher energy requirement in this environment because they may have difficulty reaching the small seeds contained in the [[Conifer cone|conifers' cones]]; for this reason, grey squirrel performance in this habitat will affect the spread of the species.<ref name=\"Bertolino2008\" /> Eventually, if populations are left unchecked, the grey squirrel will spread through a large portion of [[continental Europe]] and [[Eurasia]], potentially invading the entire global distribution of the red squirrel.<ref name=\"Bertolino2003\" />\n\n===Predicted spread of the poxvirus and damage to trees===\nThe [[Poxvirus|squirrelpox virus]] is predicted to spread by the grey squirrels as they act as a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] for the virus.<ref name=\"Strauss2012\" /> Further, a separate model examining the effects of the spread of the grey squirrel on the health of [[Scots pine|Scots]] and [[Pinus contorta|lodgepole]] pines showed that grey squirrels will spread [[Christmas tree pests and weeds#Fungal pests and diseases|red band needle blight (RBNB)]], decreasing the population of lodgepole pines exponentially, and that Scots pine populations will decrease slower due to [[Fungal development|fungal growth]] resulting from the bark-stripping behaviour of the grey squirrel.<ref name=\"Craig2012\" />\n\n===Continued spread after attempted eradication===\nIn 1991, eradication of a grey squirrel population in [[Piedmont]] was attempted via trapping and [[euthanasia]]; however, this effort was suspended for three years after [[animal rights]] groups filed a lawsuit.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> During the three-year suspension, the grey squirrel population had grown so much that it was no longer feasible to attempt eradication by the methods initially used.<ref name=\"Simberloff2008\" /> If the species spreads significantly (the three populations in Italy invade France or Switzerland and establish successful populations outside of Italy) before preventative or eradicative efforts are taken, it will, in all probability, be too late for effective action.<ref name=\"Bertolino2011\" />\n\n==Natural predator==\n[[File:Pine Marten BWC.JPG|thumb|European pine martens have kept grey squirrel populations in check in Ireland]]\n\nThe [[European pine marten]] is a natural predator of squirrels, including the eastern grey squirrel, but has been eradicated from large parts of the area affected by the grey squirrel such as England and Wales.<ref name=BC>{{cite journal|author1=Emma Sheehy, Colin Lawton|title=Population crash in an invasive species following the recovery of a native predator: the case of the American grey squirrel and the European pine marten in Ireland|journal=Biodiversity and Conservation|date=March 2014|volume=23|issue=3|pages=753\u2013774|doi=10.1007/s10531-014-0632-7}}</ref> The European pine marten's population is currently expanding and there is evidence that grey squirrel populations plummet where it becomes present, with the populations of the co-evolved red squirrel subsequently recovering.<ref>George Monbiot, [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/30/how-to-eradicate-grey-squirrels-without-firing-a-shot-pine-martens How to eradicate grey squirrels without firing a shot], ''Guardian'', January 30, 2015.</ref><ref>Emma Sheehy & Colin Lawton, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-014-0632-7 Population crash in an invasive species following the recovery of a native predator: the case of the American grey squirrel and the European pine marten in Ireland], ''[[Biodiversity and Conservation]]'', March 2014, Volume 23, Issue 3, pp. 753-774.</ref>\n\n==Proposed plans for control or eradication==\nAlthough the negative consequences of introduction of non-native species are generally known in the scientific community, the majority of the public is unaware of the effects on native [[ecosystem]]s.<ref name=\"Shine2011\">Shine, R. & Doody, J.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== History ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600 hp (1,900 kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO   submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600 hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke     turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]]. \n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.

The first units were imported fully built from the [[American Locomotive Company]] (Alco) in 1962. Since 1964, it has been manufactured in India by the [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi. The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], diesel (D), mixed traffic (M) engine. The WDM-2 is the most common diesel locomotive of Indian Railways.\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:18040 WDM-2 diesel loco at National Railway Museum, Delhi, Right:18233 WDM-2 Kundan, first diesel loco assembled at DLW,Varanasi\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 17212 WDM-2 diesel loco of BZA at Dwarapudi.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Loco series WDM at Chelama ghats.jpg\n| width2 = 150\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = Left:17212 WDM-2 diesel loco of Vijaywada (BZA), Right:17585 WDM-2 diesel loco of Moulali (MLY)\n}}\n\nIn the early 1960s [[Indian Railways]] began conversion of its mainline from steam to diesel locomotives. For this conversion [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) and the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCo) were asked to submit designs for new diesel locomotives. Each company submitted prototypes. Indian Railways designated these prototypes the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class and the WDM-2 class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production. The first few prototype WDM-2 were imported. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India. The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCo in the United States. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\nLater a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's\n\nThe WDM-2 is the diesel workhorse of the Indian Railways, being very reliable and rugged.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Technical specifications<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2d.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives -- Specific classes : AC Electric|website=www.irfca.org}}</ref> ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|Alco, DLW\n|-\n|Engine\n|Alco 251-B, [[V16 engine|16 cylinder engine]], {{convert|2600|hp|abbr=on|lk=on}} ({{convert|2430|hp|abbr=on|disp=or}} site rating) with Alco 710/720/?? turbo supercharged engine. 1,000 rpm max, 400 rpm idle; {{convert|228|x|266|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} bore x stroke; compression ratio 12.5:1.

It is a subgroup of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M9]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nTwo contrasting proposals have been made for the location and time of the origin of Haplogroup E.\nOne view is that the clade was formed over 30,000 years ago, around the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], on the northeast coast of [[Sundaland]] (near modern [[Borneo]]).\nIn this model, the haplogroup was dispersed by rising sea levels during the [[Late Glacial]] period.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1215}}{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}\n\nIn 2014, the mitochondrial DNA of an 8,000-year-old skeleton found on [[Liang Island]], one of the [[Matsu Islands]] off the southeast China coast, was found to belong to Haplogroup E, with two of the four mutations characteristic of the E1 subgroup.\nFrom this, Ko and colleagues argue that Haplogroup E arose 8,000 to 11,000 years ago near the north [[Fujian]] coast, travelled to Taiwan with Neolithic settlers 6,000 years ago, and from there spread to Maritime Southeast Asia with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] dispersal.{{sfn|Ko et al|2014}}\nSoares et al caution against over-emphasizing a single sample, and maintain that a constant [[molecular clock]] implies the earlier date (and more southerly origin) remains more likely.{{sfn|Soares et al|2016}}\n\n==Distribution==\nHaplogroup E is found throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}\nIt is nearly absent from mainland East Asia, where its sister group M9a (also found in Japan) is common.{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}{{sfn|Trejaut et al|2005}}\nIn particular, it is found among speakers of [[Austronesian languages]], and it is rare even in Southeast Asia among members of other language families. It has been detected in populations of [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] (including [[Sabah]] of [[Borneo]], but not the [[Orang Asli]] of peninsular Malaysia), coastal [[Papua New Guinea]], and especially in the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]] of the [[Mariana Islands]].{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}{{sfn|Tabbada et al|2010|pp=24, 28}}{{sfn|Peng et al|2010}}{{sfn|Hill et

Taiwan.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1213}}\nE2b has low diversity within Taiwan, suggesting that it arrived there about 5,000 years ago.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1213}}\nThe most common E subclade,

It is a subgroup of [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|haplogroup M9]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nTwo contrasting proposals have been made for the location and time of the origin of Haplogroup E.\nOne view is that the clade was formed over 30,000 years ago, around the time of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]], on the northeast coast of [[Sundaland]] (near modern [[Borneo]]).\nIn this model, the haplogroup was dispersed by rising sea levels during the [[Late Glacial]] period.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1215}}{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}\n\nIn 2014, the mitochondrial DNA of an 8,000-year-old skeleton found on [[Liang Island]], one of the [[Matsu Islands]] off the southeast China coast, was found to belong to Haplogroup E, with two of the four mutations characteristic of the E1 subgroup.\nFrom this, Ko and colleagues argue that Haplogroup E arose 8,000 to 11,000 years ago near the north [[Fujian]] coast, travelled to Taiwan with Neolithic settlers 6,000 years ago, and from there spread to Maritime Southeast Asia with the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] dispersal.{{sfn|Ko et al|2014}}\nSoares et al caution against over-emphasizing a single sample, and maintain that a constant [[molecular clock]] implies the earlier date (and more southerly origin) remains more likely.{{sfn|Soares et al|2016}}\n\n==Distribution==\nHaplogroup E is found throughout [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}\nIt is nearly absent from mainland East Asia, where its sister group M9a (also found in Japan) is common.{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}{{sfn|Trejaut et al|2005}}\nIn particular, it is found among speakers of [[Austronesian languages]], and it is rare even in Southeast Asia among members of other language families. It has been detected in populations of [[Taiwan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] (including [[Sabah]] of [[Borneo]], but not the [[Orang Asli]] of peninsular Malaysia), coastal [[Papua New Guinea]], and especially in the [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]] of the [[Mariana Islands]].{{sfn|Hill et al|2007}}{{sfn|Tabbada et al|2010|pp=24, 28}}{{sfn|Peng et al|2010}}{{sfn|Hill et al|2006}}{{sfn|Vilar et al|2013}}{{sfn|Peng et al|2011}}\n\nOf the four principal subclades, E1b and E2a are found mainly in Maritime Southeast Asia, while only E1a and E2b are also found in Taiwan.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1213}}\nE2b has low diversity within Taiwan, suggesting that it arrived there about 5,000 years ago.{{sfn|Soares et al|2008|p=1213}}\nThe most common E subclade, E1a1a, has highest diversity in Taiwan, followed by the Philippines and Sulawesi.\nMoreover, other branches of E1a1 are largely confined to Taiwan.{{sfn|Tabbada et

As the ethnic composition of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs concentrated on the \"policy racket\", also called the [[numbers game]], or ''bolita'' in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According to Francis Ianni, \"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\"<ref name=\"ianni\">Francis A.J. Ianni, ''Black Mafia'', 1974</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by [[bribe]]s from numbers bosses.<ref>\"Inside Story of Numbers Racket\", ''[[Amsterdam News]]'', August 21, 1954</ref> These bosses became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate. One of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame [[Stephanie St. Clair]], who fought gun battles with mobster [[Dutch Schultz]] over control of the lucrative trade.<ref>Cook, Fred J.

Once Dutch Schultz discovered this potential gold mine, he moved in, gang guns blazing. Madame St. Claire, who survived to become a big property owner and business woman in Harlem, fought Schultz from 1931 to 1935.\"</ref>\n\nThe popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the [[Lotteries in the United States|state lottery]], which is legal but has lower payouts and has taxes collected on winnings.<ref>Wilson, Michael.

They feared the legal game would wipe out the rackets and their jobs. They were, for the most part, right....

Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. [[Property crime]] was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with [[Single parent household|one parent]], or none, and lack of supervision contributed to [[juvenile delinquency]]; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.<ref>''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphonso Pinkney & Roger Woock, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970, p.33</ref>\n\nInjecting [[heroin]] grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use of this drug then leveled off.

In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups.

Several riots happened in this period, including in [[1935 Harlem riot|1935]] and [[Harlem riot of 1943|1943]].\n\nThere were major changes following [[World War II]].

As the ethnic composition of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs concentrated on the \"policy racket\", also called the [[numbers game]], or ''bolita'' in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According to Francis Ianni, \"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\"<ref name=\"ianni\">Francis A.J. Ianni, ''Black Mafia'', 1974</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by [[bribe]]s from numbers bosses.<ref>\"Inside Story of Numbers Racket\", ''[[Amsterdam News]]'', August 21, 1954</ref> These bosses became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate. One of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame [[Stephanie St. Clair]], who fought gun battles with mobster [[Dutch Schultz]] over control of the lucrative trade.<ref>Cook, Fred J. [https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/04/archives/the-black-mafia-moves-into-the-numbers-racket-the-numbers-racket.html \"The Black Mafia Moves Into the Numbers Racket\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 4, 1971. Accessed December 28, 2016. \"In those days, Madame Stephanie St. Clair became known as the \u201cPolicy Queen\u201d of Harlem.... Once Dutch Schultz discovered this potential gold mine, he moved in, gang guns blazing. Madame St. Claire, who survived to become a big property owner and business woman in Harlem, fought Schultz from 1931 to 1935.\"</ref>\n\nThe popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the [[Lotteries in the United States|state lottery]], which is legal but has lower payouts and has taxes collected on winnings.<ref>Wilson, Michael. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/nyregion/numbers-runner-a-rarity-is-arrested-in-harlem.html \"Relics of the Bygone (and the Illegal)\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 22, 2013. Accessed December 28, 2016. \"Several years later, with the state lottery offering a similar game, runners and numbers bankers openly protested in Manhattan. They feared the legal game would wipe out the rackets and their jobs. They were, for the most part, right.... The few numbers joints that survive do so in part because the payouts are often better than the lottery, the police said.\"</ref> The practice continues on a smaller scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust their local numbers bank to the state.\n\nStatistics from 1940 show about 100 murders per year in Harlem, \"but rape is very rare\".<ref name=\"look1940\">\"244,000 Native Sons\", ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' Magazine, May 21, 1940, p.8+</ref> By 1950, essentially all of the [[White flight|whites had left]] Harlem and by 1960, much of the black [[Middle class in the United States|middle class]] had departed. At the same time, control of organized crime shifted from Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban groups that were somewhat less formally organized.<ref name=\"ianni\"/> At the time of the [[Harlem Riot of 1964|1964 riots]], the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher than the New York City average, and twelve times higher than the United States as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. [[Property crime]] was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with [[Single parent household|one parent]], or none, and lack of supervision contributed to [[juvenile delinquency]]; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.<ref>''Poverty and Politics in Harlem'', Alphonso Pinkney & Roger Woock, College & University Press Services, Inc., 1970, p.33</ref>\n\nInjecting [[heroin]] grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use of this drug then leveled off. In the 1980s, use of [[crack cocaine]] became widespread, which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance their purchasing of additional drugs, and as dealers fought for the right to sell in particular regions, or over deals gone bad.<ref>\"Harlem Speaks: A Living History of the Harlem Renaissance.\" Wintz, Cary.</ref>\n\nWith the end of the \"[[crack epidemic|crack wars]]\" in the mid-1990s, and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayors [[David Dinkins]] and his successor [[Rudy Giuliani]], crime in Harlem plummeted.

Meanwhile, 25% of Central Harlem households and 27% of adults reported seeing cockroaches (a potential trigger for asthma), a rate higher than the city average. Neighborhood conditions are also indicators of population: in 2014, Central Harlem had 32 per 100,000 people hospitalized due to pedestrian injuries, higher than Manhattan's and the city's average.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAdditionally, poverty levels can indicate one\u2019s risk of vulnerability to asthma. In 2016, Central Harlem saw 565 children aged 5\u201317 years old per 10,000 residents visiting emergency departments for Asthma emergencies, over twice both Manhattan's and the citywide rates. The rate of childhood asthma hospitalization in 2016 was more than twice that of Manhattan and New York City, with 62 hospitalizations per 10,000 residents.<ref name=\":4\" />  Rates of adult hospitalization due to asthma in Central Harlem trends higher in comparison to other neighborhoods.
