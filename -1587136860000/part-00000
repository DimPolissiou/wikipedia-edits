The largest, ''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'', is an [[evergreen]] tree that can grow to 18 m tall. They usually grow on [[soil salinity|saline soils]], tolerating up to 15,000 ppm soluble [[sodium chloride|salt]] and can also tolerate alkaline conditions.\n\nTamarisks are characterized by slender branches and grey-green foliage. The bark of young branches is smooth and reddish brown. As the plants age, the bark becomes bluish-purple, ridged and furrowed.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, almost like that of junipers,<ref>{{ Citation | last=Dirr| first=Michael A. | title=Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs, an illustrated encyclopedia  | journal=| year=1997| page=392}}.</ref> 1\u20132 mm long, and overlap each other along the stem. They are often encrusted with salt secretions.\n\nThe pink to white [[flower]]s appear in dense [[Inflorescence|masses]] on 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long spikes at branch tips from March to September, though some species (e.g., ''T. aphylla'') tend to flower during the winter.\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Tamarix'' can spread both [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], by [[Adventitiousness|adventitious]] roots or submerged stems, and sexually, by [[seed]]s. Each flower can produce thousands of tiny (1&nbsp;mm diameter) seeds that are contained in a small capsule usually adorned with a tuft of hair that aids in wind dispersal. Seeds can also be dispersed by water. Seedlings require extended periods of soil saturation for establishment. Tamarisk trees are most often propagated by [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]].\n\n''Tamarix'' species are fire-adapted, and have long tap roots that allow them to intercept deep [[water table]]s and exploit natural [[hydrology|water resources]]. They are able to limit competition from other plants by taking up salt from deep ground water, accumulating it in their foliage, and from there depositing it in the surface soil where it builds up concentrations temporarily detrimental to some plants. The salt is washed away during heavy rains.\n\n''Tamarix'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including ''[[Coleophora|Coleophora asthenella]]'' which feeds exclusively on ''T. africana''.\n\n==Uses==\n* Tamarisk species are used as ornamental shrubs, windbreaks, and shade trees: notably [[Tamarix ramosissima|''T. ramosissima'']] and [[Tamarix tetrandra|''T. tetrandra'']]\n\n*This wood was used by the [[Saka]] (combined with wood and ibex horn) to produce tremendously powerful bows hundreds of years before the common era. <ref>http://www.atarn.org/chinese/Yanghai/Scythian_bow_ATARN.pdf</ref>\n\n* The wood may be used for carpentry or firewood: it is a possible [[agroforestry]] species<ref name = fao>[http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=10274 Tamarix aphylla], in Ecocrop.</ref><ref>Abigail Klein Leichman, israel21c.org: [http://israel21c.org/environment/growing-forests-in-the-desert Growing forests in the desert].</ref>\n* Plans are being made for the tamarisk to play a role in anti[[desertification]] programs in [[China]]<ref name = amb>[http://www.ambchine.mu/eng/xwdt/t369657.htm Tree by Tree, China Rolls Back Deserts.]</ref><ref name = asiaww>[http://www.asiawaterwire.net/node/466 Taklamakan - Where Oil and Water Don't Mix]</ref>\n* Salt cedars can be planted to mine salts, then be used in the production of fuel and fertilizer (although the latter will be somewhat salty)<ref name = duke>[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Eichornia_crassipes.html Eichornia crassipes], in ''Handbook of Energy Crops''.

The high salt level in tamarisk infiltrates the soil, preventing other plants from growing, creating a tamarisk-dominant forest with no [[understory]], void of important habitat for pollinators and other native species. Tamarisk forests also tend to burn hotter than most native riparian trees, worsening the fire hazard of acres of uninterrupted tamarisk and their risk to human structures.\n\nTamarisk eradication projects use a combination of methods, including manual stem cutting followed by application of herbicide to the stump and burning.\n\n==Selected species==\n[[Image:Tamarix gallica bloemen.jpg|right|thumb|''Tamarix gallica'' in flower]]\n[[Image:Tamaris3.jpg|right|thumb|A ''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'' specimen in its natural habitat in [[Algeria]]]]\n[[Image:Ateybeh,March 2014.JPG|right|thumb|Tamarix in [[Ateybeh]] Village, [[Bushehr Province|Boushehr]], [[Iran]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*''[[Tamarix africana]]'' <small>Poir.</small>\n*''[[Tamarix androssowii]]'' <small></small>\n*''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'' <small>(L.)

The largest, ''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'', is an [[evergreen]] tree that can grow to 18 m tall. They usually grow on [[soil salinity|saline soils]], tolerating up to 15,000 ppm soluble [[sodium chloride|salt]] and can also tolerate alkaline conditions.\n\nTamarisks are characterized by slender branches and grey-green foliage. The bark of young branches is smooth and reddish brown. As the plants age, the bark becomes bluish-purple, ridged and furrowed.\n\nThe [[leaf|leaves]] are scale-like, almost like that of junipers,<ref>{{ Citation | last=Dirr| first=Michael A. | title=Dirr's Hardy Trees and Shrubs, an illustrated encyclopedia  | journal=| year=1997| page=392}}.</ref> 1\u20132 mm long, and overlap each other along the stem. They are often encrusted with salt secretions.\n\nThe pink to white [[flower]]s appear in dense [[Inflorescence|masses]] on 5\u201310&nbsp;cm long spikes at branch tips from March to September, though some species (e.g., ''T. aphylla'') tend to flower during the winter.\n\n==Reproduction==\n''Tamarix'' can spread both [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], by [[Adventitiousness|adventitious]] roots or submerged stems, and sexually, by [[seed]]s. Each flower can produce thousands of tiny (1&nbsp;mm diameter) seeds that are contained in a small capsule usually adorned with a tuft of hair that aids in wind dispersal. Seeds can also be dispersed by water. Seedlings require extended periods of soil saturation for establishment. Tamarisk trees are most often propagated by [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]].\n\n''Tamarix'' species are fire-adapted, and have long tap roots that allow them to intercept deep [[water table]]s and exploit natural [[hydrology|water resources]]. They are able to limit competition from other plants by taking up salt from deep ground water, accumulating it in their foliage, and from there depositing it in the surface soil where it builds up concentrations temporarily detrimental to some plants. The salt is washed away during heavy rains.\n\n''Tamarix'' species are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of some [[Lepidoptera]] species including ''[[Coleophora|Coleophora asthenella]]'' which feeds exclusively on ''T. africana''.\n\n==Uses==\n* Tamarisk species are used as ornamental shrubs, windbreaks, and shade trees: notably [[Tamarix ramosissima|''T. ramosissima'']] and [[Tamarix tetrandra|''T. tetrandra'']]\n\n*This wood was used by the [[Saka]] (combined with wood and ibex horn) to produce tremendously powerful bows hundreds of years before the common era. <ref>http://www.atarn.org/chinese/Yanghai/Scythian_bow_ATARN.pdf</ref>\n\n* The wood may be used for carpentry or firewood: it is a possible [[agroforestry]] species<ref name = fao>[http://ecocrop.fao.org/ecocrop/srv/en/cropView?id=10274 Tamarix aphylla], in Ecocrop.</ref><ref>Abigail Klein Leichman, israel21c.org: [http://israel21c.org/environment/growing-forests-in-the-desert Growing forests in the desert].</ref>\n* Plans are being made for the tamarisk to play a role in anti[[desertification]] programs in [[China]]<ref name = amb>[http://www.ambchine.mu/eng/xwdt/t369657.htm Tree by Tree, China Rolls Back Deserts.]</ref><ref name = asiaww>[http://www.asiawaterwire.net/node/466 Taklamakan - Where Oil and Water Don't Mix]</ref>\n* Salt cedars can be planted to mine salts, then be used in the production of fuel and fertilizer (although the latter will be somewhat salty)<ref name = duke>[http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Eichornia_crassipes.html Eichornia crassipes], in ''Handbook of Energy Crops''.

Duke. 1983.</ref>\n\n==Invasive species==\n''[[Tamarix ramosissima]]'' has naturalized and become a major [[Invasive species|invasive plant species]] in parts of the world, such as in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Desert Region of California]], consuming large amounts of groundwater in [[riparian]] and [[oasis]] habitats due to the density of its stands. The high salt level in tamarisk infiltrates the soil, preventing other plants from growing, creating a tamarisk-dominant forest with no [[understory]], void of important habitat for pollinators and other native species. Tamarisk forests also tend to burn hotter than most native riparian trees, worsening the fire hazard of acres of uninterrupted tamarisk and their risk to human structures.\n\nTamarisk eradication projects use a combination of methods, including manual stem cutting followed by application of herbicide to the stump and burning.\n\n==Selected species==\n[[Image:Tamarix gallica bloemen.jpg|right|thumb|''Tamarix gallica'' in flower]]\n[[Image:Tamaris3.jpg|right|thumb|A ''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'' specimen in its natural habitat in [[Algeria]]]]\n[[Image:Ateybeh,March 2014.JPG|right|thumb|Tamarix in [[Ateybeh]] Village, [[Bushehr Province|Boushehr]], [[Iran]]]]\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*''[[Tamarix africana]]'' <small>Poir.</small>\n*''[[Tamarix androssowii]]'' <small></small>\n*''[[Tamarix aphylla]]'' <small>(L.)

It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]].

[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees.\n\n[[File:Curry County Eastern New Mexico 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] in [[Eastern New Mexico]], but also located in [[Colorado Eastern Plains|Eastern Colorado]] and [[West Texas]]]]\nLandscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains, canyons, mesas, [[butte]]s, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some plains, characteristic of the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain. The far eastern part of southwestern Texas, for example the [[Texas Hill Country]], consists of dry, tall, and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite. [[South Texas]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley]] is mostly flat with many places consisting of scrub and bare topsoil, much like the deserts further west.\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe region has an extremely diverse bird population, with hundreds of species being found in the American Southwest.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

He calls the first subregion \"[[Northern New Mexico]]\", and describes it as focused on [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called [[Central New Mexico]].\n\n\"Central Arizona\" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and many others.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 103\u2013106</ref>\n\nMeinig calls the third subregion \"El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands\". While [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada. This will be the defined scope which is used in this article, unless otherwise specified in a particular area.<ref name=LCASDefine />\n\n===Geological/topographical===\nFrom this perspective, almost all of the region's physiographical traits, geological formations, and weather are contained within a box between 26\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 northern latitude, and 98\u00b0 30' and  124\u00b0 western longitude.<ref name=UAtsd>{{cite web | url=http://jsw.library.arizona.edu/3403/defined.html | publisher=University of Arizona | title=The Southwest Defined | editor-last=Wilder | editor-first=Joseph Carlton | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological===\nWhen looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest. The Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research defines the Southwest as being only the states of Arizona, New Mexico, with parts of California, Nevada, Texas, and Utah; although they include all of those six states in their map of the region, solely for ease of defining the border.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://southwesternherp.com/americansouthwestdefined.html | publisher=Southwestern Center for Herpetological Research | title=The American Southwest Defined | accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Cultural===\n[[File:LCASMapoftheSouthwest.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Southwestern United States as defined by the Learning Center of the American Southwest<ref name=LCASDefine/>]]\nParts of the other states make up the various areas which can be included in the Southwest, depending on the source.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

Compared to other [[fossil fuel|hydrocarbon fuels]], methane produces less [[carbon dioxide]] for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's [[heat of combustion]] is lower than that of any other hydrocarbon. However, it produces more heat per mass (55.7 kJ/g) than any other organic molecule due to its relatively large content of hydrogen, which accounts for 55% of the heat of combustion<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b00333 | title = Why Combustions Are Always Exothermic, Yielding About 418 kJ per Mole of O2 | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 92 | issue = 12 | pages = 2094\u20132099 | year = 2015 | last1 = Schmidt-Rohr | first1 = Klaus | bibcode = 2015JChEd..92.2094S }}</ref> but contributes only 25% of the molecular mass of methane. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for domestic [[heating]] and cooking. In this context it is usually known as [[natural gas]], which is considered to have an energy content of 39 [[megajoule]]s per cubic meter, or 1,000 [[British thermal unit|BTU]] per [[standard cubic foot]]. [[Liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) is predominantly methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) converted into liquid form for ease of storage or transport.\n\nAs a rocket fuel, methane offers the advantage over [[kerosene]] of depositing less carbon on the internal parts of rocket motors, reducing the difficulty of re-use of boosters.\n\n===Chemical feedstock===\n[[Natural gas]], which is mostly composed of methane, is used to produce hydrogen gas on an industrial scale. [[Steam Methane Reforming]] (SMR), is the most common method of producing commercial bulk hydrogen gas.\nMore than 50 million metric tons are produced annually worldwide (2013), principally from SMR of natural gas.<ref>https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/hpep_report_2013.pdf</ref> Much of this hydrogen is used in petroleum refineries, in the production of chemicals and in food processing. Very large quantities of hydrogen are used in the [[Ammonia production|industrial synthesis of ammonia]].\n\nAt high temperatures (700 &ndash; 1100&nbsp;\u00b0C) and in the presence of a [[metal]]-based [[catalyst]] ([[nickel]]), steam reacts with methane to yield a mixture of [[Carbon monoxide|CO]] and [[Dihydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]], known as \"Water gas\" or \"Syn-gas\":\n\n:CH<sub>4</sub> + [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] \u21cc [[carbon monoxide|CO]] + 3 [[hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]\nThis reaction is strongly [[endothermic]] (consumes heat, \u0394H<sub>r</sub>= 206 kJ/mol).\nAdditional hydrogen is obtained by the reaction of [[carbon monoxide|CO]] with water via the [[water-gas shift reaction]].\n:CO + H<sub>2</sub>O \u21cc [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] + H<sub>2</sub>\nThis reaction is mildly [[exothermic]] (produces heat, \u0394H<sub>r</sub>= -41 kJ/mol).\n\nMethane is also subjected to free-radical [[chlorination reaction|chlorination]] in the production of chloromethanes, although [[methanol]] is a more typical precursor.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">Rossberg, M.

Most methane in sedimentary basins is thermogenic; therefore, thermogenic methane is the most important source of natural gas. Thermogenic methane components are typically considered to be relic (from an earlier time). Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth) can occur through organic matter breakup, or organic synthesis. Both ways can involve microorganisms ([[methanogenesis]]), but may also occur inorganically. The processes involved can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms.\n\nThe more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic. Abiotic means that methane is created from inorganic compounds, without biological activity, either through magmatic processes or via water-rock reactions that occur at low temperatures and pressures, like [[Serpentinite|serpentinization]].<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|author=Kiet\u00e4v\u00e4inen and Purkamo|year=2015|title=The origin, source, and cycling of methane in deep crystalline rock biosphere|journal=Front.

Methane is produced by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] carbon dioxide through the [[Sabatier process]]. Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]], which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane.\n\nExample of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the [[Great Plains Synfuels]] plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade [[lignite]], a resource that is otherwise difficult to transport for its weight, [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]] content, low calorific value and propensity to [[spontaneous combustion]] during storage and transport.\n\n[[Power to gas#Power to methane|Power to methane]] is a technology that uses [[electricity|electrical power]] to produce hydrogen from water by [[electrolysis]] and uses the [[Sabatier reaction]] to combine hydrogen with [[carbon dioxide]] to produce methane. As of 2016, this is mostly under development and not in large-scale use. Theoretically, the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off-peak power generated by highly fluctuating [[wind generators]] and [[Solar panel|solar arrays]]. However, as currently very large amounts of natural gas are used in power plants (e.g. [[Combined cycle|CCGT]]) to produce electric energy, the losses in efficiency are not acceptable.\n\n====Laboratory synthesis====\nMethane can be produced by protonation of [[methyl lithium]] and [[methylmagnesium iodide]]. In practice, a requirement for pure methane will be filled with a steel gas bottle from standard suppliers.\n\n==Occurrence==\nMethane was discovered and isolated by [[Alessandro Volta]] between 1776 and 1778 when studying [[marsh gas]] from [[Lake Maggiore]]. It is the major component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as [[natural gas fields]], with [[coal seam gas]] extraction becoming a major source (see [[Coal bed methane extraction]], a method for extracting methane from a [[coal]] deposit, while [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]] is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, and sometimes accompanied by [[helium]] and [[nitrogen]]. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Decomposition|decay]] of [[organic matter]] and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the [[sediment]]s that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain [[Petroleum|oil]].\n\nMethane is generally transported in bulk by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] in its natural gas form, or LNG carriers in its liquefied form; few countries transport it by truck.\n\n===Atmospheric methane===\n{{anchor|Methane in Earth.27s atmosphere}}\n{{anchor|Methane as a greenhouse gas}}\n{{Main|Atmospheric methane}}\n[[File:Mlo ch4 ts obs 03437.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Methane concentration evolution from 1987 to October 2019 at Mauna Loa (Hawaii).]]\nIn 2010, methane levels in the Arctic were measured at 1850 nmol/mol.

Volta was inspired to search for the substance after reading a paper written by [[Benjamin Franklin]] about \"flammable air\".<ref name=\"Volta\">Volta, Alessandro (1777) [https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en/record/9200332/BibliographicResource_3000123618397.html ''Lettere del Signor Don Alessandro Volta ...

The radical is named after this because it was first detected in wood alcohol. The chemical suffix \"''-ane''\" is from the coordinating chemical suffix \"''-ine''\" which is from Latin feminine suffix \"''-ina''\" which is applied to represent abstracts. The coordination of \"-ane\", \"-ene\", \"-one\", etc. was proposed in 1866 by German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892).\n\n==Safety==\nMethane is [[nontoxic]], yet it is extremely flammable and may form [[explosive]] mixtures with air. Methane is also an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can [[Cabin pressurization#need for cabin pressurisation|tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects]]. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5\u201315% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near [[landfills]] and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.\n\nMethane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mining.about.com/od/Accidents/a/Common-Mining-Accidents.htm|title=Common Mining Accidents|author=Dozolme, Philippe |publisher=About.com}}</ref> A methane gas explosion was the cause of the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster|Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster]] in [[West Virginia]] on April 5, 2010, killing 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_mine_explosion|author1=Lawrence Messina  |author2=Greg Bluestein |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Fed official: Still too soon for W.Va. mine rescue|publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[2007 Zasyadko mine disaster]]\n* [[Abiogenic petroleum origin]]\n* [[Aerobic methane production]]\n* [[Anaerobic digestion]]\n* [[Anaerobic respiration]]\n* [[Arctic methane emissions]]\n* [[Atmospheric methane]]\n* [[Biogas]]\n* [[Coal Oil Point seep field]]\n* [[Energy density]]\n* [[Fugitive gas emissions]]\n* [[Gas]]\n* [[Global Methane Initiative]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Greenhouse gas]]\n* [[Halomethane]], halogenated methane derivatives.\n* [[Hydrogen cycle|Hydrogen Cycle]]\n* [[Industrial gas]]\n* [[Lake Kivu]] (more general: [[limnic eruption]])\n* [[List of straight-chain alkanes]]\n* [[Methanation]]\n* [[Methane clathrate]], ice that contains methane.\n* [[Methane (data page)]]\n* [[Methane emissions]]\n* Methane on Mars: [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|atmosphere]]\n* Methane on Mars: [[Climate of Mars#Methane presence|climate]]\n* [[Methanogen]], [[archaea]] that produce methane.\n* [[Methanogenesis]], [[microbes]] that produce methane.\n* [[Methanotroph]], [[bacteria]] that grow with methane.\n* [[Methyl group]], a functional group related to methane.\n* [[Thomas Gold]]{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes = {{efn |name=serpentinization |There are many [[serpentinite|''serpentinization'']] reactions.

Generally, formation of thermogenic methane (at depth) can occur through organic matter breakup, or organic synthesis. Both ways can involve microorganisms ([[methanogenesis]]), but may also occur inorganically. The processes involved can also consume methane, with and without microorganisms.\n\nThe more important source of methane at depth (crystalline bedrock) is abiotic.

Methane is produced by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] carbon dioxide through the [[Sabatier process]]. Methane is also a side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]], which is practiced on a large scale to produce longer-chain molecules than methane.\n\nExample of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the [[Great Plains Synfuels]] plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade [[lignite]], a resource that is otherwise difficult to transport for its weight, [[Coal assay#Ash|ash]] content, low calorific value and propensity to [[spontaneous combustion]] during storage and transport.\n\n[[Power to gas#Power to methane|Power to methane]] is a technology that uses [[electricity|electrical power]] to produce hydrogen from water by [[electrolysis]] and uses the [[Sabatier reaction]] to combine hydrogen with [[carbon dioxide]] to produce methane. As of 2016, this is mostly under development and not in large-scale use. Theoretically, the process could be used as a buffer for excess and off-peak power generated by highly fluctuating [[wind generators]] and [[Solar panel|solar arrays]]. However, as currently very large amounts of natural gas are used in power plants (e.g. [[Combined cycle|CCGT]]) to produce electric energy, the losses in efficiency are not acceptable.\n\n====Laboratory synthesis====\nMethane can be produced by protonation of [[methyl lithium]] and [[methylmagnesium iodide]]. In practice, a requirement for pure methane will be filled with a steel gas bottle from standard suppliers.\n\n==Occurrence==\nMethane was discovered and isolated by [[Alessandro Volta]] between 1776 and 1778 when studying [[marsh gas]] from [[Lake Maggiore]]. It is the major component of natural gas, about 87% by volume. The major source of methane is extraction from geological deposits known as [[natural gas fields]], with [[coal seam gas]] extraction becoming a major source (see [[Coal bed methane extraction]], a method for extracting methane from a [[coal]] deposit, while [[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]] is a method of recovering methane from non-mineable coal seams). It is associated with other [[hydrocarbon]] fuels, and sometimes accompanied by [[helium]] and [[nitrogen]]. Methane is produced at shallow levels (low pressure) by [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Decomposition|decay]] of [[organic matter]] and reworked methane from deep under the Earth's surface. In general, the [[sediment]]s that generate natural gas are buried deeper and at higher temperatures than those that contain [[Petroleum|oil]].\n\nMethane is generally transported in bulk by [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] in its natural gas form, or LNG carriers in its liquefied form; few countries transport it by truck.\n\n===Atmospheric methane===\n{{anchor|Methane in Earth.27s atmosphere}}\n{{anchor|Methane as a greenhouse gas}}\n{{Main|Atmospheric methane}}\n[[File:Mlo ch4 ts obs 03437.png|upright=1.35|thumb|right|Methane concentration evolution from 1987 to October 2019 at Mauna Loa (Hawaii).]]\nIn 2010, methane levels in the Arctic were measured at 1850 nmol/mol.

The chemical suffix \"''-ane''\" is from the coordinating chemical suffix \"''-ine''\" which is from Latin feminine suffix \"''-ina''\" which is applied to represent abstracts. The coordination of \"-ane\", \"-ene\", \"-one\", etc. was proposed in 1866 by German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892).\n\n==Safety==\nMethane is [[nontoxic]], yet it is extremely flammable and may form [[explosive]] mixtures with air. Methane is also an [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]] if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below about 16% by displacement, as most people can [[Cabin pressurization#need for cabin pressurisation|tolerate a reduction from 21% to 16% without ill effects]]. The concentration of methane at which asphyxiation risk becomes significant is much higher than the 5\u201315% concentration in a flammable or explosive mixture. Methane off-gas can penetrate the interiors of buildings near [[landfills]] and expose occupants to significant levels of methane. Some buildings have specially engineered recovery systems below their basements to actively capture this gas and vent it away from the building.\n\nMethane gas explosions are responsible for many deadly mining disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mining.about.com/od/Accidents/a/Common-Mining-Accidents.htm|title=Common Mining Accidents|author=Dozolme, Philippe |publisher=About.com}}</ref> A methane gas explosion was the cause of the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster|Upper Big Branch coal mine disaster]] in [[West Virginia]] on April 5, 2010, killing 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_mine_explosion|author1=Lawrence Messina  |author2=Greg Bluestein |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Fed official: Still too soon for W.Va. mine rescue|publisher=News.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2010 |accessdate=April 8, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=}}\n* [[2007 Zasyadko mine disaster]]\n* [[Abiogenic petroleum origin]]\n* [[Aerobic methane production]]\n* [[Anaerobic digestion]]\n* [[Anaerobic respiration]]\n* [[Arctic methane emissions]]\n* [[Atmospheric methane]]\n* [[Biogas]]\n* [[Coal Oil Point seep field]]\n* [[Energy density]]\n* [[Fugitive gas emissions]]\n* [[Gas]]\n* [[Global Methane Initiative]]\n* [[Global warming]]\n* [[Greenhouse gas]]\n* [[Halomethane]], halogenated methane derivatives.\n* [[Hydrogen cycle|Hydrogen Cycle]]\n* [[Industrial gas]]\n* [[Lake Kivu]] (more general: [[limnic eruption]])\n* [[List of straight-chain alkanes]]\n* [[Methanation]]\n* [[Methane clathrate]], ice that contains methane.\n* [[Methane (data page)]]\n* [[Methane emissions]]\n* Methane on Mars: [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|atmosphere]]\n* Methane on Mars: [[Climate of Mars#Methane presence|climate]]\n* [[Methanogen]], [[archaea]] that produce methane.\n* [[Methanogenesis]], [[microbes]] that produce methane.\n* [[Methanotroph]], [[bacteria]] that grow with methane.\n* [[Methyl group]], a functional group related to methane.\n* [[Thomas Gold]]{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes\n| notes = {{efn |name=serpentinization |There are many [[serpentinite|''serpentinization'']] reactions.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, it may not refer to the origin of the name ''Arthur'', as ''Art\u014drius'' would regularly become ''Art(h)ur'' when borrowed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{citation |last=Koch |first=John T. |chapter=The Celtic Lands |editor-first=Norris J. |editor-last=Lacy |title = Medieval Arthurian Literature: A Guide to Recent Research |location = New York, NY |publisher = Garland |year= 1996 |page = 253 |isbn = 978-0-8153-2160-6 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] argued that the appearance of the name ''Arthur'' among Scottish and Welsh figures suggests the name became popular in early 6th-century Britain for a short time.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]].

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C.

New York: Garland, 2000.</ref> Littleton and Malcor argued that Artorius and the Sarmatian cavalry were the inspiration for King Arthur and his knights, but that many elements of Arthur's story derive from [[Mythology of the Caucasus|Caucasian mythology]], ostensibly brought to Britain in the 2nd century by Sarmatians and [[Alans]]. They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century. This is the solution proposed by David F. Carroll (in his book ''Arturius: A Quest for Camelot'', 1996) and by [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last = Wood |first = Michael |title = In Search of Myths and Heroes |page = [https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 255] |year = 2007 |publisher = University of California Press |isbn = 978-0-520-25170-0 |url = https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[King Arthur's messianic return]]\n* [[Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} For example, Art\u00far mac Conaing,<ref>Senchus Fer Alban.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]].

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{efn|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]].

After Murtaugh discovers that his close friend from the Vietnam War, Michael Hunsaker, has been laundering the profits from a [[heroin]]-trafficking [[drug cartel|cartel]], he confronts Hunsaker and learns the details of the organization before Mr. Joshua, the cartel's primary henchman, assassinates Hunsaker.  The cartel kidnaps Murtaugh's older daughter, Rianne, in an attempt to make Murtaugh reveal what Hunsaker told him.  Murtaugh and Riggs plan an ambush, which fails.  The cartel tortures Murtaugh, and threatens to torture Rianne as well, until Riggs rescues them.  He manages to kill General McAllister, the head of the cartel, by shooting the driver of his car, causing a bus-versus-car crash and a gigantic explosion. He supports Riggs as he fights and arrests Mr. Joshua, and then he and Riggs kill Joshua when he attempts to shoot Riggs. By the end of the film, he has forgone retirement and accepted Riggs into his family.\n\n==''Lethal Weapon 2'' (1989)==\nMurtaugh is targeted by a South African gang [[drug cartel]] fronted by ruthless diplomat Arjen Rudd, who has Murtaugh and his wife assaulted in their own home, forcing Murtaugh to temporarily move his family out. To assist Riggs' investigation of the South African consulate, Murtaugh portrays a man named Alphonse who wants to emigrate to South Africa to help overthrow [[apartheid]]. Following this, Murtaugh fights off two attackers in his home with a [[nail gun]] and rescues new friend Leo Getz ([[Joe Pesci]]), a federal witness, from the cartel.  He helps Riggs track down and kill the other members of the cartel when it is revealed that the cartel murdered Riggs' wife.  This includes an assault on a cargo ship which ends in the death of the remaining members of the cartel, including Rudd, whom Murtaugh kills after he shoots Riggs.\n\n==''Lethal Weapon 3'' (1992)==\nMurtaugh and Riggs mishandle a [[car bomb]], which destroys a building. As punishment, both are demoted to patrolman, but earn their previous rank when they foil an [[Armored car (military)|armored car]] robbery and expose a [[Arms trafficking|gun running]] cartel. While investigating this cartel, Murtaugh kills a fifteen-year-old boy to protect Riggs; the boy is revealed to be Darryl, the best friend of Murtaugh's son Nick. Murtaugh is overcome by [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and succumbs to [[alcoholism]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] until Riggs helps him move on. Murtaugh works with Riggs and [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] officer Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo]]) to destroy the cartel. As a comical sidelight, Murtaugh also helps Riggs [[Smoking cessation|quit smoking]] by giving him dog biscuits instead; he does show some hostility towards Riggs, however, when he believes that Riggs is becoming romantically involved with his daughter Rianne. However, Riggs opens up to him, admitting that he sees Murtaugh's family like his own family, the kids like his own children. In the midst of it all, Murtaugh enlists the help of Getz to sell his house, but in the end decides to keep the house when he decides not to retire.\n\n==''Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998)==\nWhen the city loses its insurance carrier due to all the property damage that Riggs and Murtaugh have caused on the job, they are temporarily promoted to [[Police captain|Captain]] in hopes of keeping them off the street. Their status as veteran officers keeps them from being disciplined or fired, and there are no open lieutenant slots available. By the end of the film, their sergeant's ranks are restored due to the city now being [[self-insured]]. Murtaugh's oldest daughter Rianne is pregnant with his first grandchild and is secretly married to LAPD Sergeant Lee Butters ([[Chris Rock]]), but she decides not to tell her father until after the baby is born because she went against his wishes of marrying a police officer. However, prior to finding out, Murtaugh mistakenly thought that Butters was [[Homosexuality|gay]] and attracted to him, because of all the nice things he was trying to do for Murtaugh, which was actually intended for him to stay on his father-in-law's good side (which Riggs helped exploit this misconception after he learned the truth from Lorna). Later, Murtaugh hits Riggs for not telling him about Rianne and Butters (Riggs and Butters blurt out the truth after being exposed to [[nitrous oxide]]) after [[Interrogation|interrogating]] Uncle Benny ([[Kim Chan]]). When Murtaugh accidentally kills the brother of Triad enforcer Wah Sing Ku ([[Jet Li]]), Riggs and Murtaugh engage in an intense physical altercation with Ku, resulting in Ku's death and Riggs being crushed beneath rubble underwater. Murtaugh rescues Riggs, and the two celebrate Rianne's marriage to Butters and the birth of their daughter, joined by Lorna, Leo Getz, and the rest of Murtaugh's family in the hospital.\n\n==Weapons==\nIn all four films Murtaugh's signature weapon is a 4\" [[Smith & Wesson Model 19]] .357 Magnum revolver which Riggs calls a \"Six-shooter...A lot of old-timers carry those\". In movies 2-4, he also uses a [[Smith & Wesson Model 5906]] 9mm pistol as a backup gun.\n\n==In popular culture==\nMurtaugh's [[catchphrase]] \"I'm too old for this shit\" has become associated with Glover, who uses the catchphrase (and variations of it) in other roles as well, such as his role as the patriarch in ''[[Almost Christmas (film)|Almost Christmas]],'' a cameo in ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' and his guest spot on ''[[Psych]]''. In the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' episode \"[[Murtaugh (How I Met Your Mother)|Murtaugh]]\", [[Ted Mosby]], portrayed by [[Josh Radnor]], has a \"Murtaugh List\" of things which he has gotten too old to eat, do, and enjoy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zoromski|first=Michelle|title= How I Met Your Mother: ''Murtaugh'' Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=March 31, 2009|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/31/how-i-met-your-mother-murtaugh-review|accessdate=February 28, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn the season 7 episode 'Ransom' of NBC's [[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]], Captain [[Raymond Holt]], played by [[Andre Braugher]], claims that a movie was made on his crazy life back in the 80's.

He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of [[Peter Gabriel]]. Collins began a solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of [[soul music]], releasing a series of successful albums, including ''[[Face Value (album)|Face Value]]'' (1981), ''[[No Jacket Required]]'' (1985), and ''[[...But Seriously]]'' (1989).
