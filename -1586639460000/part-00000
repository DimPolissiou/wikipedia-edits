All [[dune]] systems on the western side of the [[island]] and the large [[coastal plain]]s on both the northern and southern points of the island are part of the park. The park covers approximately {{convert|43|km2|abbr=on}} and attained national park status in 2002. The [[visitor center]] is located in the [[list of natural history museums|natural history museum]] {{ill|Ecomare|nl}}.\n\nIn 1927 [[botany|botanist]] [[Jac. P. Thijsse]] made an illustrated book about the flora and fauna on the island, and pointed out the major environmental values of the island. This book was one of a series, the book was sold very cheaply, and the pictures for the book came free with each [[Verkade]] chocolate bar.<ref>{{cite book | last=Thijsse | first =Jac. P. | last2=Thijsse | first2= | title=Texel | publisher=Verkade | year=1927}}</ref>\n\nThere are many [[trail|walking trails]] which follow either red, yellow, blue or green signs\nThe green routes are not accessible during the bird breeding season. Many [[trail|bicycle trails]] cross the park as well.\n\n==Areas==\n[[File:Texel-Sanddorn.jpg|thumb|Sea-Buckthorn near Ecomare]]\n\nFrom south to north the park comprises the following areas:\n*De Hors\n*De Geul\n*De Mok\n*De Bollekamer\n*De Westerduinen\n*De Dennen\n*Het Duinpark\n*Calniforni\u00eb-bos\n*De Seetingsnollen\n*Camping Kogerstrand\n*De Muy\n*De Slufter\n*De Haneplas\n*Krimbos\n*Eijerlandse Duinen\n*Camping de Robbejager\n\n===De Hors===\n''The Hors'' is at the most southerly point of Texel and is largely owned by the [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Defence]]. The terrain is used for [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] training. The defense complex build on the ''Mok bay'' is called ''de Mok''. The southern part of the Hors is a large [[coastal plain]] which was formed because in the past [[shoal]]s \"walked\" toward the island, the last shoal to do so was ''Onrust'' in 1910.\n\nOn the plains new [[dune]]s are being formed. On the newest dunes \"biestarwegras\" (''[[Elytrigia juncea]]'' subsp. ''boreoatlantica'') is found, and on the somewhat older dunes you will find [[marram grass]]. In the moist dune valleys [[Parnassia palustris|Parnassia]], [[Dactylorhiza incarnata|Dactylorhiza]] and [[Centaurium]] have sprung.\n\nThe ''Kreeftenpolder'' is a dune valley which was formed because a sandbar was built separating it from the coastal plain. The supervisor of the project, Jaap Kreeft gave the [[polder]] its name. In the valley the ''[[Liparis loeselii]]'' and the \"armbloemige waterbies\" (''[[Eleocharis quinqueflora]]'') grow. Since the year 2000 a large part of it is flooded. On the other side of the sandbar two small [[lake]]s have formed, the ''Horsmeertjes''.\n\n===De Geul===\n''The Geul'' is a wet dune valley, originally it was part of ''Mok bay'', but a [[dam]] was built so that [[drinking water]] could be extracted from the dunes. Here the largest colony on Texel of [[common spoonbill]] breeds. After the extraction of water stopped in 1993 the area became much wetter. Through a [[ditch]] with [[fish ladders]], water can escape to ''the Mok'', and [[three-spined stickleback]] can enter ''the Geul'' from the [[Wadden Sea]]. The presence of these fish made the spoonbills decide to breed here. Both [[highland cattle]] and [[Exmoor pony|Exmoor ponies]] graze in the area.\n\n===De Bollekamer===\n''The Bollekamer'' is situated between beach poles 9 and 12, north of [[Den Hoorn (North Holland)|Den Hoorn]]. In the eastern part rocky [[loam]] is found very near the surface, this surface does not let water through, therefore this area has the highest [[groundwater]] level of the entire dune system. The valleys are influenced by the [[lime (mineral)|lime]] rich groundwater. [[Highland cattle]] graze on ''the Bollekamer''.\n\n[[File:Muy vegetatie.jpg|left|thumb|Vegetation in ''De Nederlanden'' end of May]]\n\n===De Muy===\n''The Muy'' is named after the dune lake that was formed when the [[North Sea]] broke through the outer dunes in 1851. This is the oldest known breeding spot for the spoonbill on Texel. In the 1990s the number of spoonbills decreased, while more breeding [[great cormorant]]s came to the area. ''De Nederlanden'' is also part of ''the Muy'', in a [[land improvement]] project [[pasture]]s were made. That area is now managed [[Extensive farming|extensively]]. Among other plants the [[Green-winged Orchid]] grows here.\n\n=== De Slufter ===\n[[File:De Slufter Texel.jpg|thumb|De Slufter]]\n\nThe main part of ''the Slufter'' is a wide dune valley which has an open connection to the [[North Sea]] through a hole in the outer dunes {{Interlanguage link multi|De Slufter|nl}}. At [[tide|high tide]] seawater streams into ''the Slufter'' though [[creek (tidal)|creeks]] and at low tide it streams out again. The large ''Sluftercreek'' at the beach is where the water comes through most the time. Over time the creek has moved in a northern direction. Because this creek was heavily damaging the dunes on the northern side in May 2004, intervention was needed. A new creek was constructed on the far most southern part of ''the Slufter'', and the old creek was closed up a week later. On an average high tide the seawater only gets into the creeks and small lakes, on an extreme high tide the larger part of ''the Slufter'' is inundated.\n\nThe vegetation consists largely of [[salt marsh]] plants. In June the area colors mainly purple because of the [[Sea-lavender]]. In October it is mainly red because of the [[Salicornia|Common glasswort]]. [[Sea-buckthorn]] also grows here.\n\nMany [[bird]]s visit ''the Slufter'' estuary. The [[common eider]] breeds here, the [[Common spoonbill|spoonbill]] comes to [[foraging|forage]] and a variety of [[wader]]s only enter on a high tide.\n\nMany [[seashells]] of the present sea fauna, as well as many [[fossil]] seashells dating back to the [[Eemian Stage]] wash on to the [[coastal plain]] of ''the Slufter''.\n\n''The Slufter'' is separated from the [[North Sea]] by two long dune strips, this area is called ''De Lange Dam''. In between the dune stripes there is a valley with fresh water, many [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] grow here.\n\n==Fauna==\n[[Texel]] has a very rich variety of species.\n\n===Birds===\nCommonly sighted [[bird]]s on the island are: [[greylag goose]], [[brent goose]], [[Common shelduck|shelduck]], [[wigeon]], [[Common eider|eider]], [[Common scoter|scoter]], [[Common spoonbill|spoonbill]], [[Eurasian oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], [[pied avocet]], [[Eurasian golden plover|golden plover]], [[Northern lapwing|peewit]], [[Red knot|knot]], [[dunlin]], [[bar-tailed godwit]], [[common pheasant]], [[european herring gull]], [[lesser black-backed gull]], [[black-headed gull]], [[common tern]], [[sandwich tern]], [[short-eared owl]] and the [[hen harrier]]. Many passerine birds make their home within the dunes, such as [[European starling|starling]], [[northern wheatear]], [[european stonechat]], [[whinchat]], [[white wagtail]], [[western yellow wagtail]] and [[meadow pipit]].\n\n===Mammals===\nWithin the dunes itself common mammals to be found are [[European rabbit|rabbits]], [[European hare | hares]], [[European hedgehog | hedgehogs]], various small rodents (mice, voles) and the [[stoat]]. The beaches, sandbanks and surrounding waters are home to two species of seal, [[common seal]] and [[grey seal]], as well as [[harbour porpoise | porpoises]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline}}\n* [http://www.npduinenvantexel.nl/index.php?id=59 Nationaal Park Duinen van Texel]\n* [http://waarneming.nl/gebied/species_list/22650?lang=en&local=nl A complete list of the avifauna of Texel (other species groups available as well)]\n\n{{National parks of the Netherlands}}\n\n[[Category:Texel]]\n[[Category:Parks in North Holland]]\n[[Category:National parks of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Dunes of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 2002]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Ramsar sites in the Netherlands]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name = Dunes of Texel National Park\n| alt_name = '''''Nationaal Park Duinen van Texel'''''\n| iucn_category = II\n| photo = Slufter2.jpg\n| photo_alt = The Slufter\n| photo_caption = The Slufter\n| photo_width = 288\n| map_image = NP-DunesTexelKaart.jpg\n| map_alt = Map of the National Park\n| map_caption = Map of the National Park\n| map_width = 192\n| location = [[North Holland]], [[Netherlands]]\n| nearest_city = \n| coords = {{coord|53|8|N|4|48|E|region:NL_type:landmark|display=inline,title}}\n| area = {{convert|43|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| established = {{start date|2002}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npduinenvantexel.nl/index.php?menuid=52|title=Nationaal Park Duinen van Texel|website=www.npduinenvantexel.nl}}</ref>\n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body = [[Staatsbosbeheer]] & [[Ministry of Defence (Netherlands)|Dutch Ministry of Defence]]\n| url = http://www.npduinenvantexel.nl/\n| embedded = {{Designation list\n| embed = yes\n| designation1 = Ramsar\n| designation1_offname = Duinen en Lage Land Texel\n| designation1_date = 29 August 2000\n| designation1_number = 2213<ref>{{Cite web|title=Duinen en Lage Land Texel|website=[[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] Sites Information Service|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2213|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>}}\n}}\n[[File:Texel-Alte D\u00fcnen.jpg|thumb|Texel Dunes]]\n'''Dunes of Texel National Park''' ({{lang-nl|Nationaal Park Duinen van Texel}}) is a [[national park]] located on the [[North-Holland]] island of [[Texel]] in the [[Netherlands]].

''Tung'' ({{zh|c=\u6771}}, meaning ''east'') is prepended to the name so as to avoid possible confusion with ''[[Peng Chau]]'', another island in Hong Kong with an identically pronounced name in the [[Cantonese language]]. Administratively, the island is part of the [[Tai Po District]] in the [[New Territories]].\n\n==Geography==\nGeographically, Ping Chau is an offshore island located in the northeast corner of Hong Kong in [[Mirs Bay]],<ref name=\"Marine Park\"/> close to the border with [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] in [[mainland China]]. The island has an area of 1.16&nbsp;km\u00b2<ref>Survey and Mapping Office, Lands Department: [http://www.landsd.gov.hk/mapping/en/publications/hk_geographic_data_sheet.pdf Hong Kong geographic data sheet]</ref> and consists of [[shale]] rock. The island is the most easterly point of the Hong Kong territory and is much closer to mainland China (4&nbsp;km) than to the main landmass of Hong Kong. It is close to [[Nan'ao Subdistrict|Nan'ao]] of [[Dapeng Peninsula|Dapeng]].\n\nThe island has the shape of a [[kidney bean]] with its concave side facing northeast.

In contrast, the western coast of the island is fairly rocky as a result of the greater wave action taking its toll on the inclined [[siltstone]] there.\n\nThe island's largest village, Sha Tau (\u6c99\u982d), is something of a ghost town, with many cottages boarded up.

Hong Kong is mostly formed of extrusive [[igneous rock]]s, after a series of major [[volcano]]es erupted during the [[Jurassic Period]]. Following the volcanic activity, a basin formed in the northeast, with deposition in a brackish lake\u2014producing the [[siltstone]]s and [[chert]] of Tung Ping Chau, which have been dated from the early [[Paleogene]] period. It is also home to some spectacular cliffs and [[wave-cut platform]]s. Landforms such as these are very rarely found in the rest of Hong Kong.\n\nCham Keng Chau (\u65ac\u9838\u6d32, \"Chop Neck Islet\"), in the northwest, is a chunk of land that has broken away from the island;<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/photos/travelhaha/5153422594/ \"Corridor of Cham Keng Chau\"]</ref> the Chinese say it represents the head of a dragon.<ref name=\"island_hopping\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/hong-kong/feature_30004.html |title=Hong Kong Island Hopping |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206122550/http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/hong-kong/feature_30004.html |archivedate=6 February 2009 }}</ref> Another notable rock formation is Lung Lok Shui (\u9f8d\u843d\u6c34, \"Dragon Descend into Water\"), on the southwestern coast, thus named because it resembles the spine of a dragon entering the sea.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> At the island's southeastern end are two large rocks known as the Drum Rocks, or Kang Lau Shek (\u66f4\u6a13\u77f3, \"Watchman's Tower Rocks\").<ref name=\"island_hopping\"/> They are {{convert|7|to|8|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Stack (geology)|sea stacks]] on a wave-cut platform.<ref name=\"Plover Cove (Ext.)\"/> Lan Kwo Shui (\u96e3\u904e\u6c34, \"Difficult-to-cross Waters\") features a long vertical cliff located along the southern coast, where several caves were formed there as a result of long term wave actions.

Nowadays no longer spoken by many, you may still hear this dialect in the conversations between the villagers inside the restaurants.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe island has a temple dedicated to [[Tin Hau temples in Hong Kong|Tin Hau]], built in 1765,<ref name=\"item 1022\"/> and a temple dedicated to [[Tam Kung]]: the Tam Tai Sin Temple (\u8b5a\u5927\u4ed9\u5edf), built before 1877.<ref name=\"item 800\"/> Both temples are located in the village of Sha Tau. Several other old buildings can be found on the island. On one side of the island there are steep cliffs, below which is an amazing [[wave-cut platform]], with jagged rocks, set at a 30-degree angle, like a staircase. Here there are many rock pools containing all manner of marine life, such as [[sea urchin]]s and crabs. On the island's coastline at the pier side, there are over 60 different species of [[coral]], and 35 species of [[algae]].\n\nDuring the weekends, many people visit the island. These include those who have come to dive, and those who have come to see the cliffs and wave-cut platforms. Some people also use it as a weekend home. 57,000 people visited Ping Chau in 2005.<ref name=\"Out of sight\"/>\n\nThere is a camping site as well as picnic and barbecue sites on the island, managed by the [[Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department]].<ref>[[Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department|AFCD]]: [http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cam/cou_vis_cam_cam/cou_vis_cam_cam_5.html Tung Ping Chau Campsite] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231163440/http://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/country/cou_vis/cou_vis_cam/cou_vis_cam_cam/cou_vis_cam_cam_5.html |date=31 December 2015 }}</ref> A few basic restaurants can be found at Tai Tong, a short distance north of Tung Ping Chau Public Pier.

Lectures started here in 1974]]\nMaastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the [[Mining in Limburg|Limburg coal mining industry]].<ref name=\"zicht1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl/tekst/onderwerpen/universiteit|title=Universiteit|publisher=Zicht op Maastricht|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of [[Problem Based Learning|problem-based learning]]. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch Parliament]] eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.<ref>''Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'' (\"State Journal of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\"), 1975, p.717.</ref> The new university, named ''Rijksuniversiteit Limburg'' (State University of Limburg), was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]]. Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.\n\nSoon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The Faculty of Law was created in 1981, followed by the Faculty of Economics in 1984. In 1994, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and one year later the Faculty of Psychology were established. The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the Department of Knowledge Engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance.  Together with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.<ref>Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004 310 9}}</ref>\n\nThe university was renamed ''Universiteit Maastricht'' in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.\n\n=== 2019 cyber attack ===\nOn December 23rd, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a ransomware attack. The ransomware encrypted all major software used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A ransom was set from the offenders, which, if paid on time, would allow a decryption of the University systems. The lessons resumed with no delays on the 6th of January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Campuses==\nMaastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.\n\n===City Centre Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht-Universiteitsbibliotheek aan de Grote Looiersstraat.jpg|thumb|Former poorhouse at Grote Looiersstraat, part of the inner city library]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Universiteitsbibliotheek Binnenstad2.jpg|thumb|University library, south entrance at Nieuwenhofstraat]]\n\nThe university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht's city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht's historic city centre.<ref name=\"Beijer, Hans 2006\">Beijer, Hans et al. (2006). ''MonUMent'', published to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Maastricht University.</ref>\n\n====University buildings in Jekerkwartier====\nThe first building that was obtained by the university was the former [[Jesuit]] monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the Faculty of Medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (''mensa'' in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect [[Jo Coenen]].\n\nThe Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as ''Oud Gouvernement'' in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river [[Meuse]] in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies ''Slijpe Court'', a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.\n\nThe university's administrative headquarters is located at ''Minderbroedersberg'', in a former [[Franciscan]] monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its ''Aula'' (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the ''Bonnefanten'', now the university's Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from [[Li\u00e8ge]] who were referred to as \"''bons enfants''\", \"good children\". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, [[Bonnefantenmuseum]]. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's [[poor house]] and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.\n\n[[University College Maastricht]] is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century [[b\u00e9guinage]], named ''Nieuwenhof''. [[Maastricht Science College]] has its new home since 2012 in the renovated ''Hustinx Mansion'' in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa\u00e7ade and a courtyard that is now covered.\n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 20100513.jpg|Tongersestraat, School of Economics\nFile:Gouvernement Bouillonstraat Bremer Maastricht.jpg|Bouillonstraat: Faculty of Law\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 26821 - Bouillonstraat 8 20100514.jpg|Bouillonstraat,  Knowledge Engineering\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506711 - Kapoenstraat 2 20100703.jpg|Kapoenstraat, Science Programme\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, Hof van Tilly04.jpg|thumb|Entrance Faculty of Arts at ''Tilly Court'']]\n\n====University buildings elsewhere in the city centre====\nSeveral other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. In Abtstraat, close to Jekerkwartier, UM owns two buildings that are used both by the faculties of law and economics. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. ''Soiron Mansion'', built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Saint Servatius Church]], the former Ursuline school buildings and ''Tilly Court'', built for the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century. \n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506609 - Gasthuis Calvarienberg - Abtstraat 2a 20100513.jpg|Abtstraat, ''Calvari\u00ebnberg''\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27014 - Grote Gracht 82 20100718.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Soiron Mansion'', Faculty of Arts\nFile:GroteGracht37.jpg|Grote Gracht, Ursuline School, Faculty of Arts\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27017 - Hof van Tilly - Grote Gracht 90-92 20100516.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Tilly Court'', Faculty of Arts\n</gallery>\n\n===Randwyck Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht University - Campus Randwyck.jpg|thumb|Campus Randwyck buildings: Life Sciences]]\nThe Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck.\n\nThe focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, local [[Public housing#Netherlands|housing association]] Servatius started construction of the ambitious campus project 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital. The costly project, designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space. The project was canceled by Servatius because the costs were unrealistic.\n<gallery>\nFile:Exterieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Maastricht, locatie Randwyck.jpg|Faculty of Medicine\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, AZM04.jpg|University hospital\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, UM building1.jpg|Peter Debyeplein 1\nFile:Interieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Randwyck.JPG|Randwyck library\n</gallery>\n\n===Satellite campuses===\nIn recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of [[Venlo]], the Belgian capital of [[Brussels]] and the city of [[Bangalore, India]].\n\nThe [[Maastricht University, Campus Venlo]] is located in the renovated \"Raad van Arbeid\" building at Nassaustraat, close to the center of [[Venlo]].

The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the Faculty of Health Sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in [[healthcare science]]s, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.\n\nThe two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (''Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht'' or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).\n\n==== Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience ====\nFounded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: [[cognitive psychology]] and [[biological psychology]].

The one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in [[neuropsychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and [[organisational psychology]]. In conjunction with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and [[psychopathology]]. The selective two-year master programme [[Forensic Psychology]] in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure \u2013 including hypermodern high field MRI scanners \u2013 allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.\n\n[[File:University building.JPG|thumb|School of Business and Economics, Tongersestraat]]\n\n==== School of Business and Economics ====\n\nThe School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984.<ref>Hein Schreuder, Economics in Maastricht had to be intimidatingly different, more international and better, in: Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004310 9}}</ref> It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers.

Ninety students enrolled in the first year. In the 1990s, the faculty introduced a new programme entitled the European Law School (ELS), which focused on European, comparative and international law. The programme was taught partly in English. A fully English-language ELS programme was established in 2007. It was the first English-language bachelor's programme in law in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"History\"/> The faculty currently consists of about 2,500 students and 150 members of staff.

According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|title=Problem-Based Learning|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121836/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|archivedate=2010-01-13}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} In 1974, Maastricht's newly established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.\n\nAt the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\"/> A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|title=Tutorial groups|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101702/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|archivedate=2009-09-30}}</ref> A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|title=Tutors|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002012944/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref> plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.\n\nEven though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observantonline.nl/Artikelen/tabid/69/agentType/View/PropertyID/316/Default.aspx|title=How to survive Maastricht|publisher=Observant|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Rankings and reputation ===\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 201-300<small> (2019)</small> | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|website=ShanghaiRanking|accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 127<small> (2020)</small> | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Maastricht University|date=September 9, 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 239<small> (2020)</small> | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=June 5, 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 196<small> (2020)</small> | USNWR_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=20|title=U.S. News Education: Best Global Universities 2020}}</ref>\n| Leiden_W = 243<small> (2019)</small> | Leiden_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2019/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019|website=|accessdate=2019-11-21|publisher=}}</ref>\n| QS_Under50 = 23<small> (2020)</small> | QS_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\" />\n| THE_Under50 = 10<small> (2019)</small> | THE_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\" />\n}}\nAccording to ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2016'', Maastricht University occupied 88th (127th as of 2020) position in the world rank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Maastricht University|date=2020-02-04|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>  \n[[QS World University Rankings]] 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' (or ''Shanghai Ranking'') counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.\n\nIn the ''[[QS World University Rankings#QS Top 50 under 50|QS Top 50 Under 50]]'', which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 23rd place in 2020.<ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/top-50-under-50-next-50-under-50/qs-top-50-under-50-2020|title=QS Top 50 Under 50 2020 - Top Universities|date=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar list published by Times Higher Education (''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings#THE 100 under 50 universities|THE 100 Under 50 universities]] 2019''), Maastricht University was placed at the 10th in the world.<ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-young-universities-world|title=Best young universities in the world 2019 |author=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Financial Times]]'', places the School of Business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.\n\nThe School of Business and Economics has been awarded the '[[Triple accreditation]]' by the prestigious [[AACSB]], [[EQUIS]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\n=== Research ===\n[[File:Promotie Maastricht.jpg|thumb|Ph.D. conferral at UM]]\nResearch at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World. Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the [[European integration]] process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\nA noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk moved to Maastricht University in February 2014. His presence fits in the large investment programme ''Kennis-As Limburg'', that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy.

In 2013, Maastricht University was the second Dutch university to be rewarded the \u2018Distinctive Quality Feature for Internationalisation\u2019 by the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders (NVAO).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Tans, J.G.H. - SFA002019729.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Sjeng Tans, founder of UM]]\n[[File:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 poort 20100513.jpg|thumb|Gate of former Jesuit monastery. Lectures started here in 1974]]\nMaastricht University was officially established in 1976. Faced with a shortage of medical professionals, the Dutch government decided in the late 1960s that a new public institution of higher education was needed in order to expand the country's medical training facilities. Political leaders in the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], most notably Sjeng Tans, the chairman of the [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|Labour Party]] and former member of the Limburg provincial council and Maastricht city council, successfully lobbied for the new medical school to be established in Maastricht. This academic institution would be vital to sustain the intellectual life of the city, and indeed the whole province. Moreover, it was argued that the establishment of a university in Maastricht could contribute to the government's restructuring efforts in this part of the Netherlands, which was experiencing economic challenges following the collapse of the [[Mining in Limburg|Limburg coal mining industry]].<ref name=\"zicht1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zichtopmaastricht.nl/tekst/onderwerpen/universiteit|title=Universiteit|publisher=Zicht op Maastricht|accessdate=2009-12-31}}</ref>\n\nThe newly established school chose not to await official recognition but to start its educational programme in September 1974, adopting an innovative approach to academic education in the form of [[Problem Based Learning|problem-based learning]]. About 50 students enrolled in the first academic year. By the end of 1975, the [[States General of the Netherlands|Dutch Parliament]] eventually passed the statute needed for the institution to acquire national educational funds and to be able to award academic degrees.<ref>''Staatsblad van het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden'' (\"State Journal of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\"), 1975, p.717.</ref> The new university, named ''Rijksuniversiteit Limburg'' (State University of Limburg), was officially established on the 9th of January 1976, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] signed the university's founding charter at a ceremony in the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]]. Sjeng Tans became the university's first president.\n\nSoon after its establishment, the university gained political support to increase its funding and to expand into other academic fields. The Faculty of Law was created in 1981, followed by the Faculty of Economics in 1984. In 1994, the Faculty of Arts and Culture and one year later the Faculty of Psychology were established. The Faculty of Humanities and Sciences started in 2005, containing a variety of organisational units, such as the Department of Knowledge Engineering and the Maastricht Graduate School of Governance.  Together with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences (established in 2007 as a merger between the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Medicine) Maastricht University currently has six faculties.<ref>Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004 310 9}}</ref>\n\nThe university was renamed ''Universiteit Maastricht'' in 1996 and added its English-language name in 2008. As of 2010, Maastricht University consists of six faculties offering 17 bachelor programmes, 56 master programmes and several Ph.D. programmes.\n\n=== 2019 cyber attack ===\nOn December 23rd, Maastricht University suffered a major cyber-attack, more specifically a ransomware attack. The ransomware encrypted all major software used by Maastricht University, making it impossible for students and staff members to access any university online services during the Christmas break. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A ransom was set from the offenders, which, if paid on time, would allow a decryption of the University systems. The lessons resumed with no delays on the 6th of January, with most online services again available to both students and staff members. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Campuses==\nMaastricht University is located in buildings in two separate locations in Maastricht. The arts, humanities and social science departments are housed in a number of historic buildings in the city center, while psychology, the medical and life sciences are based in the modern Randwyck campus on the outskirts of the city.\n\n===City Centre Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht-Universiteitsbibliotheek aan de Grote Looiersstraat.jpg|thumb|Former poorhouse at Grote Looiersstraat, part of the inner city library]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Universiteitsbibliotheek Binnenstad2.jpg|thumb|University library, south entrance at Nieuwenhofstraat]]\n\nThe university's arts, humanities and social sciences faculties are located in Maastricht's city centre, west of the river Meuse. Most of the university's inner city properties have official monumental status. As many of these buildings were facing abandonment at the time of their acquirement, the development of an urban university campus has contributed to the preservation and liveliness of Maastricht's historic city centre.<ref name=\"Beijer, Hans 2006\">Beijer, Hans et al. (2006). ''MonUMent'', published to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Maastricht University.</ref>\n\n====University buildings in Jekerkwartier====\nThe first building that was obtained by the university was the former [[Jesuit]] monastery and seminary at Tongersestraat, largely dating from the 1930s. Here, in 1974 the newly established medical school started. After the Faculty of Medicine moved to premises closer to the newly constructed university hospital, the Jesuit monastery became home to the Faculty of Economy, which is now the university's largest academic unit in terms of student numbers. The building was expanded in the 1990s to include the university restaurant (''mensa'' in Dutch) and a large lecture hall designed by Dutch architect [[Jo Coenen]].\n\nThe Faculty of Law is housed in the building known as ''Oud Gouvernement'' in Bouillonstraat, which was completed in 1935 as the provincial government building. It was acquired by the UM in 1986 after the provincial government had moved to its new premises on the river [[Meuse]] in the southeastern part of the city. Opposite lies ''Slijpe Court'', a 17th-century mansion that in 2002 was refurbished to house the Department of Knowledge Engineering of the Faculty of Humanities and Science.\n\nThe university's administrative headquarters is located at ''Minderbroedersberg'', in a former [[Franciscan]] monastery, which dates back to 1699 and was later used as a court house and prison. The UM acquired the building in order to make it their administrative center in 1999. The Minderbroedersberg, with its ''Aula'' (main hall), also serves as the university's primary location for official academic ceremonies, such as Ph.D. conferrals.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill lies the former convent of the ''Bonnefanten'', now the university's Student Service Center, as well as a visitor center, including a gift shop. This building, which dates back to 1627, served as a convent for nuns originally from [[Li\u00e8ge]] who were referred to as \"''bons enfants''\", \"good children\". In the twentieth century, the city's art museum was established here and later took its name from the building, [[Bonnefantenmuseum]]. In 1979 the building became the main branch of the university library, until the library moved to its current location. The oldest part of the library building at Grote Looiersstraat was constructed in 1755 and served as the city's [[poor house]] and military hospital. In the 1970s, the city's public library was built in the garden. In 1999 the city library moved to its current location at Centre Ceramique. The old library was then acquired by the UM. After major renovation and expansion works, the university library relocated here in 2003.\n\n[[University College Maastricht]] is located at Zwingelput in a 15th-century [[b\u00e9guinage]], named ''Nieuwenhof''. [[Maastricht Science College]] has its new home since 2012 in the renovated ''Hustinx Mansion'' in Kapoenstraat, which has a richly ornamented fa\u00e7ade and a courtyard that is now covered.\n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27665 - Tongersestraat 53 20100513.jpg|Tongersestraat, School of Economics\nFile:Gouvernement Bouillonstraat Bremer Maastricht.jpg|Bouillonstraat: Faculty of Law\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 26821 - Bouillonstraat 8 20100514.jpg|Bouillonstraat,  Knowledge Engineering\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506711 - Kapoenstraat 2 20100703.jpg|Kapoenstraat, Science Programme\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Maastricht, GroteGracht, Hof van Tilly04.jpg|thumb|Entrance Faculty of Arts at ''Tilly Court'']]\n\n====University buildings elsewhere in the city centre====\nSeveral other university institutions are housed in buildings elsewhere in the city centre. In Abtstraat, close to Jekerkwartier, UM owns two buildings that are used both by the faculties of law and economics. The UM Language Centre is based in an old canon's house at Sint Servaasklooster. The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences currently occupies three adjacent buildings on Grote Gracht. ''Soiron Mansion'', built by the architect Matthias Soiron for his two brothers, canons of [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|Saint Servatius Church]], the former Ursuline school buildings and ''Tilly Court'', built for the military governor of Maastricht, both date from the 18th century. \n<gallery>\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 506609 - Gasthuis Calvarienberg - Abtstraat 2a 20100513.jpg|Abtstraat, ''Calvari\u00ebnberg''\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27014 - Grote Gracht 82 20100718.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Soiron Mansion'', Faculty of Arts\nFile:GroteGracht37.jpg|Grote Gracht, Ursuline School, Faculty of Arts\nFile:Maastricht - rijksmonument 27017 - Hof van Tilly - Grote Gracht 90-92 20100516.jpg|Grote Gracht, ''Tilly Court'', Faculty of Arts\n</gallery>\n\n===Randwyck Campus===\n[[File:Maastricht University - Campus Randwyck.jpg|thumb|Campus Randwyck buildings: Life Sciences]]\nThe Randwyck campus was developed from the 1970s onwards and has become the center for the university's psychology, health, medicine and  life science activities. Here, plans for the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus are aimed at strengthening the scientific and economic impact of Randwyck.\n\nThe focal point for the Randwyck campus is the academic hospital (azM), which moved here from its original location on the West bank of the Meuse river in 1992. Some of university buildings are physically connected to the hospital, built in the 1990s. The university and the AZM work together in the Maastricht University Medical Center+, established in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, local [[Public housing#Netherlands|housing association]] Servatius started construction of the ambitious campus project 'Campus Maastricht', to be built at a site near the university hospital. The costly project, designed by Spanish architect [[Santiago Calatrava]], would provide for an athletic centre, student housing, guesthouses, retail facilities and office space. The project was canceled by Servatius because the costs were unrealistic.\n<gallery>\nFile:Exterieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Maastricht, locatie Randwyck.jpg|Faculty of Medicine\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, AZM04.jpg|University hospital\nFile:Maastricht, Randwyck, UM building1.jpg|Peter Debyeplein 1\nFile:Interieur Universiteitsbibliotheek Randwyck.JPG|Randwyck library\n</gallery>\n\n===Satellite campuses===\nIn recent years, the university has opened offices in the northern Limburg city of [[Venlo]], the Belgian capital of [[Brussels]] and the city of [[Bangalore, India]].\n\nThe [[Maastricht University, Campus Venlo]] is located in the renovated \"Raad van Arbeid\" building at Nassaustraat, close to the center of [[Venlo]].

The latter was the first faculty to be established at Maastricht University. In 1980 the Faculty of Health Sciences was founded. The broad range of disciplines it offered in [[healthcare science]]s, made the faculty unique, not only in the Netherlands, but also in Europe. The format allowed students to integrate their discipline and research work into all areas related to society, health and disease. A one-year master's program in global health is available.\n\nThe two united faculties have developed into a community of approximately 1950 students, with a staff of around 1200 (academics, administrative and support staff). Since 1992 staff and students are based in the Randwyck district, near the University Hospital (''Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht'' or AZM) which opened in 1991. The AZM has been renamed MUMC+ (Maastrichts Universitair Medisch Centrum Plus).\n\n==== Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience ====\nFounded in 1995, the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience (FPN) is specialised in two contemporary approaches in psychology: [[cognitive psychology]] and [[biological psychology]]. It is home to around 1,500 students and 250 staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Faculty|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2013-07-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023005544/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Faculties/PsychologyAndNeuroscience/Theme/AboutTheFaculty.htm|archivedate=2013-10-23}}</ref> The faculty offers a Dutch and English bachelor's programme in psychology, two English-taught master's programmes and one research master's programme. The one-year master's programme in psychology offers specialisations in [[neuropsychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], health and social psychology, psychology and law, work and [[organisational psychology]]. In conjunction with the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences, the two-year research master Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience offers six different specialisations: cognitive neuroscience, fundamental neuroscience, neuropsychology, drug development and neurohealth, neuroeconomics and [[psychopathology]]. The selective two-year master programme [[Forensic Psychology]] in English, offers theoretical, research and skills courses, to educate students to become scientist-practitioners in the field of forensic psychology and psychiatry. The faculty's unique research infrastructure \u2013 including hypermodern high field MRI scanners \u2013 allows for groundbreaking research into the brain and behaviour.\n\n[[File:University building.JPG|thumb|School of Business and Economics, Tongersestraat]]\n\n==== School of Business and Economics ====\n\nThe School of Business and Economics (SBE) was founded in 1984.<ref>Hein Schreuder, Economics in Maastricht had to be intimidatingly different, more international and better, in: Annemieke Klijn, The Maastricht Experiment, 2016. {{ISBN|978 94 6004310 9}}</ref> It is currently the biggest faculty within UM in terms of student numbers.

According to its website, UM is the only university which applies the problem-based learning approach in all its educational programmes.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\">{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|title=Problem-Based Learning|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113121836/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Education/EducationalProfile/ProblemBasedLearning.htm|archivedate=2010-01-13}}</ref>{{third-party inline|date=June 2018}} In 1974, Maastricht's newly established Faculty of Medicine was only the second in the world to adopt the problem-based learning method. As PBL was originally designed for medical education, other faculties have developed a PBL approach that corresponds with the needs of their academic disciplines.\n\nAt the heart of Maastricht's PBL philosophy is the idea that students are personally responsible for their own academic education.<ref name=\"Problem-Based Learning\"/> A typical UM course revolves around so-called 'tutorial groups'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|title=Tutorial groups|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930101702/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/TutorialGroups.htm|archivedate=2009-09-30}}</ref> A tutorial group usually consists of 14 to 16 students, meeting once or twice a week to discuss self-identified problems on the basis of cases or situations described in the course manual. Each tutorial meeting consists of two parts: a post-discussion, where problems which have been identified at the previous session are discussed on the basis of assigned literature and sometimes with additional library research, followed by a pre-discussion of topics to be discussed at the next meeting. The tutorial group is chaired by a student member, who is expected to structure the discussion and ensure that every member of the group is able to participate. The instructor, typically named 'tutor',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|title=Tutors|publisher=Maastricht University|accessdate=2010-02-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002012944/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/ProspectiveStudents/BachelorsProgrammes/EducationalProfile/Tutors.htm|archivedate=2009-10-02}}</ref> plays only a limited role during tutorials. Tutors will monitor discussions, provide feedback, and, where needed, help students in identifying relevant problems. Courses usually take seven weeks of tutorials followed by a final exam, but may also include writing or speaking assignments.\n\nEven though traditional lecture-based teaching is at odds with the primarily self-guiding PBL approach, it has become customary in many programmes at Maastricht to include at least some lectures in courses to supplement the tutorial-based structure. Also, electronic learning methods are increasingly being used. As PBL courses are intensive, students can take only two or three courses at a time depending on the number of credit hours per course. The university's Language Centre offers an introduction to Maastricht's PBL approach for international students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.observantonline.nl/Artikelen/tabid/69/agentType/View/PropertyID/316/Default.aspx|title=How to survive Maastricht|publisher=Observant|date=2009-06-04|accessdate=2010-02-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Rankings and reputation ===\n{{Infobox European university ranking\n| ARWU_W = 201-300<small> (2019)</small> | ARWU_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shanghairanking.com/ARWU2019.html|title=Academic Ranking of World Universities 2019|website=ShanghaiRanking|accessdate=2019-08-17}}</ref>\n| THE_W = 127<small> (2020)</small> | THE_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/maastricht-university|title=Maastricht University|date=September 9, 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)}}</ref>\n| QS_W = 239<small> (2020)</small> | QS_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020|title=QS World University Rankings 2020|date=June 5, 2019|website=Top Universities}}</ref>\n| USNWR_W = 196<small> (2020)</small> | USNWR_W_ref = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/rankings?page=20|title=U.S. News Education: Best Global Universities 2020}}</ref>\n| Leiden_W = 243<small> (2019)</small> | Leiden_W_ref = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.leidenranking.com/ranking/2019/list|title=CWTS Leiden Ranking 2019|website=|accessdate=2019-11-21|publisher=}}</ref>\n| QS_Under50 = 23<small> (2020)</small> | QS_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\" />\n| THE_Under50 = 10<small> (2019)</small> | THE_Under50_ref = <ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\" />\n}}\nAccording to ''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]] 2016'', Maastricht University occupied 88th (127th as of 2020) position in the world rank.  \n[[QS World University Rankings]] 2017/18 ranked Maastricht University as the 200th best university in the world, while ''[[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]'' (or ''Shanghai Ranking'') counted Maastricht among the world's top 300 universities, since 2011.\n\nIn the ''[[QS World University Rankings#QS Top 50 under 50|QS Top 50 Under 50]]'', which ranks the top 50 universities under 50 years old around the world, UM reached the 23rd place in 2020.<ref name=\"QS top 50 under 50 2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings-articles/top-50-under-50-next-50-under-50/qs-top-50-under-50-2020|title=QS Top 50 Under 50 2020 - Top Universities|date=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar list published by Times Higher Education (''[[Times Higher Education World University Rankings#THE 100 under 50 universities|THE 100 Under 50 universities]] 2019''), Maastricht University was placed at the 10th in the world.<ref name=\"THE 100 under 50 2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/best-universities/best-young-universities-world|title=Best young universities in the world 2019 |author=Times Higher Education (THE)|date=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Financial Times]]'', places the School of Business and Economics at the 60th place in 2016.\n\nThe School of Business and Economics has been awarded the '[[Triple accreditation]]' by the prestigious [[AACSB]], [[EQUIS]] and [[Association of MBAs|AMBA]].\n\n=== Research ===\n[[File:Promotie Maastricht.jpg|thumb|Ph.D. conferral at UM]]\nResearch at Maastricht University concentrates on three major themes: Quality of Life, Learning and Innovation and Europe and a Globalising World. Examples of issues addressed through UM research are: healthy ageing, climate change, demographic changes, sustainability, the impact of technological developments, population ageing, healthy and affordable food, and the [[European integration]] process. A lot of this research is conducted in multidisciplinary teams and in institutes such as CARIM, the School for Cardiovascular Diseases.\n\nA noted research platform is Scannexus (formerly known as: Brains Unlimited): a scanning lab at the Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus, offering three MRI scanners with ultrahigh magnetic fields, including one of only four 9.4 Tesla scanners worldwide. Professor Rainer Goebel, director of the affiliated Maastricht Brain Imaging Centre (M-Bic), has been rewarded several large international research grants. The internationally renowned Tissue Regeneration group of Professor Clemens van Blitterswijk moved to Maastricht University in February 2014. His presence fits in the large investment programme ''Kennis-As Limburg'', that aims to strengthen the provincial knowledge economy. So does the Institute of Nanoscopy, led by Professor Peter Peters.\n\nIn 2011 the number of [[dissertations]] at the University of Maastricht had reached 213; the number of scientific publications 3,567.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/factsAndFigures.htm|title=Facts & figures|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012161159/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/factsAndFigures.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013}}</ref> Most [[PhD]] programmes take place in faculty research units (so-called [[graduate schools]]) or associated institutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/ResearchUM.htm|title=Research at UM|accessdate=31 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012222918/http://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/web/Main/Research1/ResearchUM.htm|archivedate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Research and graduate schools ====\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}\n* Research and graduate schools affiliated to the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences:\n** Netherlands School of Primary Care (CaRe)\n** School for Public Health and Primary Care (CAPHRI), linked to CaRe and WTMC\n** School for Cardiovascular Diseases (CARIM)\n** School for Oncology and Developmental Biology (GROW)\n** School of Nutrition and Translational Research in Metabolism (NUTRIM)\n** School of Health Professions Education (SHE), linked to ICO\n* Research and graduate schools of the Faculty of Psychology and Neuroscience:\n** Graduate School Psychology and Neuroscience (GSPN), linked to EPOS, EPP, EURON, Psychology and Health, and M-Bic\n** European Graduate School of Neuroscience (EURON)\n** School for Mental Health and Neuroscience (MHeNS), linked to EURON\n[[File:2016 Maastricht, Boschstraat, UNU-MERIT.jpg|thumb|[[UNU-MERIT]] at Boschstraat]]\n[[File:Maastricht, Randwyck, BrainsUnlimited2.jpg|thumb|Scannexus, part of Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus in Randwyck]]\n\n* Research and graduate schools of the School of Business and Economics:\n** Graduate School of Business and Economics (GSBE)\n** International Centre for Integrated assessment and Sustainable development (ICIS)\n** METEOR, Maastricht Research School of Economics of Technology and Organization, an umbrella for research schools affiliated with the UM School of Business and Economics:\n*** KAANS, monitoring school careers of youngsters in Limburg\n*** Limburg Institute of Financial Economics (LIFE)\n*** Maastricht Academic Centre for Research in Services (MAXX)\n*** Maastricht Accounting and Audit Research Centre (MARC)\n*** Network Social Innovation (NSI)\n*** Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (ROA)\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Law:\n** Maastricht Graduate School of Law (MGSL)\n** Ius Commune\n** School of Human Rights Research\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences:\n** Graduate School of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASOS), linked to WTMC, NIG, Huizinga Institute, OSL, Posthumus Institute, NICA, CERES, NOG, RMeS, and OPG\n* Graduate schools of the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences:\n** Maastricht University graduate School of susTainability science (MUST), linked to SENSE\n** Maastricht Graduate School of Governance (MGSoG)\n\n==== Independent research institutes ====\n* Maastricht Centre for Human Rights\n* Maastricht European Institute for Transnational Law Research (METRO), publishes the ''Maastricht Journal of European and Comparative Law''\n* Montesquieu Institute, Centre for European Parliamentary History and Constitutional Development (in [[The Hague]] and Maastricht)\n* [[UNU-MERIT]], Maastricht Economic and social Research and training centre on Innovation and Technology, part of [[United Nations University]]\n\n==== Knowledge transfer, entrepreneurship ====\nAs elsewhere, ongoing research at Maastricht University is translated into practice, leading to new products to be launched on the market. UM cooperates with businesses and socially relevant organisations through various programmes and institutes, like the Maastricht Centre for Entrepreneurship, Service Science Factory, BioMedbooster, BioPartner Center Maastricht, Contract Research Centre and SME Portal Maastricht University. UM Holding is the corporate venture firm of UM spin-off companies and participations.\n\nBrainport 2020 is the name of a programme that aims at campus development in four locations in the province of Limburg, in cooperation with the local government, business sector and knowledge institutions in the region:\n* Brightlands Maastricht Health Campus in Maastricht-Randwyck, specialising in health and wellbeing\n* Chemelot Campus in [[Sittard-Geleen]], focusing on chemistry and materials\n* Smart Services Hub in [[Heerlen]], focusing on finance, administration and informational services\n* Greenport Campus in [[Venlo]], focusing on food and horticulture, with links to logistics and manufacturing\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:2018 Maastricht, Zuid-Willemsvaart 13.jpg|thumb|Rowing with MSRV Saurus in [[Zuid-Willemsvaart]]]]\nIn 2013, nearly 16,000 students studied at Maastricht University, 47% of whom were foreign.  Students in Maastricht can affiliate with a number of student associations, international associations or debating societies. They present themselves during the annual INKOM, the general introduction week for new Maastricht students. Furthermore, Maastricht offers several cultural and sports activities in and around the city.\n\n[[File:GroteGracht42-54.jpg|thumb|left|Student housing, Grote Gracht]]\n\n===Student housing===\nLike most other Dutch universities, UM itself does not provide regular student housing. However, the university participates in a student housing foundation, offering mediation services to students. About 2,700 rooms and apartments offered through the Maastricht student housing foundation are provided by local housing associations Woonpunt, Servatius and Maasvallei. Some 8,000 other accommodations are provided by private landlords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kamerburo.net/content/about.asp?lang=uk&task=over|title=About the Kamerburo|publisher=Kamerburo Maastricht|accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref> Most units are located in houses or small apartment complexes across the historic city centre or in its immediate surrounding neighbourhoods. Many foreign exchange students live at the UM Guesthouse in Annadal, which provides short-term housing.\n\n===Student Service Centre===\nUM's Student Service Centre is located in the former Bonnefanten monastery and offers financial, legal and other forms of advise to students.

A perfusion student will typically begin his or her training in a [[Didactic method|didactic fashion]] in which the student will closely follow instructions from a certified clinical perfusionist in the confines of a cardiac surgery procedure. Academic coursework may be concurrent or precede this clinical instruction. Early in their clinical training, the perfusion student may have little involvement outside of an observational role. However, as time progresses, more tasks may be incrementally delegated to them. Upon graduating from a perfusion program, the graduate must begin the certification process. In the interim, the perfusion graduate is typically referred to as board-eligible, which is sufficient for employment in cardiac surgery with the understanding that achieving certified status is required for long-term employment. Most employers have stipulations on the duration of board-eligible status.\n\nTo become certified as a certified clinical perfusionist, a perfusionist must undergo a two-part exam administered by the [[American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion]].

[[British Columbia Institute of Technology]] in Burnaby offers an advanced specialty certificate in cardiovascular perfusion to graduates of its two-year program. Applicants must be certified respiratory therapists, critical care nurses, or cardiac professionals with two years or more of current experience in cardiac critical care. Applicants to the [[The Michener Institute|Michener Institute]] program in Toronto must have a [[bachelor's degree]]. The training program is 16 months to two years. The perfusion program of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] is a three-year [[bachelor's degree]] of 90 credits in biomedical science of which 27 credits are specific to clinical perfusion and in addition a dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes sup\u00e9rieurs sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es (DESS) of 30 credits in clinical perfusion of one-year at the master level.\n\n===United Kingdom and Ireland===\n{{confusing|reason=is the training course prior to or whilst a trainee perfusionist?Which parts are paid?|date=February 2017}}\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], a bachelor's degree in a science subject (usually life or clinical sciences) is a prerequisite to enrolment on the two-year perfusion training course. Employment as a trainee perfusionist is also required. Trainees must complete a two-year MSc program at the [[University of Bristol]]. They complete academic assessments (essays and exams), while in the workplace moving from a purely observational role to one in which they are capable of managing the patient while they are on cardiopulmonary system with minimal supervision. Once a trainee has been the primary perfusionist in 150 clinical procedures, they must undertake a practical exam. For this exam, the candidate is observed by two external examiners whilst building and priming a cardiopulmonary circuit, then using it during a surgical operation. After the practical exam, trainees must complete a 40-minute ''viva voce'' exam, which tests their academic knowledge. After this is successfully completed, they are awarded an MSc in Clinical Perfusion Science and the status of accredited clinical perfusion scientist. They must maintain this by performing a minimum of 40 clinical procedures per year.\n\n=== Australia and New Zealand ===\nIn [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], a perfusionist must have at least a science degree (usually in health sciences) as an entry requirement before training. Further didactic training is in a practical format at a hospital whilst doing a three-year course via correspondence and e-learning, with the Australian and New Zealand College of Perfusionists (ANZCP). The final examination for a clinical perfusionist is administered by the ANZCP over two days. This involves three hours of written assessment, two hours of multiple choice questions, and four half-hour ''[[Oral exam|viva voce]]''.\n\nA separate profession is the medical perfusionist who is a [[physician]] who has undertaken additional subspecialty training.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mdhs-study.unimelb.edu.au/short-courses/mms-short-courses/medical-perfusion/overview|title=Overview - Overview \u2014 MDHS Study|website=mdhs-study.unimelb.edu.au|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n===India===\n\nIn [[India]], there are different programs for educating perfusionists.

A perfusion student will typically begin his or her training in a [[Didactic method|didactic fashion]] in which the student will closely follow instructions from a certified clinical perfusionist in the confines of a cardiac surgery procedure. Academic coursework may be concurrent or precede this clinical instruction. Early in their clinical training, the perfusion student may have little involvement outside of an observational role. However, as time progresses, more tasks may be incrementally delegated to them. Upon graduating from a perfusion program, the graduate must begin the certification process. In the interim, the perfusion graduate is typically referred to as board-eligible, which is sufficient for employment in cardiac surgery with the understanding that achieving certified status is required for long-term employment. Most employers have stipulations on the duration of board-eligible status.\n\nTo become certified as a certified clinical perfusionist, a perfusionist must undergo a two-part exam administered by the [[American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion]].

Under an alternating magnetic field, the magnetic nanoparticles are heated, and this heat permeabilizes the membrane. This causes release of the loaded drug. This treatment option has a lot of potential as the combination of hyperthermia and drug release is likely to treat tumors better than either option alone, but it is still under development.\n\n=== Information storage ===\n{{see also|MRAM}}\nA promising candidate for high-density storage is the face-centered tetragonal phase FePt alloy.

In one application, the magnetic bead is attached to a poly T tail. When mixed with mRNA, the poly A tail of the mRNA will attach to the bead's poly T tail and the isolation takes place simply by placing a magnet on the side of the tube and pouring out the liquid. Magnetic beads have also been used in plasmid assembly. Rapid genetic circuit construction has been achieved by the sequential addition of genes onto a growing genetic chain, using nanobeads as an anchor. This method has been shown to be much faster than previous methods, taking less than an hour to create functional multi-gene constructs in vitro.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 14.

The reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts occurs at the surface atoms. Consequently, great effort is made to maximize the surface area of a catalyst by distributing it over the support. The support may be inert or participate in the catalytic reactions. Typical supports include various kinds of carbon, alumina, and silica. Immobilizing the catalytic center on top of nanoparticles with a large [[surface to volume ratio]] addresses this problem. In the case of magnetic nanoparticles it adds the property of facile a separation<!-- Needs clarification.... -->.

Under an alternating magnetic field, the magnetic nanoparticles are heated, and this heat permeabilizes the membrane. This causes release of the loaded drug. This treatment option has a lot of potential as the combination of hyperthermia and drug release is likely to treat tumors better than either option alone, but it is still under development.\n\n=== Information storage ===\n{{see also|MRAM}}\nA promising candidate for high-density storage is the face-centered tetragonal phase FePt alloy. Grain sizes can be as small as 3 nanometers. If it's possible to modify the MNPs at this small scale, the information density that can be achieved with this media could easily surpass 1 Terabyte per square inch.<ref name=\"nanoscienceworks.org\"/>.\n\n=== Genetic engineering ===\nMagnetic nanoparticles can be used for a variety of genetics applications. One application is the rapid isolation of DNA<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ernst|first=Constanze|last2=Bartel|first2=Alexander|last3=Elferink|first3=Johannes Wilhelmus|last4=Huhn|first4=Jennifer|last5=Eschbach|first5=Erik|last6=Sch\u00f6nfeld|first6=Kirsten|last7=Fe\u00dfler|first7=Andrea T.|last8=Oberheitmann|first8=Boris|last9=Schwarz|first9=Stefan|date=2019|title=Improved DNA extraction and purification with magnetic nanoparticles for the detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|journal=Veterinary Microbiology|language=en|volume=230|pages=45\u201348|doi=10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.01.009|pmid=30827403}}</ref> and mRNA. In one application, the magnetic bead is attached to a poly T tail. When mixed with mRNA, the poly A tail of the mRNA will attach to the bead's poly T tail and the isolation takes place simply by placing a magnet on the side of the tube and pouring out the liquid. Magnetic beads have also been used in plasmid assembly. Rapid genetic circuit construction has been achieved by the sequential addition of genes onto a growing genetic chain, using nanobeads as an anchor. This method has been shown to be much faster than previous methods, taking less than an hour to create functional multi-gene constructs in vitro.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 14.
