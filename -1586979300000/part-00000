The amount of water lost by a plant also depends on its size and the amount of water absorbed at the roots. Transpiration accounts for most of the water loss by a plant by the leaves and young stems.  Transpiration serves to evaporatively cool plants, as the evaporating water carries away heat energy due to its large [[Latent heat|latent heat of vaporization]] of 2260&nbsp;kJ per litre.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Feature !! Effect on transpiration\n|-\n| Number of leaves || More leaves (or spines, or other photosynthesizing organs) means a bigger surface area and more stomata for gaseous exchange. This will result in greater water loss.\n|-\n| Number of stomata || More stomata will provide more pores for transpiration.\n|-\n| Size of the leaf || A leaf with a bigger surface area will transpire faster than a leaf with a smaller surface area. \n|-\n| Presence of [[plant cuticle]] || A waxy cuticle is relatively impermeable to water and water vapour and reduces evaporation from the plant surface except via the stomata. A reflective cuticle will reduce solar heating and temperature rise of the leaf, helping to reduce the rate of evaporation. Tiny hair-like structures called [[trichome]]s on the surface of leaves also can inhibit water loss by creating a high humidity environment at the surface of leaves. These are some examples of the adaptations of plants for conservation of water that may be found on many [[xerophytes]]. \n|-\n| Light supply || The rate of transpiration is controlled by stomatal aperture, and these small pores open especially for photosynthesis. While there are exceptions to this (such as night or [[CAM photosynthesis]]), in general a light supply will encourage open stomata.\n|-\n| Temperature || Temperature affects the rate in two ways:\n1) An increased rate of evaporation due to a temperature rise will hasten the loss of water.\n<br/> 2) Decreased ''relative'' humidity outside the leaf will increase the water [[potential gradient]].\n|-\n| Relative humidity || Drier surroundings gives a steeper water potential gradient, and so increases the rate of transpiration.\n|-\n| Wind || In still air, water lost due to transpiration can accumulate in the form of vapor close to the leaf surface. This will reduce the rate of water loss, as the water potential gradient from inside to outside of the leaf is then slightly less. Wind blows away much of this water vapor near the leaf surface, making the potential gradient steeper and speeding up the diffusion of water molecules into the surrounding air. Even in wind, though, there may be some accumulation of water vapor in a thin [[boundary layer]] of slower moving air next to the leaf surface. The stronger the wind, the thinner this layer will tend to be, and the steeper the water potential gradient.\n|-\n| Water supply || [[Irrigation in viticulture|Water stress]] caused by restricted water supply from the soil may result in stomatal closure and reduce the rates of transpiration.\n|}\n<gallery widths=\"250px\">\nFile:Transpiration Temperature Graph.svg|The effect of temperature on the transpiration rate of plants.\nFile:Transpiration WindVelocity Graph.svg|The effect of wind velocity on the transpiration rate of plants.\nFile:Transpiration Humidity Graph.svg|The effect of humidity on the transpiration rate of plants.\n</gallery>\n[[Image:Xerophyte.png|thumb|Some [[xerophyte]]s will reduce the surface of their leaves during water deficiencies (left).

An acre of corn gives off about 3,000\u20134,000&nbsp;gallons (11,400\u201315,100 liters) of water each day, and a large oak tree can transpire 40,000&nbsp;gallons (151,000&nbsp;liters) per year. The transpiration ratio is the ratio of the mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced; the transpiration ratio of [[crops]] tends to fall between 200 and 1000 (''i.e.'', crop plants transpire 200 to 1000&nbsp;kg of water for every kg of dry [[matter]] produced).<ref>{{Citation |last=Martin |first=J. |last2=Leonard |first2=W. |last3=Stamp |first3=D. |title=Principles of Field Crop Production |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-02-376720-3}}</ref>\n\nTranspiration rates of plants can be measured by a number of techniques, including [[potometer]]s, [[lysimeter]]s, porometers, [[photosynthesis system]]s and thermometric sap flow sensors.

Many desert plants have a special type of photosynthesis, termed [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] or CAM photosynthesis, in which the stomata are closed during the day and open at night when transpiration will be lower.\n\n== Cavitation ==\nTo maintain the pressure gradient necessary for a plant to remain healthy they must continuously uptake water with their roots. They need to be able to meet the demands of water lost due to transpiration. If a plant is incapable of bringing in enough water to remain in equilibrium with transpiration an event known as [[cavitation]] occurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yong-Jiang|date=December 2016|title=Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential \"Circuit Breaker\" against Cavitation|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=172|issue=4|pages=2261\u20132274|pmid=27733514|pmc=5129713|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01191}}</ref> Cavitation is when the plant cannot supply its xylem with adequate water so instead of being filled with water the xylem begins to be filled with water vapor. These particles of water vapor come together and form blockages within the xylem of the plant.

This then allows for the roots to generate over 0.05 mPa of pressure, and that is capable of destroying the blockage and refilling the xylem with water, reconnecting the vascular system. If a plant is unable to generate enough pressure to eradicate the blockage it must prevent the blockage from spreading with the use of pit pears and then create new xylem that can re-connect the vascular system of the plant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Tiaz|first=Lincoln|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-1605352558|location=Massachusetts|pages=63}}</ref>\n\nScientists have begun using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) to monitor the internal status of the xylem during transpiration, in a non invasive manner. This method of imaging allows for scientists to visualize the movement of water throughout the entirety of the plant. It also is capable of viewing what phase the water is in while in the xylem, which makes it possible to visualize cavitation events. Scientists were able to see that over the course of 20 hours of sunlight more than 10 xylem vessels began filling with gas particles becoming cavitated. MRI technology also made it possible to view the process by which the plant was able to repair these xylem structures. After three hours in darkness it was seen that the plant was able to resupply its vascular tissue with liquid water. This was possible because in darkness the stomates of the plant are closed and transpiration no longer occurs. When transpiration is halted the plant can destroy the cavitation bubbles with the use of pressure generated by the roots. These observations suggest that MRIs are capable of monitoring the functional status of xylem and allows scientists to view cavitation events for the first time.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Antitranspirant]] \u2013 a substance to prevent transpiration\n* [[Canopy conductance]]\n* [[Ecohydrology]]\n* [[Eddy covariance]] flux (aka eddy correlation, eddy flux)\n* [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]\n* [[Latent heat flux]]\n* [[Perspiration]]\n* [[Soil plant atmosphere continuum]]\n* [[Stomatal conductance]]\n* [[Transpiration stream]]\n* [[Turgor pressure]]\n* [[Weap|Water Evaluation And Planning system (WEAP)]]\n{{NIE Poster}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleevapotranspiration.html USGS The Water Cycle: Evapotranspiration]\n\n{{Botany}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hydrology]]\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|plant transpiration|transpiration in human and animal physiology|Sweating|and|Hyperhydrosis}}\n\n[[File:transpiration Overview.svg|thumb|Overview of transpiration: {{ordered list |style=margin-top:0.5em\n    |Water is passively transported into the roots and then into the [[xylem]].\n    |The forces of cohesion and adhesion cause the water molecules to form a column in the xylem.\n    |Water moves from the xylem into the mesophyll cells, evaporates from their surfaces and leaves the plant by diffusion through the stomata\n    }}\n]]\n[[File:Transpiration of Water in Xylem.svg|thumb|Transpiration of Water in Xylem]]\n[[Image:Tomato leaf stomate 1-color.jpg|thumb|[[Stoma]] in a [[tomato]] leaf shown via colorized [[scanning electron microscope]]]]\n[[Image:Afternoon Clouds over the Amazon Rainforest.jpg|thumb|The [[clouds]] in this image of the [[Amazon Rainforest]] are a result of [[evapotranspiration]].]]\n\n'''Transpiration''' is the process of [[water]] movement through a [[plant]] and its [[evaporation]] from aerial parts, such as [[leaf|leaves]], [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[flower]]s.

Transpiration accounts for most of the water loss by a plant by the leaves and young stems.  Transpiration serves to evaporatively cool plants, as the evaporating water carries away heat energy due to its large [[Latent heat|latent heat of vaporization]] of 2260&nbsp;kJ per litre.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Feature !! Effect on transpiration\n|-\n| Number of leaves || More leaves (or spines, or other photosynthesizing organs) means a bigger surface area and more stomata for gaseous exchange. This will result in greater water loss.\n|-\n| Number of stomata || More stomata will provide more pores for transpiration.\n|-\n| Size of the leaf || A leaf with a bigger surface area will transpire faster than a leaf with a smaller surface area. \n|-\n| Presence of [[plant cuticle]] || A waxy cuticle is relatively impermeable to water and water vapour and reduces evaporation from the plant surface except via the stomata. A reflective cuticle will reduce solar heating and temperature rise of the leaf, helping to reduce the rate of evaporation. Tiny hair-like structures called [[trichome]]s on the surface of leaves also can inhibit water loss by creating a high humidity environment at the surface of leaves. These are some examples of the adaptations of plants for conservation of water that may be found on many [[xerophytes]]. \n|-\n| Light supply || The rate of transpiration is controlled by stomatal aperture, and these small pores open especially for photosynthesis. While there are exceptions to this (such as night or [[CAM photosynthesis]]), in general a light supply will encourage open stomata.\n|-\n| Temperature || Temperature affects the rate in two ways:\n1) An increased rate of evaporation due to a temperature rise will hasten the loss of water.\n<br/> 2) Decreased ''relative'' humidity outside the leaf will increase the water [[potential gradient]].\n|-\n| Relative humidity || Drier surroundings gives a steeper water potential gradient, and so increases the rate of transpiration.\n|-\n| Wind || In still air, water lost due to transpiration can accumulate in the form of vapor close to the leaf surface. This will reduce the rate of water loss, as the water potential gradient from inside to outside of the leaf is then slightly less. Wind blows away much of this water vapor near the leaf surface, making the potential gradient steeper and speeding up the diffusion of water molecules into the surrounding air. Even in wind, though, there may be some accumulation of water vapor in a thin [[boundary layer]] of slower moving air next to the leaf surface. The stronger the wind, the thinner this layer will tend to be, and the steeper the water potential gradient.\n|-\n| Water supply || [[Irrigation in viticulture|Water stress]] caused by restricted water supply from the soil may result in stomatal closure and reduce the rates of transpiration.\n|}\n<gallery widths=\"250px\">\nFile:Transpiration Temperature Graph.svg|The effect of temperature on the transpiration rate of plants.\nFile:Transpiration WindVelocity Graph.svg|The effect of wind velocity on the transpiration rate of plants.\nFile:Transpiration Humidity Graph.svg|The effect of humidity on the transpiration rate of plants.\n</gallery>\n[[Image:Xerophyte.png|thumb|Some [[xerophyte]]s will reduce the surface of their leaves during water deficiencies (left). If temperatures are cool enough and water levels are adequate the leaves expand again (right).]]\nDuring a growing season, a leaf will transpire many times more water than its own weight. An acre of corn gives off about 3,000\u20134,000&nbsp;gallons (11,400\u201315,100 liters) of water each day, and a large oak tree can transpire 40,000&nbsp;gallons (151,000&nbsp;liters) per year. The transpiration ratio is the ratio of the mass of water transpired to the mass of dry matter produced; the transpiration ratio of [[crops]] tends to fall between 200 and 1000 (''i.e.'', crop plants transpire 200 to 1000&nbsp;kg of water for every kg of dry [[matter]] produced).<ref>{{Citation |last=Martin |first=J. |last2=Leonard |first2=W. |last3=Stamp |first3=D. |title=Principles of Field Crop Production |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-02-376720-3}}</ref>\n\nTranspiration rates of plants can be measured by a number of techniques, including [[potometer]]s, [[lysimeter]]s, porometers, [[photosynthesis system]]s and thermometric sap flow sensors.

Many [[cactus|cacti]] conduct [[photosynthesis]] in [[succulent]] stems, rather than leaves, so the surface area of the shoot is very low. Many desert plants have a special type of photosynthesis, termed [[crassulacean acid metabolism]] or CAM photosynthesis, in which the stomata are closed during the day and open at night when transpiration will be lower.\n\n== Cavitation ==\nTo maintain the pressure gradient necessary for a plant to remain healthy they must continuously uptake water with their roots. They need to be able to meet the demands of water lost due to transpiration. If a plant is incapable of bringing in enough water to remain in equilibrium with transpiration an event known as [[cavitation]] occurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yong-Jiang|date=December 2016|title=Reversible Leaf Xylem Collapse: A Potential \"Circuit Breaker\" against Cavitation|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=172|issue=4|pages=2261\u20132274|pmid=27733514|pmc=5129713|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01191}}</ref> Cavitation is when the plant cannot supply its xylem with adequate water so instead of being filled with water the xylem begins to be filled with water vapor. These particles of water vapor come together and form blockages within the xylem of the plant. This prevents the plant from being able to transport water throughout its vascular system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hochberg|first=Uri|date=June 2017|title=Stomatal Closure, Basal Leaf Embolism, and Shedding Protect the Hydraulic Integrity of Grape Stems|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=174|issue=2|pages=764\u2013775|pmid=28351909|pmc=5462014|doi=10.1104/pp.16.01816}}</ref> There is no apparent pattern of where cavitation occurs throughout the plant's xylem.

This then allows for the roots to generate over 0.05 mPa of pressure, and that is capable of destroying the blockage and refilling the xylem with water, reconnecting the vascular system. If a plant is unable to generate enough pressure to eradicate the blockage it must prevent the blockage from spreading with the use of pit pears and then create new xylem that can re-connect the vascular system of the plant.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Plant Physiology and Development|last=Tiaz|first=Lincoln|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|year=2015|isbn=978-1605352558|location=Massachusetts|pages=63}}</ref>\n\nScientists have begun using [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) to monitor the internal status of the xylem during transpiration, in a non invasive manner. This method of imaging allows for scientists to visualize the movement of water throughout the entirety of the plant. It also is capable of viewing what phase the water is in while in the xylem, which makes it possible to visualize cavitation events. Scientists were able to see that over the course of 20 hours of sunlight more than 10 xylem vessels began filling with gas particles becoming cavitated. MRI technology also made it possible to view the process by which the plant was able to repair these xylem structures. After three hours in darkness it was seen that the plant was able to resupply its vascular tissue with liquid water. This was possible because in darkness the stomates of the plant are closed and transpiration no longer occurs. When transpiration is halted the plant can destroy the cavitation bubbles with the use of pressure generated by the roots. These observations suggest that MRIs are capable of monitoring the functional status of xylem and allows scientists to view cavitation events for the first time.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|small=yes}}\n* [[Antitranspirant]] \u2013 a substance to prevent transpiration\n* [[Canopy conductance]]\n* [[Ecohydrology]]\n* [[Eddy covariance]] flux (aka eddy correlation, eddy flux)\n* [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]\n* [[Latent heat flux]]\n* [[Perspiration]]\n* [[Soil plant atmosphere continuum]]\n* [[Stomatal conductance]]\n* [[Transpiration stream]]\n* [[Turgor pressure]]\n* [[Weap|Water Evaluation And Planning system (WEAP)]]\n{{NIE Poster}}\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleevapotranspiration.html USGS The Water Cycle: Evapotranspiration]\n\n{{Botany}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Hydrology]]\n[[Category:Plant physiology]]\n", "name_user": "2605:6000:170e:e23c:8098:ed25:ca3c:8c6b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpiration"}

For example, our ] are widely used, whereas 40- or 48-card [[Italian-suited packs]] are common in Italy and 40- and 48-card [[Spanish-suited packs]] on the Iberian peninsula. In addition, [[tarot card games|tarot cards]] are required for games such as [[French tarot]] (78 cards), which is widely played in France, and the [[Tarock]] family of games (42 or  54 cards) played in countries like Austria and Hungary.\n\n==English pattern cards and nicknames==\n{{For|a comprehensive list of card nicknames|List of playing card nicknames}}\n\nThe fanciful design and manufacturer's logo commonly displayed on the [[ace of spades]] began under the reign of [[James I of England]], who passed a law requiring an insignia on that card as proof of payment of a [[tax]] on local manufacture of cards. Until August 4, 1960, decks of playing cards printed and sold in the [[United Kingdom]] were liable for taxable duty and the ace of spades carried an indication of the name of the printer and the fact that taxation had been paid on the cards.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Stamp Act 1765]] imposed a tax on playing cards.</ref> The packs were also sealed with a government [[duty]] wrapper.\n\nThough specific design elements of the court cards are rarely used in gameplay and many differ between designs, a few are notable. \n*'''Face cards''' or '''court cards'''{{snd}}jacks, queens, and kings are called \"face cards\" in North America because the cards have pictures of their names. In Britain they are called \"court cards\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*'''One-eyed Royals'''{{snd}}the jack of spades and jack of hearts (often called the '''\" one-eyed jacks\"''') and the king of diamonds are drawn in profile; therefore, these cards are commonly referred to as \"one-eyed\". The rest of the courts are shown in full or oblique face.\n*The jack of diamonds is sometimes known as '''\" laughing boy\"'''. \n*'''Wild cards'''{{snd}}When deciding which cards are to be made wild in some games, the phrase \"acey, deucey or [[one-eyed jack]]\" (or \"deuces, aces, one-eyed faces\") is sometimes used, which means that [[ace]]s, twos, and the one-eyed jacks are all wild. \n*The king of hearts is the only king with no moustache; \n*'''Suicide kings'''{{snd}}The king of hearts is typically shown with a [[sword]] behind his head, making him appear to be stabbing himself. Similarly, the one-eyed king of diamonds is typically shown with an axe behind his head with the blade facing toward him. These depictions, and their blood-red colour, inspired the nickname '''\" suicide kings\"'''. \n*The king of diamonds is traditionally armed with an axe while the other three kings are armed with swords; thus, the king of diamonds is sometimes referred to as \"'''the man with the axe'''\". This is the basis of the trump \"[[one-eyed jack]]s and the man with the axe\". Poker may be played with wild cards, often \"Aces, Jacks, and the King with the Axe\". \n*The [[ace of spades]], unique in its large, ornate spade, is sometimes said to be the death card or the picture card, and in some games is used as a trump card. \n*The [[queen of spades]] usually holds a [[sceptre]] and is sometimes known as \"the bedpost queen\", though more often she is called \"black lady\". She also is the only queen facing left.\n*In many decks, the queen of clubs holds a flower. She is thus known as the '''\"flower queen\"''', though this design element is among the most variable; the Bicycle Poker deck depicts all queens with a flower styled according to their suit.\n*\"2\" cards are also known as '''deuces'''.\n*\"3\" cards are also known as '''treys'''.\n\n==Size of the cards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\"\n! rowspan=2|Category ||colspan=\"2\" | Length||colspan=\"2\" | Width\n|-\n! in||mm||in||mm<ref>The poker size is associated with the B8 size according to [[ISO 216]]</ref>\n|-\n| Bridge size || {{convert|3+1/2|in|disp=table}} || {{convert|2+1/4|in|disp=table}}\n|- \n| Poker size || {{convert|3+1/2|in|disp=table}} || {{convert|2+1/2|in|disp=table}}\n|}\nModern playing cards are available in both \"wide\" and \"narrow\" sizes, often now commonly referred to as either 'poker' or 'bridge' sized;<ref>Kem Cards official website. {{Citation|title=Narrow (Bridge) Size verses Wide (Poker) Size|url=http://www.kemcards.net/kem-narrow-vs-wide-size|accessdate=2014-02-27|postscript=.}}</ref> nominal dimensions are summarized in the adjacent table.  Notwithstanding these generally accepted dimensions, there is no formal requirement for precise adherence and minor variations are produced by various manufacturers.<ref>In a sample of 95 bridge and poker card sets, lengths ranged from 87.50&nbsp;mm to 89.50&nbsp;mm. In a sample of 28 bridge sized cards, widths varied from 56.98&nbsp;mm to 58.25&nbsp;mm. In a sample of 67 poker sized cards, widths varied from 62.44 to 63.54&nbsp;mm.

In most US casino poker games, plastic bridge (narrow) sized cards are used; this is for both ease of use and dealing, and the plastic cards last much longer than paper decks. Casino [[shuffling machine]]s have traditionally been designed for bridge-size (narrow) cards for these reasons. In other table games, such as 21 ([[blackjack]]), a modern casino may use hundreds or even thousands of decks per day, so paper cards are used for those, for economic reasons. Poker-size (wide) paper decks are used for 21 and other similar games.  Other sizes are also available, such as a smaller '[[Patience (game)|patience]]' size (usually {{convert|1+3/4|xx|2+3/8|in|mm|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and larger 'jumbo' ones for [[Card manipulation|card tricks]]. \n\nThe thickness and weight of modern playing cards are subject to numerous variables related to their purpose of use and associated material design for durability, stiffness, texture and appearance.<ref>In a sample of 28 bridge sized cards, the weight of a card varied from 1.8&nbsp;g to 2.48&nbsp;g and thickness from 0.26&nbsp; mm to 0.34&nbsp; mm.

[[Casino]] [[blackjack]] decks may include markings intended for a machine to check the ranks of cards, or shifts in rank location to allow a manual check via an inlaid mirror. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of just two. Many modern decks have bar code markings on the edge of the face to enable them to be sorted by machine (for playing duplicate bridge, especially simultaneous events where the same hands may be played at many different venues). Many decks have large indices, largely for use in [[stud poker]] games, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small. Some decks use [[four-color deck|four colors]] for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart: the most common set of colors is black (spades \u2660), red (hearts <span style=\"color:red;\">\u2665</span>), blue (diamonds <span style=\"color:blue;\">\u2666</span>) and green (clubs <span style=\"color:green;\">\u2663</span>). Another common color set is borrowed from the German suits and uses green spades and yellow diamonds with red hearts and black clubs.\n\nWhen giving the full written name of a specific card, the rank is given first followed by the suit, e.g., \"ace of spades\". Shorthand notation may reflect this by listing the rank first, \"A\u2660\"; this is common usage when discussing [[poker]].  Alternatively, listing the suit first, as in \"\u2660K\" for a single card or \"\u2660AKQ\" for multiple cards, is common practise when writing about [[Contract bridge|bridge]]; this helps differentiate between the card(s) and the contract (e.g. \"4<span style=\"color:red;\">\u2665</span>\", a contract of four hearts).

In addition, [[tarot card games|tarot cards]] are required for games such as [[French Tarot]] (78 cards), which is widely played in France, and the [[Tarock]] family of games (42 or  54 cards) played in countries like Austria and Hungary.\n\n==English pattern cards and nicknames==\n{{For|a comprehensive list of card nicknames|List of playing card nicknames}}\n\nThe fanciful design and manufacturer's logo commonly displayed on the [[ace of spades]] began under the reign of [[James I of England]], who passed a law requiring an insignia on that card as proof of payment of a [[tax]] on local manufacture of cards. Until August 4, 1960, decks of playing cards printed and sold in the [[United Kingdom]] were liable for taxable duty and the ace of spades carried an indication of the name of the printer and the fact that taxation had been paid on the cards.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Stamp Act 1765]] imposed a tax on playing cards.</ref> The packs were also sealed with a government [[duty]] wrapper.\n\nThough specific design elements of the court cards are rarely used in gameplay and many differ between designs, a few are notable. \n*'''Face cards''' or '''court cards'''{{snd}}jacks, queens, and kings are called \"face cards\" in North America because the cards have pictures of their names. In Britain they are called \"court cards\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n*'''One-eyed Royals'''{{snd}}the jack of spades and jack of hearts (often called the '''\" one-eyed jacks\"''') and the king of diamonds are drawn in profile; therefore, these cards are commonly referred to as \"one-eyed\". The rest of the courts are shown in full or oblique face.\n*The jack of diamonds is sometimes known as '''\" laughing boy\"'''. \n*'''Wild cards'''{{snd}}When deciding which cards are to be made wild in some games, the phrase \"acey, deucey or [[one-eyed jack]]\" (or \"deuces, aces, one-eyed faces\") is sometimes used, which means that [[ace]]s, twos, and the one-eyed jacks are all wild. \n*The king of hearts is the only king with no moustache; \n*'''Suicide kings'''{{snd}}The king of hearts is typically shown with a [[sword]] behind his head, making him appear to be stabbing himself. Similarly, the one-eyed king of diamonds is typically shown with an axe behind his head with the blade facing toward him. These depictions, and their blood-red colour, inspired the nickname '''\" suicide kings\"'''. \n*The king of diamonds is traditionally armed with an axe while the other three kings are armed with swords; thus, the king of diamonds is sometimes referred to as \"'''the man with the axe'''\". This is the basis of the trump \"[[one-eyed jack]]s and the man with the axe\". Poker may be played with wild cards, often \"Aces, Jacks, and the King with the Axe\". \n*The [[ace of spades]], unique in its large, ornate spade, is sometimes said to be the death card or the picture card, and in some games is used as a trump card. \n*The [[queen of spades]] usually holds a [[sceptre]] and is sometimes known as \"the bedpost queen\", though more often she is called \"black lady\". She also is the only queen facing left.\n*In many decks, the queen of clubs holds a flower. She is thus known as the '''\"flower queen\"''', though this design element is among the most variable; the Bicycle Poker deck depicts all queens with a flower styled according to their suit.\n*\"2\" cards are also known as '''deuces'''.\n*\"3\" cards are also known as '''treys'''.\n\n==Size of the cards==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:10px;\"\n! rowspan=2|Category ||colspan=\"2\" | Length||colspan=\"2\" | Width\n|-\n! in||mm||in||mm<ref>The poker size is associated with the B8 size according to [[ISO 216]]</ref>\n|-\n| Bridge size || {{convert|3+1/2|in|disp=table}} || {{convert|2+1/4|in|disp=table}}\n|- \n| Poker size || {{convert|3+1/2|in|disp=table}} || {{convert|2+1/2|in|disp=table}}\n|}\nModern playing cards are available in both \"wide\" and \"narrow\" sizes, often now commonly referred to as either 'poker' or 'bridge' sized;<ref>Kem Cards official website. {{Citation|title=Narrow (Bridge) Size verses Wide (Poker) Size|url=http://www.kemcards.net/kem-narrow-vs-wide-size|accessdate=2014-02-27|postscript=.}}</ref> nominal dimensions are summarized in the adjacent table.  Notwithstanding these generally accepted dimensions, there is no formal requirement for precise adherence and minor variations are produced by various manufacturers.<ref>In a sample of 95 bridge and poker card sets, lengths ranged from 87.50&nbsp;mm to 89.50&nbsp;mm. In a sample of 28 bridge sized cards, widths varied from 56.98&nbsp;mm to 58.25&nbsp;mm. In a sample of 67 poker sized cards, widths varied from 62.44 to 63.54&nbsp;mm. Reference: Home Poker Tourney website. {{Citation|title= Playing Card Review|url=http://www.homepokertourney.com/playing-card-reviews.htm|accessdate=2014-02-27|postscript=.}}</ref>\n\nThe slightly narrower cards are more suitable for games such as [[Contract bridge|bridge]] and some types of poker, where a number of cards must be held or concealed in a player's hand. In most US casino poker games, plastic bridge (narrow) sized cards are used; this is for both ease of use and dealing, and the plastic cards last much longer than paper decks. Casino [[shuffling machine]]s have traditionally been designed for bridge-size (narrow) cards for these reasons. In other table games, such as 21 ([[blackjack]]), a modern casino may use hundreds or even thousands of decks per day, so paper cards are used for those, for economic reasons. Poker-size (wide) paper decks are used for 21 and other similar games.  Other sizes are also available, such as a smaller '[[Patience (game)|patience]]' size (usually {{convert|1+3/4|xx|2+3/8|in|mm|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and larger 'jumbo' ones for [[Card manipulation|card tricks]]. \n\nThe thickness and weight of modern playing cards are subject to numerous variables related to their purpose of use and associated material design for durability, stiffness, texture and appearance.<ref>In a sample of 28 bridge sized cards, the weight of a card varied from 1.8&nbsp;g to 2.48&nbsp;g and thickness from 0.26&nbsp; mm to 0.34&nbsp; mm. In a sample of 67 poker-sized cards, the weight of a card varied from 1.4&nbsp;g to 2.78&nbsp;g and thickness from 0.24&nbsp;mm to 0.34&nbsp;mm. Reference: Home Poker Tourney website. {{Citation|title= Playing Card Review|url=http://www.homepokertourney.com/playing-card-reviews.htm|accessdate=2014-02-27|postscript=.}}</ref>\n\n==Rank and color==\nSome decks include additional design elements. [[Casino]] [[blackjack]] decks may include markings intended for a machine to check the ranks of cards, or shifts in rank location to allow a manual check via an inlaid mirror. Many casino decks and solitaire decks have four indices instead of just two. Many modern decks have bar code markings on the edge of the face to enable them to be sorted by machine (for playing duplicate bridge, especially simultaneous events where the same hands may be played at many different venues). Many decks have large indices, largely for use in [[stud poker]] games, where being able to read cards from a distance is a benefit and hand sizes are small. Some decks use [[four-color deck|four colors]] for the suits in order to make it easier to tell them apart: the most common set of colors is black (spades \u2660), red (hearts <span style=\"color:red;\">\u2665</span>), blue (diamonds <span style=\"color:blue;\">\u2666</span>) and green (clubs <span style=\"color:green;\">\u2663</span>). Another common color set is borrowed from the German suits and uses green spades and yellow diamonds with red hearts and black clubs.\n\nWhen giving the full written name of a specific card, the rank is given first followed by the suit, e.g., \"ace of spades\". Shorthand notation may reflect this by listing the rank first, \"A\u2660\"; this is common usage when discussing [[poker]].  Alternatively, listing the suit first, as in \"\u2660K\" for a single card or \"\u2660AKQ\" for multiple cards, is common practise when writing about [[Contract bridge|bridge]]; this helps differentiate between the card(s) and the contract (e.g. \"4<span style=\"color:red;\">\u2665</span>\", a contract of four hearts). Tens may be either abbreviated to T or written as 10.\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example set of 52 playing cards; 13 of each suit clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades\n|-\n!\n\n![[Ace]]\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n!10\n![[Jack (playing card)|Jack]]\n![[Queen (playing card)|Queen]]\n![[King (playing card)|King]]\n|-\n!Clubs\n|{{card|club|A|40px}}\n|{{card|club|2|40px}}\n|{{card|club|3|40px}}\n|{{card|club|4|40px}}\n|{{card|club|5|40px}}\n|{{card|club|6|40px}}\n|{{card|club|7|40px}}\n|{{card|club|8|40px}}\n|{{card|club|9|40px}}\n|{{card|club|10|40px}}\n|{{card|club|J|40px}}\n|{{card|club|Q|40px}}\n|{{card|club|K|40px}}\n|-\n!Diamonds\n|{{card|diamond|A|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|2|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|3|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|4|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|5|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|6|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|7|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|8|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|9|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|10|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|J|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|Q|40px}}\n|{{card|diamond|K|40px}}\n|-\n!Hearts\n|{{card|heart|A|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|2|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|3|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|4|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|5|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|6|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|7|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|8|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|9|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|10|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|J|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|Q|40px}}\n|{{card|heart|K|40px}}\n|-\n!Spades\n|{{card|spade|A|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|2|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|3|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|4|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|5|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|6|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|7|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|8|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|9|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|10|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|J|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|Q|40px}}\n|{{card|spade|K|40px}}\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Unicode==\nAs of [[Unicode 7.0]] playing cards are now represented.

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].\n\nTorres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.\n\nOn 10th of May 1942 [[Benito Mussolini]] has visited the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fondoluce.archivioluce.com/LuceUnesco/avanzata/scheda/foto/IL3000006141/12/Mussolini-a-Porto-Torres.html?luoghi=Porto%20Torres|title=Mussolini a Porto Torres - Cinecitt\u00e0 Luce - Unesco|website=fondoluce.archivioluce.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Palm Sunday|18th of April 1943]] the city was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ricerca.gelocal.it/lanuovasardegna/archivio/lanuovasardegna/2010/04/18/SP1PO_SP107.html|title=Il bombardamento di 67 anni fa - La Nuova Sardegna|website=Archivio - La Nuova Sardegna|language=it|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Main sights==\n=== Archaeological sites ===\n\n* ''[[Necropolis]] of Su Crucifissu Mannu''\n* ''[[Domus de Janas]] of Campu Perdu ([[Asinara]])''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Biunisi''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Monte Elva''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Margone''\n* ''[[Nuraghe]] Nieddu''\n* \"''Turris Libisonis''\" Archaeological park\n\n* ''[[Roman bridge]] of Rio Mannu''\n\n* ''Palace of the \"Re Barbaro\" and [[domus]] of [[Orpheus]]''\n\n* ''Baths of Maetzke''\n\n* ''Baths of Pallottino''\n\n* ''Domus dei Mosaici''\n* ''Tanca Borgona''\n* ''The [[Arcosolium]]''\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\n==== Churches ====\n\n*The 11th-century  [[Basilica of San Gavino]], built using only hardstones like marble, porphyry and granite, is the largest [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] church in Sardinia.

This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].\n\nThe morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.\n\nThe communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]\nIn ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. \u00a7 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>\n\nThe ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.\n\n[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]].

The group have also recorded traditional ballad-style songs with piano accompaniment.\n\nA common motif in many of the group's songs is the use of the onomatopoeic [[gitaigo]] phrase \"pyon pyon\", to suggest the hopping sound that rabbits make. Their songs are also notable for including humorous dialogue between Bucho and the female members, usually with Bucho giving orders to the girls in the style of a military commander or the girls answering back at Bucho or making fun of him. In {{Nihongo|'''7 Principles of the DEATHRABBITS Army'''|\u30c7\u30b9\u30e9\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4\u8ecd\u306e\u4e03\u30b1\u6761}} Yuzu remarks mid-song that \"we can never understand anything Bucho says, so anyway...\", and in {{Nihongo|'''The Season for Falling in Love'''|\u604b\u3059\u308b\u5b63\u7bc0}} the girls decide part-way through the song that the lyrics are too depressing and they're going to change them to make the song happier and more positive.\n\nAn overriding theme of the group's first two albums, which might technically be considered [[concept albums]], describes a future alien invasion of earth. In {{Nihongo|'''Feelings of the Rabbit'''|\u3046\u3055\u304e\u306e\u304d\u3082\u3061}} this theme is discussed in detail and the accompanying music video includes scenes where a [[UFO]] arrives on earth and starts attacking cities while the group look on in disbelief. The success (or otherwise) of this invasion is dependent on whether humans can put aside their differences to work together to fend off the alien threat. The \"alien threat\" concept can also be read as a wry commentary on the notoriously competitive J-pop idol scene,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |website=The Guardian |title=Japan's bizarre music industry: J-Pop's dream factory |date=2005-08-21 |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> humorously referred to in earlier interviews with Bucho as the {{Nihongo|\"idol warring states era\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tablo.jp/culture/idol/news003496.html |website=TABLO |title=2018\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u671f\u306b\u89e3\u6563\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u7dcf\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3000\u300e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u300f\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b |date=2018-07-02 |access-date=2019-03-02 |language=Japanese}}</ref> In order for the group to survive and realise their dream of success, they must compete against the vast promotional budgets of the major talent agencies and record labels.

The group have also recorded traditional ballad-style songs with piano accompaniment.\n\nA common motif in many of the group's songs is the use of the onomatopoeic [[gitaigo]] phrase \"pyon pyon\", to suggest the hopping sound that rabbits make. Their songs are also notable for including humorous dialogue between Bucho and the female members, usually with Bucho giving orders to the girls in the style of a military commander or the girls answering back at Bucho or making fun of him.

In {{Nihongo|'''Feelings of the Rabbit'''|\u3046\u3055\u304e\u306e\u304d\u3082\u3061}} this theme is discussed in detail and the accompanying music video includes scenes where a [[UFO]] arrives on earth and starts attacking cities while the group look on in disbelief. The success (or otherwise) of this invasion is dependent on whether humans can put aside their differences to work together to fend off the alien threat. The \"alien threat\" concept can also be read as a wry commentary on the notoriously competitive J-pop idol scene,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |website=The Guardian |title=Japan's bizarre music industry: J-Pop's dream factory |date=2005-08-21 |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> humorously referred to in earlier interviews with Bucho as the {{Nihongo|\"idol warring states era\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tablo.jp/culture/idol/news003496.html |website=TABLO |title=2018\u5e74\u4e0a\u534a\u671f\u306b\u89e3\u6563\u3057\u305f\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u7dcf\u307e\u3068\u3081\u3000\u300e\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u6226\u56fd\u6642\u4ee3\u300f\u306f\u672c\u5f53\u306b\u7d42\u308f\u3063\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f\u306e\u304b |date=2018-07-02 |access-date=2019-03-02 |language=Japanese}}</ref> In order for the group to survive and realise their dream of success, they must compete against the vast promotional budgets of the major talent agencies and record labels.
