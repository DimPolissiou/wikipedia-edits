I-95 from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] is part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], during which it passes through the major cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].  After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the East Lyme\u2013Waterford town line]]\nI-95 follows [[Connecticut Turnpike]] from the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line eastward for {{convert|88|mi|km}}. This portion of the highway passes through the most heavily urbanized section of Connecticut along the shoreline between [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], with daily traffic volumes of around 150,000&nbsp;vehicles throughout the entire {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on}} length between the New York state line and the junction with I-91 in New Haven.<ref>{{cite web |last1 = Dixon |first1 = Ken |date=February 2, 2017 |title = Commission Approves Study for I-95 Widening in SW CT |url = https://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Commission-approves-study-for-I-95-widening-in-SW-10900695.php |website = [[Connecticut Post]] |location = Bridgeport |access-date = December 31, 2018 }}</ref> The turnpike intersects with several major expressways, namely [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]] at exit 15 in Norwalk, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]] and [[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] at exit 27A in Bridgeport (quickest way to I-84 from southwest CT), the [[Merritt Parkway|Merritt]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]]s at exit 38 (via the [[Milford Parkway (Connecticut)|Milford Parkway]]) in [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], and [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] at exit 48 in New Haven.\n\n===Fairfield County===\nI-95 enters Connecticut at its crossing of the [[Byram River]] into the town of Greenwich in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], where it continues southwest into New York as the [[Interstate 95 in New York|New England Thruway]]. Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the Connecticut Turnpike, a name that remains despite the fact that tolls were removed from the road in 1988. The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, coming to an interchange with Delevan Avenue about a half mile from the state line. The freeway continues through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County, reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and coming to an interchange with Arch Street to the south of downtown Greenwich. The road heads in the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] where it has an interchange with Indian Field Road, before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].\n\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and immediately interchanges with Harvard Avenue/West Avenue on the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]]. The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated. In this area, ramps from I-95 exist at a northbound exit to Greenwich Avenue, a southbound entrance from Washington Boulevard, a northbound exit and entrance and southbound exit to Canal Street, and a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Elm Street, the former three of which provide access to [[Connecticut Route 137|Route&nbsp;137]]. At this point, the freeway immediately crosses over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]], adjacent to the southbound entrance ramp.\n\nAfter this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction, prior to the interchange with Noroton Avenue in the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the southbound entrance has an outlet to the [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, the southbound direction narrows to three lanes again, and I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]], in which the latter junction is a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Next, the freeway turns to the northeast passing over the New Haven Line and coming to a service plaza and welcome center in the northbound direction, before reaching another interchange with US 1, that lacks a northbound entrance. \n\nImmediately after, the road comes into the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] in the neighborhood of [[South Norwalk]]. In the area, I-95 has ramps at a southbound exit and entrance and a northbound entrance to US 1/Scribner Avenue and a northbound exit to Fairfield Avenue, the latter of which provides access to the [[Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk]]. The freeway turns east-northeast as it comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]], where there is also a southbound exit ramp to West Avenue, crossing the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line within the interchange, before crossing the [[Norwalk River]], on the [[Yankee Doodle Bridge]]. Past the crossing, the road immediately meets the interchange with East Avenue in [[East Norwalk]].\n\nI-95 enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], just prior to reaching an interchange with the southern terminus [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]] and Route 136. Past this interchange, the freeway proceeds to cross over the [[Saugatuck River]] and continues to an interchange with the Sherwood Island Connector, which provides access to US 1 and [[Sherwood Island State Park]]. The road curves through wooded residential areas, where it comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]. Here, I-95 reaches an interchange with US 1/Center Street which serve the neighborhood of [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]]. Shortly after, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Bronson Road just before the crossing of the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]]. Passing to the north of [[Fairfield Center]], the freeway comes to an interchange with Mill Plain Road, before reaching a service plaza in both directions, where there also exists northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps to Round Hill Road. The other half component of this interchange is with [[Connecticut Route 135|Route 135]], and both provide access to the main campus of [[Fairfield University]]. From this point, the road curves through an interchange with US 1, before reaching another interchange with the Black Rock Turnpike on the eastern edge of town.\n\nFollowing the Black Rock Turnpike, I-95 enters the city of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], which is both the largest city in Fairfield County, and the state of Connecticut. On the city's West Side, the freeway has an interchange with State Street Extension and [[Connecticut Route 130|Route 130]], where it becomes elevated and gains a fourth southbound lane, as it passes through the industrial areas of the city's southwestern neighborhoods. Within that interchange, the road also crosses the New Haven Line. Further within the area, I-95 comes to an interchange with Wordin Avenue, before it crosses over the New Haven Line again and passes to south of downtown Bridgeport. Here, the freeway has a small interchange complex with both Lafayette Boulevard which provides access to many of the city's major landmarks in the South End and downtown area, and with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]]/[[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] which head north from I-95 as a four-lane freeway. From this point, the road narrows to three lanes in the southbound direction, and comes onto to the [[P.T. Barnum Bridge]] which carries it over the New Haven Line, adjacent to the [[Bridgeport station]], and the [[Pequonnock River]]. On the bridge, the northbound direction gains a fourth lane, as it comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance to [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] on Bridgeport's east side, after it passes over Route 130. I-95 reduces back to three lanes in the northbound direction, as it curves into the city's East End, where there is an interchange for Route 130 and Seaview Avenue.\n\nA short distance later, the freeway reaches a northbound exit and southbound entrance to [[Connecticut Route 113|Route 113]], within which, the highway enters the town of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]]. Route 113 provides access to the [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]], while the other half component of the interchange is with Surf Avenue. Afterward, the road turns to the northeast coming to an interchange with Honeyspot Road/South Avenue. A short distance later, I-95 reaches an interchange with Broad Street, within downtown Stratford that also provides access to Route 113. The freeway heads into a commercial area, where it has a northbound exit and southbound entrance serving US 1 and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]], before crossing the [[Housatonic River]] on the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]], where the route leaves Fairfield County.\n\n===New Haven County===\n\nOn the Moses Wheeler Bridge, I-95 crosses into [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], where it heads into residential areas on the other side of the river. Here, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 1, within the village of [[Devon (Milford)|Devon]], before it crosses the New Haven Line and reaches another interchange with Schoolhouse Road/Sub Way, in which the latter road is named for the world headquarters of the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant chain. The road continues northeast through wooded areas of the western part of Milford, where it has a full interchange with Plains Road, and a northbound exit and southbound entrance with High Street, before reaching the interchange with the [[Milford Parkway]] to the northeast of Downtown Milford. The Milford Parkway, a four-lane limited access parkway, provides access from I-95, as well as US 1 to [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which are both components of [[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]. Access exists only to and from the direction of Route 15, and commercial vehicles are prohibited. The freeway enters a reverse turn, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 adjacent to the [[Connecticut Post Mall]], located at the northeastern corner of the interchange. The road heads northeast again into commercial surroundings, coming to an interchange with Old Gate Lane/Woodmont Road. From here, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, before coming into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it reaches an interchange with Marsh Hill Road. The overpass carrying Marsh Hill Road is called the [[Salemme Memorial Bridge]], and the exit provides access to the West Campus of [[Yale University]].\n\nThe road passes to the northwest of the university campus as it enters the city of [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]]. Here, I-95 passes mixed areas of suburban development, where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 162|Route 162]]. Thru trucks to Downtown West Haven must use this exit, as trucks may not use the northbound exit ramp at the next interchange, for Campbell Avenue and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 122|Route 122]], due to its steep incline. The road makes another reverse turn, where it crosses the New Haven Line and the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]], and comes into the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Immediately after crossing the river, I-95 comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], which provides access to the [[Yale Bowl]] and connects to [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]]. From this point, the freeway heads northeast, passing a right-in/right-out interchange with Long Wharf Drive in the northbound direction, and Sargent Drive in the southbound direction along [[New Haven Harbor]], in the neighborhood of [[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]], before reaching the large interchange complex southeast of [[Downtown New Haven]]. The complex includes an interchange with a flyover ramp to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard serving the downtown area, as well as the highway's split with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], which heads north-northeast from I-95 towards the [[Connecticut State Capitol]] at [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Past I-91, the freeway turns southeast to cross the [[Quinnipiac River]] on the [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as simply the \"Q Bridge\". On the other side of the bridge, the road heads into another area of mixed development in [[The Annex (New Haven)|The Annex]] neighborhood. Here, I-95, expands to four lanes in the southbound direction, and has an interchange with Woodward Avenue and the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 337|Route 337]], that also provides access to [[Tweed New Haven Airport]]; there is no southbound exit at this interchange.\n\nPast this interchange, the freeway enters the town of [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]], where US 1 parallels the highway on the both sides as a frontage road as the southbound direction narrows back to three lanes, before coming to a northbound and southbound exit with that route. Within the interchange, it also crosses the Northeast Corridor. A short distance later, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with [[Connecticut Route 100|Route 100]] before the road curves east across [[Saltonstall Mountain]] and [[Lake Saltonstall (Connecticut)|Lake Saltonstall]], and comes into the the town of [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. Within this area, I-95 passes through the [[Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge]] where it comes to an northbound exit and southbound entrance with the [[Branford Connector]], that connects to US 1, [[Connecticut Route 142|Route 142]], and [[Connecticut Route 146|Route 146]] near [[Short Beach]]. Just after the connector, there is a service plaza in both directions, and the freeway then reaches an interchange with Cedar Street north of the center of Branford. From here, the road narrows to four lanes and continues east into more rural and wooded surroundings, coming to an interchange with US 1 on the east side of town. I-95 briefly enters a commercial area around its interchange with Leetes Island Road, which leads south to the [[Stony Creek (Branford)|Stony Creek]] neighborhood.\n\nThe freeway heads back into wooded areas as it enters the town of [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], where it comes to interchanges with US 1, [[Connecticut Route 77|Route 77]], and Goose Lane, north of Guilford Center. The road continues east across the East River marshlands, and comes into the town of [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]], where it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Mungertown Road, prior to crossing the Neck River. The road heads to the north of Madison Center, where it has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 79|Route 79]] with a park and ride lot in its northeastern corner. Past Route 79, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, and reaches an interchange with the [[Hammonasset Connector]], which provides access to [[Hammonasset Beach State Park]]. At this point, the route crosses over the [[Hammonasset River]] and leaves New Haven County.\n\n===Middlesex County===\n\nUpon crossing the river, I-95 comes into [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]], [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] continuing east through rural surroundings with some suburban elements. The freeway reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 81|Route 81]], close to the center of town adjacent to the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets outlet mall, to the northwest of the interchange. From here, the road makes a reverse turn across the Menunketesuck River, after which it enters the town of [[Westbrook, Connecticut|Westbrook]] and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 145|Route 145]]. At this point, I-95 makes another reverse turn before turning east again, at the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 153|Route 153]] that also provides access to the Westbrook Outlets outlet mall, just north of Westbrook Center. The freeway then reaches a pair of roadside stops, in which the northbound direction has a rest area and welcome center, and the southbound direction has access to Troop F of the [[Connecticut State Police]], just before coming to the interchange for [[Connecticut Route 166|Route 166]], where it enters the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]. Within Old Saybrook, the road turns northeast, and has a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Elm Street, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrances with [[Connecticut Route 154|Route 154]] northwest of Old Saybrook Center. On the east side of town, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95 and joins the route in a concurrency, as it widens to six lanes, and comes to a trumpet interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]], which heads northwest from I-95/US 1 as a four-lane freeway parallel to the [[Connecticut River]], towards [[Greater Hartford]]. A short distance later, the two routes cross the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]], that has a fourth southbound lane, over the Connecticut River and leave both Old Saybrook and Middlesex County.\n\n===New London County===\n\nOn the crossing of the Connecticut River, I-95/US 1 comes into [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[New London County, Connecticut|New London County]] and immediately narrows to three southbound lanes, as it reaches the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 156|Route 156]] and Lyme Street, where US 1 exits the highway and the concurrency ends. The freeway reduces to four lanes and heads into a heavily forested area with little development around the highway, where it crosses the [[Duck River (Connecticut)|Duck River]]. The road crosses the Threemile River prior to crossing the Fourmile River, within its interchange with the namesake road, as it enters the town of [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]. I-95 immediately comes to a trumpet interchange with the Rocky Neck Connector, that provides access to the [[Rocky Neck State Park]]. Continuing northeast through the center of East Lyme, the freeway enters into areas of mixed development with suburban elements around its interchange with Society Road, before crossing the Pattagansett River within its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 161|Route 161]], in the village of Flanders. Shorty afterward, there is an interchange with US 1, before the road crosses the [[Niantic River]] just before its northbound exit and southbound entrance with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|I-395]]. Here, the Connecticut Turnpike splits to the northeast along the four-lane I-395 freeway, which heads toward [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]], and eventually [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Meanwhile, I-95 turns east along the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and leaves the town of East Lyme.\n\nPast I-395, the freeway comes into the town of [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Oil Mill Road, just east of the split. A short distance later, the road reaches an interchange with Cross Road as it heads into suburban-like commercial areas. I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] before curving southeast to meet right-in/right-out interchanges with Frontage Road that connects to Vauxhall Street. From there, the freeway enters the city of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] as it gains a third northbound lane, where Frontage Road serves as a collector/distributor road for the interchanges within the city. These interchanges include one with US 1, where that route northbound merges onto the Frontage Road, another with Briggs Street, where the southbound direction gains a third lane, and then another with [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and Williams Street/Huntington Street which provide access to the downtown area and the New London Waterfront District. Past this interchange, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95, and the two routes turn east to run concurrent across the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge]], which has ten lanes, over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], where the highways come into the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Before the end of the bridge, Northbound US 1 exits the highway providing access to an exit for Thames Street, which leads into Downtown Groton. The freeway narrows to six lanes as it reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 12|Route 12]] and the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], which also provides access to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]; the interchange has no northbound entrance. A short distance later, the road reverse turns through a directional interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], which spurs into the downtown area. Past Route 349, the median widens, after many miles of having a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle of the highway, and it heads into forested surroundings. In the eastern part of Groton, I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and Allyn Street/Mystic Street, both of which lead south to the village of [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]] and north to the town of [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]]. From here, the freeway passes a northbound scenic overlook, and crosses the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]] leaving Groton.\n\n[[File:Hoxie overlook ct.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Panoramic view from the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook, March 2006]]\nUpon crossing the Mystic River, the road enters the town of [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]], where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] within the village of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], that provides access to [[Mystic Seaport]] as well as the Olde Mistick Village shopping mall and the [[Mystic Aquarium]] located at the southeastern corner of the interchange. At this point, I-95 reduces to four lanes, and turns northeast passing wooded areas with some residences, and comes to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] north of the center of Stonington, with a park and ride lot being located in the northwest corner of the interchange. From here, the freeway continues northeast to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]]/[[Connecticut Route 49|Route 49]], providing access to the village of [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]] to the south and a park and ride lot to the north in the middle of the interchange. Also, within the interchange, the southbound direction has a rest area and welcome center and the road comes into the town of [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]]. I-95 continues to its last exit in Connecticut, being the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 216|Route 216]] and the eastern terminus of Route 184, as the median narrows. Immediately after this interchange, the freeway leaves Connecticut and continues as a four-lane freeway northeast into [[Rhode Island]] towards [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\n==History==\nI-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway\u2014to ease traffic congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]] by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of US&nbsp;1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened c. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened c. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut\u2013Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref> Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over {{convert|11,900|USgal|l}} of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\nInterstate upgrades include:\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, [[Dunkin Donuts]], and Subway shops. [[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\nMass transit upgrade projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]\u2013Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers are currently sequential, but will be changed to mileage-based in the future.\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=45\n|location=Byram\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|95|dir1=south|name1=[[New England Thruway]]|city1=New York City}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=0.80\n|exit=2\n|road=Delavan Avenue \u2013 [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=2.00\n|type=closed\n|place=Former toll plaza\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=CDP\n|mile=2.54\n|exit=3\n|road=Arch Street \u2013 [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Cos Cob\n|mile=3.73\n|exit=4\n|road=Indian Field Road \u2013 [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit|state=CT\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=town\n|mile=4.35\n|mile2=4.85\n|bridge=[[Mianus River Bridge]] over the [[Mianus River]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Riverside\n|mile=5.53\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=CT|US|1|city1=Riverside|city2=Old Greenwich|city3=Mianus}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=4\n|mile=6.50\n|mile2=6.62\n|exit=6\n|road=Harvard Avenue<hr>West Avenue \n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance<hr>Southbound exit and northbound entrance}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=7.34\n|exit=7\n|road={{jct|state=CT|to1=To|Route|137|dir1=North|road=Greenwich Avenue}}\n|notes=Access via Washington Boulevard ([[Special Service Road 493 (Connecticut)|SSR 493]]);

I-95 from [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] to [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]] is part of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]], during which it passes through the major cities of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]].  After leaving the turnpike in East Lyme, I-95 is known as the '''Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway''' and passes through [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], and [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], before exiting the state through [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]] at the [[Rhode Island]] border.\n\n==Route description==\n[[File:I-95 at I-395, East Lyme, CT.jpg|left|thumb|I-95 at the I-395 exit at the East Lyme\u2013Waterford town line]]\nI-95 follows [[Connecticut Turnpike]] from the [[New York (state)|New York]] state line eastward for {{convert|88|mi|km}}.

Upon entering Connecticut, the highway is a six-lane freeway known as the Connecticut Turnpike, a name that remains despite the fact that tolls were removed from the road in 1988. The road is paralleled by [[Metro North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]] to the northwest, which also carries [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which it follows for much of its length throughout the state. I-95 heads northeast, coming to an interchange with Delevan Avenue about a half mile from the state line. The freeway continues through the affluent suburban development of the [[Gold Coast (Connecticut)|Gold Coast]] of southwestern Fairfield County, reaching a [[weigh station]] in the northbound direction, before turning east-northeast and coming to an interchange with Arch Street to the south of downtown Greenwich. The road heads in the neighborhood of [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] where it has an interchange with Indian Field Road, before it crosses over the New Haven Line and the [[Mianus River]], on the [[Mianus River Bridge]]. Past the river, I-95 comes to a trumpet interchange which provides access to [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US&nbsp;1]] between the neighborhoods [[Riverside, Connecticut|Riverside]] and [[Old Greenwich, Connecticut|Old Greenwich]].\n\nAfter this interchange, the freeway enters the city of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and immediately interchanges with Harvard Avenue/West Avenue on the city's [[West Side of Stamford|West Side]]. The road crosses the [[Rippowam River]] and enters the dense commercial area of [[Downtown Stamford]], where it briefly becomes elevated. In this area, ramps from I-95 exist at a northbound exit to Greenwich Avenue, a southbound entrance from Washington Boulevard, a northbound exit and entrance and southbound exit to Canal Street, and a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Elm Street, the former three of which provide access to [[Connecticut Route 137|Route&nbsp;137]]. At this point, the freeway immediately crosses over the New Haven Line and crosses into the residential [[East Side of Stamford]], where there is an interchange with US 1 that also provides access to [[Connecticut Route 106|Route 106]], adjacent to the southbound entrance ramp.\n\nAfter this point, the southbound direction gains a fourth lane as the road enters the town of [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], where there is a service plaza in the southbound direction, prior to the interchange with Noroton Avenue in the community of [[Noroton, Connecticut|Noroton]]; the southbound entrance has an outlet to the [[Noroton Heights station]] on the New Haven Line. Near the center of town, the southbound direction narrows to three lanes again, and I-95 has interchanges with US 1 and [[Connecticut Route 136|Route 136]], in which the latter junction is a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance. Next, the freeway turns to the northeast passing over the New Haven Line and coming to a service plaza and welcome center in the northbound direction, before reaching another interchange with US 1, that lacks a northbound entrance. \n\nImmediately after, the road comes into the city of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] in the neighborhood of [[South Norwalk]]. In the area, I-95 has ramps at a southbound exit and entrance and a northbound entrance to US 1/Scribner Avenue and a northbound exit to Fairfield Avenue, the latter of which provides access to the [[Maritime Aquarium at Norwalk]]. The freeway turns east-northeast as it comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|US 7]], where there is also a southbound exit ramp to West Avenue, crossing the [[Danbury Branch]] of the New Haven Line within the interchange, before crossing the [[Norwalk River]], on the [[Yankee Doodle Bridge]]. Past the crossing, the road immediately meets the interchange with East Avenue in [[East Norwalk]].\n\nI-95 enters the town of [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]], just prior to reaching an interchange with the southern terminus [[Connecticut Route 33|Route 33]] and Route 136. Past this interchange, the freeway proceeds to cross over the [[Saugatuck River]] and continues to an interchange with the Sherwood Island Connector, which provides access to US 1 and [[Sherwood Island State Park]]. The road curves through wooded residential areas, where it comes into the town of [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]. Here, I-95 reaches an interchange with US 1/Center Street which serve the neighborhood of [[Southport, Connecticut|Southport]]. Shortly after, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Bronson Road just before the crossing of the [[Mill River (Fairfield, Connecticut)|Mill River]]. Passing to the north of [[Fairfield Center]], the freeway comes to an interchange with Mill Plain Road, before reaching a service plaza in both directions, where there also exists northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps to Round Hill Road. The other half component of this interchange is with [[Connecticut Route 135|Route 135]], and both provide access to the main campus of [[Fairfield University]]. From this point, the road curves through an interchange with US 1, before reaching another interchange with the Black Rock Turnpike on the eastern edge of town.\n\nFollowing the Black Rock Turnpike, I-95 enters the city of [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], which is both the largest city in Fairfield County, and the state of Connecticut. On the city's West Side, the freeway has an interchange with State Street Extension and [[Connecticut Route 130|Route 130]], where it becomes elevated and gains a fourth southbound lane, as it passes through the industrial areas of the city's southwestern neighborhoods. Within that interchange, the road also crosses the New Haven Line. Further within the area, I-95 comes to an interchange with Wordin Avenue, before it crosses over the New Haven Line again and passes to south of downtown Bridgeport. Here, the freeway has a small interchange complex with both Lafayette Boulevard which provides access to many of the city's major landmarks in the South End and downtown area, and with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 8|Route 8]]/[[Connecticut Route 25|Route 25]] which head north from I-95 as a four-lane freeway. From this point, the road narrows to three lanes in the southbound direction, and comes onto to the [[P.T. Barnum Bridge]] which carries it over the New Haven Line, adjacent to the [[Bridgeport station]], and the [[Pequonnock River]]. On the bridge, the northbound direction gains a fourth lane, as it comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance to [[Connecticut Route 127|Route 127]] on Bridgeport's east side, after it passes over Route 130. I-95 reduces back to three lanes in the northbound direction, as it curves into the city's East End, where there is an interchange for Route 130 and Seaview Avenue.\n\nA short distance later, the freeway reaches a northbound exit and southbound entrance to [[Connecticut Route 113|Route 113]], within which, the highway enters the town of [[Stratford, Connecticut|Stratford]]. Route 113 provides access to the [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]], while the other half component of the interchange is with Surf Avenue. Afterward, the road turns to the northeast coming to an interchange with Honeyspot Road/South Avenue. A short distance later, I-95 reaches an interchange with Broad Street, within downtown Stratford that also provides access to Route 113. The freeway heads into a commercial area, where it has a northbound exit and southbound entrance serving US 1 and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 110|Route 110]], before crossing the [[Housatonic River]] on the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]], where the route leaves Fairfield County.\n\n===New Haven County===\n\nOn the Moses Wheeler Bridge, I-95 crosses into [[Milford, Connecticut|Milford]], [[New Haven County, Connecticut|New Haven County]], where it heads into residential areas on the other side of the river. Here, the freeway has a trumpet interchange with US 1, within the village of [[Devon (Milford)|Devon]], before it crosses the New Haven Line and reaches another interchange with Schoolhouse Road/Sub Way, in which the latter road is named for the world headquarters of the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] restaurant chain. The road continues northeast through wooded areas of the western part of Milford, where it has a full interchange with Plains Road, and a northbound exit and southbound entrance with High Street, before reaching the interchange with the [[Milford Parkway]] to the northeast of Downtown Milford. The Milford Parkway, a four-lane limited access parkway, provides access from I-95, as well as US 1 to [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which are both components of [[Connecticut Route 15|Route 15]]. Access exists only to and from the direction of Route 15, and commercial vehicles are prohibited. The freeway enters a reverse turn, where it comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1 adjacent to the [[Connecticut Post Mall]], located at the northeastern corner of the interchange. The road heads northeast again into commercial surroundings, coming to an interchange with Old Gate Lane/Woodmont Road. From here, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, before coming into the town of [[Orange, Connecticut|Orange]], where it reaches an interchange with Marsh Hill Road. The overpass carrying Marsh Hill Road is called the [[Salemme Memorial Bridge]], and the exit provides access to the West Campus of [[Yale University]].\n\nThe road passes to the northwest of the university campus as it enters the city of [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]]. Here, I-95 passes mixed areas of suburban development, where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 162|Route 162]]. Thru trucks to Downtown West Haven must use this exit, as trucks may not use the northbound exit ramp at the next interchange, for Campbell Avenue and the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 122|Route 122]], due to its steep incline. The road makes another reverse turn, where it crosses the New Haven Line and the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]], and comes into the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]. Immediately after crossing the river, I-95 comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], which provides access to the [[Yale Bowl]] and connects to [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]]. From this point, the freeway heads northeast, passing a right-in/right-out interchange with Long Wharf Drive in the northbound direction, and Sargent Drive in the southbound direction along [[New Haven Harbor]], in the neighborhood of [[Long Wharf (New Haven)|Long Wharf]], before reaching the large interchange complex southeast of [[Downtown New Haven]]. The complex includes an interchange with a flyover ramp to M.L.K. Jr. Boulevard serving the downtown area, as well as the highway's split with [[Interstate 91|I-91]], which heads north-northeast from I-95 towards the [[Connecticut State Capitol]] at [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. Past I-91, the freeway turns southeast to cross the [[Quinnipiac River]] on the [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as simply the \"Q Bridge\". On the other side of the bridge, the road heads into another area of mixed development in [[The Annex (New Haven)|The Annex]] neighborhood. Here, I-95, expands to four lanes in the southbound direction, and has an interchange with Woodward Avenue and the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 337|Route 337]], that also provides access to [[Tweed New Haven Airport]]; there is no southbound exit at this interchange.\n\nPast this interchange, the freeway enters the town of [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]], where US 1 parallels the highway on the both sides as a frontage road as the southbound direction narrows back to three lanes, before coming to a northbound and southbound exit with that route. Within the interchange, it also crosses the Northeast Corridor. A short distance later, there is a southbound exit and northbound entrance with [[Connecticut Route 100|Route 100]] before the road curves east across [[Saltonstall Mountain]] and [[Lake Saltonstall (Connecticut)|Lake Saltonstall]], and comes into the the town of [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]]. Within this area, I-95 passes through the [[Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge]] where it comes to an northbound exit and southbound entrance with the [[Branford Connector]], that connects to US 1, [[Connecticut Route 142|Route 142]], and [[Connecticut Route 146|Route 146]] near [[Short Beach]]. Just after the connector, there is a service plaza in both directions, and the freeway then reaches an interchange with Cedar Street north of the center of Branford. From here, the road narrows to four lanes and continues east into more rural and wooded surroundings, coming to an interchange with US 1 on the east side of town. I-95 briefly enters a commercial area around its interchange with Leetes Island Road, which leads south to the [[Stony Creek (Branford)|Stony Creek]] neighborhood.\n\nThe freeway heads back into wooded areas as it enters the town of [[Guilford, Connecticut|Guilford]], where it comes to interchanges with US 1, [[Connecticut Route 77|Route 77]], and Goose Lane, north of Guilford Center. The road continues east across the East River marshlands, and comes into the town of [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]], where it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Mungertown Road, prior to crossing the Neck River. The road heads to the north of Madison Center, where it has an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 79|Route 79]] with a park and ride lot in its northeastern corner. Past Route 79, I-95 passes service plazas in both directions, and reaches an interchange with the [[Hammonasset Connector]], which provides access to [[Hammonasset Beach State Park]]. At this point, the route crosses over the [[Hammonasset River]] and leaves New Haven County.\n\n===Middlesex County===\n\nUpon crossing the river, I-95 comes into [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]], [[Middlesex County, Connecticut|Middlesex County]] continuing east through rural surroundings with some suburban elements. The freeway reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 81|Route 81]], close to the center of town adjacent to the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets outlet mall, to the northwest of the interchange. From here, the road makes a reverse turn across the Menunketesuck River, after which it enters the town of [[Westbrook, Connecticut|Westbrook]] and reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 145|Route 145]]. At this point, I-95 makes another reverse turn before turning east again, at the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 153|Route 153]] that also provides access to the Westbrook Outlets outlet mall, just north of Westbrook Center. The freeway then reaches a pair of roadside stops, in which the northbound direction has a rest area and welcome center, and the southbound direction has access to Troop F of the [[Connecticut State Police]], just before coming to the interchange for [[Connecticut Route 166|Route 166]], where it enters the town of [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]. Within Old Saybrook, the road turns northeast, and has a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Elm Street, as well as a northbound exit and southbound entrances with [[Connecticut Route 154|Route 154]] northwest of Old Saybrook Center. On the east side of town, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95 and joins the route in a concurrency, as it widens to six lanes, and comes to a trumpet interchange with the southern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 9|Route 9]], which heads northwest from I-95/US 1 as a four-lane freeway parallel to the [[Connecticut River]], towards [[Greater Hartford]]. A short distance later, the two routes cross the [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]], that has a fourth southbound lane, over the Connecticut River and leave both Old Saybrook and Middlesex County.\n\n===New London County===\n\nOn the crossing of the Connecticut River, I-95/US 1 comes into [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[New London County, Connecticut|New London County]] and immediately narrows to three southbound lanes, as it reaches the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 156|Route 156]] and Lyme Street, where US 1 exits the highway and the concurrency ends. The freeway reduces to four lanes and heads into a heavily forested area with little development around the highway, where it crosses the [[Duck River (Connecticut)|Duck River]]. The road crosses the Threemile River prior to crossing the Fourmile River, within its interchange with the namesake road, as it enters the town of [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]]. I-95 immediately comes to a trumpet interchange with the Rocky Neck Connector, that provides access to the [[Rocky Neck State Park]]. Continuing northeast through the center of East Lyme, the freeway enters into areas of mixed development with suburban elements around its interchange with Society Road, before crossing the Pattagansett River within its interchange with [[Connecticut Route 161|Route 161]], in the village of Flanders. Shorty afterward, there is an interchange with US 1, before the road crosses the [[Niantic River]] just before its northbound exit and southbound entrance with [[Interstate 395 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|I-395]]. Here, the Connecticut Turnpike splits to the northeast along the four-lane I-395 freeway, which heads toward [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]], [[Plainfield, Connecticut|Plainfield]], and eventually [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. Meanwhile, I-95 turns east along the Jewish War Veterans Memorial Highway and leaves the town of East Lyme.\n\nPast I-395, the freeway comes into the town of [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] and comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance to Oil Mill Road, just east of the split. A short distance later, the road reaches an interchange with Cross Road as it heads into suburban-like commercial areas. I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 85|Route 85]] before curving southeast to meet right-in/right-out interchanges with Frontage Road that connects to Vauxhall Street. From there, the freeway enters the city of [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] as it gains a third northbound lane, where Frontage Road serves as a collector/distributor road for the interchanges within the city. These interchanges include one with US 1, where that route northbound merges onto the Frontage Road, another with Briggs Street, where the southbound direction gains a third lane, and then another with [[Connecticut Route 32|Route 32]] and Williams Street/Huntington Street which provide access to the downtown area and the New London Waterfront District. Past this interchange, US 1 merges onto northbound I-95, and the two routes turn east to run concurrent across the [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge]], which has ten lanes, over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], where the highways come into the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]]. Before the end of the bridge, Northbound US 1 exits the highway providing access to an exit for Thames Street, which leads into Downtown Groton. The freeway narrows to six lanes as it reaches an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 12|Route 12]] and the western terminus of [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], which also provides access to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]]; the interchange has no northbound entrance. A short distance later, the road reverse turns through a directional interchange with the northern terminus of [[Connecticut Route 349|Route 349]], which spurs into the downtown area. Past Route 349, the median widens, after many miles of having a [[jersey barrier]] in the middle of the highway, and it heads into forested surroundings. In the eastern part of Groton, I-95 interchanges with [[Connecticut Route 117|Route 117]] and Allyn Street/Mystic Street, both of which lead south to the village of [[Noank, Connecticut|Noank]] and north to the town of [[Ledyard, Connecticut|Ledyard]]. From here, the freeway passes a northbound scenic overlook, and crosses the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]] leaving Groton.\n\n[[File:Hoxie overlook ct.jpg|center|thumb|700px|Panoramic view from the Jerome Hoxie Scenic Overlook, March 2006]]\nUpon crossing the Mystic River, the road enters the town of [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]], where it comes to an interchange with [[Connecticut Route 27|Route 27]] within the village of [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]], that provides access to [[Mystic Seaport]] as well as the Olde Mistick Village shopping mall and the [[Mystic Aquarium]] located at the southeastern corner of the interchange. At this point, I-95 reduces to four lanes, and turns northeast passing wooded areas with some residences, and comes to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 234|Route 234]] north of the center of Stonington, with a park and ride lot being located in the northwest corner of the interchange. From here, the freeway continues northeast to an interchange for [[Connecticut Route 2|Route 2]]/[[Connecticut Route 49|Route 49]], providing access to the village of [[Pawcatuck, Connecticut|Pawcatuck]] to the south and a park and ride lot to the north in the middle of the interchange. Also, within the interchange, the southbound direction has a rest area and welcome center and the road comes into the town of [[North Stonington, Connecticut|North Stonington]]. I-95 continues to its last exit in Connecticut, being the interchange with [[Connecticut Route 216|Route 216]] and the eastern terminus of Route 184, as the median narrows. Immediately after this interchange, the freeway leaves Connecticut and continues as a four-lane freeway northeast into [[Rhode Island]] towards [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\n==History==\nI-95 in Connecticut has far more exits than typical Interstate Highways, particularly in Fairfield and New Haven Counties, with some exits less than one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) apart. State transportation officials have said that the reason for the many exits stems from the state's original justification for building parts of the highway\u2014to ease traffic congestion on [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|US 1]] by providing a faster alternate route, even for drivers traveling short distances within the same community. To overcome potential opposition to the highway from towns through which the route would traverse, the state agreed to guarantee each affected town a certain number of access points to the highway. Rather than skirting urban areas, the highway was built directly through the most dense sections of Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport, and New Haven.\n\nWhile most of I-95 was built as the Connecticut Turnpike, the route incorporated several pieces of already-built relocations, some to [[freeway]] standards, of US&nbsp;1 (the turnpike split from the US 1 relocation in [[East Lyme, Connecticut|East Lyme]], along the Old Lyme-New London section):\n*[[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] bypass, opened c. 1952\n*New Haven east of the [[Quinnipiac River]], opened c. 1951\n*[[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]]-[[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], [[Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge]] over the [[Connecticut River]] and approaches, opened 1948\n*Old Lyme-New London, opened by 1950 as a two-lane road\n*New London-[[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] [[Gold Star Memorial Bridge|Gold Star Bridge]] over the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]] and approaches, opened 1943\nOther improvements in the corridor included the [[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]] [[Merritt Parkway]]/[[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], New Haven-Old Saybrook [[Connecticut Route 80|Route 80]], and Groton-Rhode Island [[Connecticut Route 184|Route 184]], the latter connecting in Rhode Island to [[Rhode Island Route 3|Route 3]], a shortcut to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]].\n\nMost of the turnpike opened January 2, 1958, and was designated I-95 south and west of the split with the relocated US 1 by 1959. The rest of I-95 from I-395 to the Connecticut\u2013Rhode Island border opened December 12, 1964. The Gold Star Bridge was twinned c. 1975, along with a reconstruction of its approaches, and in 1993 the Raymond E. Baldwin Bridge was replaced with a wider span.\n\nThe state installed cameras to watch traffic along the highway in the early 1990s. As of 2007, about 100 cameras have been set up and are monitored by state police and the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]] (ConnDOT). In [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], local emergency responders (fire departments and ambulance services) that serve the highway in individual towns have asked for direct feeds from the cameras to avoid mistakes. When travelers report an accident, they sometimes tell authorities that it occurred near an exit that is actually not the nearest to the scene, slowing down response time. The traffic feed from the cameras is available on the World Wide Web, but the service can be spotty, according to the [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] and [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] fire chiefs, who said they were hoping that a proposed $40 million upgrade of the camera system, under consideration by the state in 2007, would provide them access.<ref>{{cite news |last = Ginocchio |first = Mark |title = Local Leaders Want Access to DOT cameras |work = [[The Advocate (Stamford)|The Advocate]] |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = July 15, 2007 |pages = A1, A6 }}</ref> Feeds from these cameras are also used by local media outlets, as part of traffic report segments in news programming, and in some instances as a part of a designated traffic and weather channel.\n\n===Disasters===\nIn January 1983, a truck with a brake failure slammed into a line of cars waiting to pay a toll on I-95 in Stratford; seven people were killed. This accident helped lead to the removal of toll barriers throughout Connecticut, which was completed six years after.\n\nOn the morning of June 28, 1983, a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the [[Mianus River Bridge]] in [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]] collapsed, plunging northbound I-95 traffic into the [[Mianus River]] below, killing three. The collapse was blamed on the failure of the steel pins to hold the horizontal beams together and inadequate inspection prior to the collapse. Northbound traffic was diverted on this section of I-95 for 25 days. Southbound traffic was unaffected.\n\nOn March 26, 2004, a bridge on I-95 in Bridgeport was partly melted by the explosion of a [[tanker truck]] carrying over {{convert|11,900|USgal|l}} of [[fuel oil]]. Repairs were estimated to take at least two weeks, but the highway was opened to northbound traffic in only a few days. Southbound traffic resumed about a week later after a temporary bridge was installed to carry traffic while the destroyed bridge was rebuilt.\n\nAt 10:20 a.m. on November 2, 2007, a [[tanker truck]] carrying [[heating oil]] plowed over the divider, knocking the side of a [[tractor trailer]] and striking several other cars in its path. Three people were killed, including the driver of the tanker and the occupants of two cars that were completely destroyed in the crash. The driver of the tractor trailer survived (his canine companion emerged completely unharmed) but the trailer was split open. At least three other cars were involved in this accident. A part of the road was damaged and took until the next morning to fully reopen, partly due to a cleanup after the accident.\n\n===Construction plans===\nWhile the corridor was designated \"High Priority Corridor 65\" in 2005, work along Interstate 95 in Connecticut has been ongoing for nearly 30 years.\n\nInterstate upgrades include:\n*Replace the bridge over the Connecticut River in Saybrook (completed in 1993)\n*Replace the bridge over the [[Saugatuck River]] in [[Westport, Connecticut|Westport]] (completed in 2001)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 through [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] (completed in 2006)\n*Upgrade the median divider from New York state line to [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] to meet current safety standards (segmented construction ongoing since 1993)\n*Construction of a new extradosed [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Q Bridge]] (Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge) over the [[Quinnipiac River]] (completed in 2015)\n*Reconfiguring the interchange between [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]], I-95, and [[Connecticut Route 34|Route 34]] in New Haven (completed in 2016)\n*Replace bridge over the [[West River (Connecticut)|West River]] in New Haven (completed in June 2018). Exit 44, southbound, was closed in April 2015, and the remaining ramps at Exit 45, northbound, and southbound were realigned and renumbered Exit 44.\n*Reconstruct I-95/[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|I-395]] interchange in Waterford to accommodate proposed [[Connecticut Route 11|Route 11 Expressway]] connection (proposed).\n*Replacement of the [[Moses Wheeler Bridge]] over the [[Housatonic River]] (underway)\n*Widening and reconstruction of I-95 between [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]&nbsp;\u2014 in December 2007 a 15-month, $5.5 million project was completed to add fourth (or \"operational\") lanes in each direction between the entrances and exits at exits 10 and 11 in Darien. This project was completed in 2007. A similar project between exits 11 and 13 began in 2008 and was completed in 2010. An earlier project added a fourth lane on the southbound side from the entrance at exit 10 to exit 8. After that lane was added, a ConnDOT study concluded that accidents were down on that stretch of the highway by 20 percent, amounting to about 160 fewer accidents per year.<ref>{{cite news |last = Lucas |first = Jonathan |title = I-95 Lanes Open in Time for Holidays: Project Aims to Ease Congestion in Darien |work = The Advocate |location = Stamford, Connecticut |date = December 8, 2007 |pages = A1, A4 |edition = Norwalk }}</ref>\n*Widen I-95 mainline from Branford to the [[Rhode Island]] state line (proposed)\n*Adding an operational lane between exits 14 and 15 in Norwalk (completed in 2016)\n[[File:Connecticut Turnpike - Fairfield Service Plaza.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Fairfield Service Plaza (Southbound) in 2018]]\n*From 2011 to 2015, all 10 of the service plazas along I-95 were rebuilt (pairs of plazas are located in Darien, Fairfield, Milford, Branford, and Madison, with a separate plaza for each direction of I-95). All of the renovated plazas feature modernized Mobil gas stations, Alltown convenience stores, [[Dunkin Donuts]], and Subway shops. [[McDonald's]] is also available at eight of the ten plazas, while the largest plazas additionally feature [[Sbarro]], [[Panda Express]] and various other quick-service options. The last of the plazas to be rebuilt, southbound in Madison, opened in August 2015.\n\nMass transit upgrade projects have been undertaken in large part to reduce traffic on the highway, which is often congested, particularly in Fairfield County:\n*New [[Fairfield Metro (Metro-North station)|train station]] near the [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]\u2013Bridgeport city line (completed in 2011, fully operational in January 2012)\n*Intermodal Transportation Center in Bridgeport (completed)\n*New [[West Haven (Metro-North station)|train station]] in [[West Haven, Connecticut|West Haven]] (completed)\n*Upgrade [[overhead lines|catenary power lines]] along the New Haven Line (underway through the 2010s)\n*New [[Madison (Shore Line East station)|train station]] in [[Madison, Connecticut|Madison]] (completed)\n*Purchase new [[railroad car]]s and refurbish existing cars to increase capacity and reliability\n*Construct new [[Intermodal container|container]] [[barge]] ports at Bridgeport and New Haven\n*Expansion of [[Freight train|freight]] service on the New Haven Line\n*Replace outdated bridges and straighten various sections of the New Haven Line to allow higher operating speeds for [[Amtrak]] and Metro-North trains\n\n==Auxiliary routes==\n*[[Interstate 395 (Connecticut\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 395]] is I-95's only auxiliary route in Connecticut, which runs from the junction with I-95 in [[Waterford, Connecticut|Waterford]] north to the Massachusetts state line where it meets [[Interstate 90]] / [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]] south of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Exit list==\nExit numbers are currently sequential, but will be changed to mileage-based in the future.\n{{jcttop|exit|length_ref=}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|county=Fairfield\n|cspan=45\n|location=Byram\n|lspan=3\n|mile=0.00\n|exit=\u2013\n|road={{jct|state=NY|I|95|dir1=south|name1=[[New England Thruway]]|city1=New York City}}\n|notes=Continuation into [[New York (state)|New York]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=0.80\n|exit=2\n|road=Delavan Avenue \u2013 [[Byram, Connecticut|Byram]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|mile=2.00\n|type=closed\n|place=Former toll plaza\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=CDP\n|mile=2.54\n|exit=3\n|road=Arch Street \u2013 [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Cos Cob\n|mile=3.73\n|exit=4\n|road=Indian Field Road \u2013 [[Cos Cob, Connecticut|Cos Cob]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]]\n}}\n{{jctbridge|exit|state=CT\n|location=Greenwich\n|area=town\n|mile=4.35\n|mile2=4.85\n|bridge=[[Mianus River Bridge]] over the [[Mianus River]]\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Riverside\n|mile=5.53\n|exit=5\n|road={{jct|state=CT|US|1|city1=Riverside|city2=Old Greenwich|city3=Mianus}}\n}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|location=Stamford\n|lspan=4\n|mile=6.50\n|mile2=6.62\n|exit=6\n|road=Harvard Avenue<hr>West Avenue \n|notes=Northbound exit and southbound entrance<hr>Southbound exit and northbound entrance}}\n{{CTint|exit\n|type=incomplete\n|mile=7.34\n|exit=7\n|road={{jct|state=CT|to1=To|Route|137|dir1=North|road=Greenwich Avenue}}\n|notes=Access via Washington Boulevard ([[Special Service Road 493 (Connecticut)|SSR 493]]);

Although variants of roadshow releases occasionally still exist, the practice mostly ended in the early 1970s.\n\nAs far as is known, virtually all of the films given roadshow releases were subsequently distributed to regular movie theaters. This was called a general release, and was akin to the modern-day [[wide release]] of a film. However, there are five important differences between a roadshow presentation of a film and today's [[limited release]]s:\n\n* Roadshow theatrical releases almost always placed a ten to fifteen-minute [[intermission]] between the two \"acts\" of the film, and the first act was frequently longer than the second.\n* Films shown as roadshow releases, especially those made between 1952 and 1974, were nearly always longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. Examples include ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963). There were no [[short subject]]s accompanying the film, and rarely any [[trailer (promotion)|movie trailer]]s.\n* Roadshow presentations were always shown on a one or two-performance a day, reserved seat basis, and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings. Unlike today's limited releases, seats ''had'' to be reserved; one could not simply buy a ticket at the box office and go in to watch the film. The two-performance-a-day screenings were usually limited to Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the rest of the week, the films would be shown only once a day. (However, in the case of ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'', there were three showings a day of the film on weekends, rather than two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/1999/59/rivoli/index.htm|title=The Rivoli Theatre|publisher=}}</ref>)\n* [[Programme (booklet)|Souvenir program]]s were often available at roadshow presentations of films, much as souvenir programs are made available when one goes to see the stage version of a play or musical. These movie souvenir programs contained photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on how the film was made, rather like today's \"extras\" on [[DVD]]s.\n* In the days of frequent roadshow releases, production companies and film distributors never used them to determine whether or not a film should be given a wide release, as is done today occasionally when films perform poorly at the box office. From the 1920s to the mid-1970s, a roadshow release would ''always'' play widely after its original engagements. This was true even of box office flops.\n\n==U.S. releases==\nThe roadshow format had been used since the days of [[silent film|silent]] films, but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives, who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home. Possibly, the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the French film ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth|Les Amours de la reine Elisabeth]]'' in America in 1912, a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nFilms shown in a roadshow format before 1951 included:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916)\n*''[[The Covered Wagon]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925)\n*''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927) , the first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Academy Award]] winner\n*''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927) , the first feature length part-talkie \n*''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), the silent film based on the play that inspired the [[Kander and Ebb]] Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film\n*''[[The Broadway Melody]]''(1929)\n*''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1929), a [[part-talkie]] based not on the 1927 stage musical but on Edna Ferber's original novel from which the musical was adapted\n*''[[Hollywood Revue of 1929|Hollywood Revue]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Paris (1929 film)|Paris]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Howard Hughes]]''<nowiki/>' [[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930)\n*''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), winner of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]\n*''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933)\n*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755216-2,00.html|title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Oct. 21, 1935|date=October 21, 1935|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n*''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936)\n*''[[In Old Chicago]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)\n*''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943)\n*''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n*''[[This Is the Army]]'' (1943) (shown only in roadshow format on initial release)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35613/warner-bros-and-the-homefront-collection/|title=Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n*''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944)\n*''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946) \n*''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947)\n*[[Ingrid Bergman]]''<nowiki/>'''s ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]''  (1948)\n*''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951).

The overture should not be confused with the main title music. The overture, recorded on film without a picture (and years later, on tape), was always played before the beginning of the film, while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed.  As the lights dimmed, the overture ended, the curtains opened, and the film began with its main title music and opening credits. Likewise, the exit music should not be confused with the end title music. The exit music, also recorded without a picture on film, was always played ''after'' the end of the film, while the lights were up and the curtains were closed. As the lights came on, the end title music ended, the curtains closed, and the exit music began. Most movie theaters until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen, and which would open when the show actually began and close when it ended.\n\n==Examples==\nAn early example of this was ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater.\n\nThe original theatrical release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''Fantasia'', presented in [[Fantasound]] in selected large cities in the United States, never had an overture, entr'acte, or exit music. Still, ''Fantasia'' was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience\u2014the printed souvenir program, given out to patrons as they entered the theater, presented the film's credits.\n\nThe original New York run of the English-language film ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1950), starring [[Jose Ferrer]] and based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s 1897 French play, was likewise presented in a roadshow format (that is, one or two performances a day), although the film is only two hours long, was not produced on a large budget, and does not contain an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=Crowther |first=Bosley | authorlink= Bosley Crowther | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9506EFD61738E73ABC4F52DFB767838B649EDE  |title='Cyrano,' With Jose Ferrer in Title Role and Mala Powers as Roxane, Opens at the Bijou |publisher= The New York Times |date=1950-11-17 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 ''Show Boat'']] was also shown in a roadshow format in some theaters, despite being less than two hours long, and not having an overture, intermission, entr'acte, or exit music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr2.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - Cinerama Wing 2|publisher=}}</ref> \n\n===1950s to 1970s===\nWith the rise of television, beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s, studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theaters by making widescreen epics, again using the \"roadshow\" formula. Films shot in [[3D film|3D]] sometimes were also shown in a roadshow format with intermission, regardless of actual length, as well as many films shot in various larger [[widescreen]] processes, such as [[CinemaScope]], [[Todd-AO]], [[Ultra Panavision 70|MGM Camera 65]], and [[Super Panavision 70]] were given roadshow presentations, as well as films that were blown up to 70mm from the 35mm negative.

Several of them, especially the musicals, were box-office flops that cost the studios fortunes, even if they had previously been hits as stage shows.\n\nSome of the films, such as the Olivier ''Othello'' or the Burton ''Hamlet'', were not even ''designed'' to be box-office smashes as films, but were merely meant to bring these productions to a wider public than could have seen them onstage, much as [[American Film Theatre]] would do in the mid-1970s.\n\nMany of these newer roadshow releases, including the Disney ''Sleeping Beauty'', were shown in six-track [[stereophonic sound]], a then non-standard feature of motion pictures. ''[[West Side Story (1961)\" although shown in 70mm and six track stereophonic sound, was shown with intermission with all 70MM prints as well as its 70MM re-releases, but was, in most areas, shown without one in order to increase the tension in the plot\u2014an idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves. The Special Limited Edition DVD release includes an option for watching the two-and-a-half hour film both with and without a break.\n\nSome films like ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' were often occasionally shown as roadshows for international releases, even if they weren't intended as roadshows for domestic release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gunsofnavarone.php|title=DVD Verdict Review\u2014The Guns Of Navarone: Collector's Edition|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', which had originally been shown in 35mm 4-Track stereophonic sound and without an overture, intermission and exit music, was re-released in a 70mm format with an overture, intermission and exit music, remixed into six-track stereophonic sound, and shown in a roadshow format. The film had originally been made in [[Cinemascope 55]] and through advances in technology was now able to be re-released in a process called [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur 70]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs7.htm|title=Widescreen Museum\u2014The CinemaScope Wing 7\u2014CinemaScope 55|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFilms made in three-camera [[Cinerama]] always received roadshow releases to show off the technology. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama\u2014a theater with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound\u2014made it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. [[Panavision]]).\n\nSince most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture, eventually, with the advent of anamorphic lenses, a number of Cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70MM film and with the extra-wide screens installed, normal 70MM theaters were able to play these reformatted Cinerama titles.\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format, three of them Shakespeare productions. One was ''Othello'' (1965), which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous Laurence Olivier 1964 London stage production, shot in a movie studio, but on enlarged stage settings. The nearly three-hour color film, made in Panavision and shown in 35MM and mono sound in many areas, was shown in 70MM and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement - in London in 1966,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |title=70mm Blow Up List 1966 - by |publisher=In70mm.com |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144618/http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nBeing a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture, the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted. In addition, while it had no overture, entr'acte music, or exit music, it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission, as nearly all roadshow releases were. However, it was shown in U.S. cinemas for an extremely limited release: only two days,<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E0D6163AEF34BC4A53DFB466838D679EDE |title= Minstrel Show 'Othello':Radical Makeup Marks Olivier's Interpretation |publisher= The New York Times |date=1966-02-02 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films.\n\nThe same was true of the Richard Burton ''Hamlet'', which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as ''Othello''. Filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called [[Electronovision]], which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast, this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release - no impressive scenery, no gorgeous color, no beautiful costumes, or stereophonic sound, only an intermission halfway through the performance. It was not even, strictly speaking, a full-scale film version of the play, but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], with a live audience. At three hours and eleven minutes, it was the longest film version of ''Hamlet'' to that date.\n\nAnother exception was Franco Zeffirelli's hugely successful 1968 version of ''Romeo and Juliet'', which, although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic, was shown in most areas in monaural sound (although its three [[soundtrack album]]s were all made in stereo) and was projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.66:1; that is, roughly the dimensions of today's average movie screen or HDTV screen, not the very wide screens required for films made in [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]], CinemaScope, Todd-AO or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period. However The Mexican release of the picture, DID feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70MM.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |title=70mm films in Mexico |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144721/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the film version of [[James Goldman]]'s ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968), although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements, instead of being released in 70MM and 6-track stereo sound - even though it was shown in Technicolor, it was only from 35MM Panavision (anamorphic) film and mono sound. Only in Australia and in its 1973 London re-release was the picture shown in both 70MM and stereophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1968/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1968 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1973/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1973 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> 1971's ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', another roadshow release, was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in Europe, while its U.S. release was in regular Panavision with monophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/technical|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/combined|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above, ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959), ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961) and ''The Longest Day'' (1962) were three epics that were shown in black and white instead of [[Technicolor]]. Before then, roadshow epics alternated between getting released in black and white or color.\n\n===Edited versions and restoration===\nIt was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced \"popular prices\", especially if the film ran longer than two hours. Sometimes this was done to a successful film, such as ''South Pacific'', but more often to one that had been a notable flop, in an effort to make it a success on its second run. As a result, some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release, as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists. With the work of [[film preservation|film preservationists and restoration]], such roadshow flops as ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1935), ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947), ''Joan of Arc'' (1948), '' A Star Is Born'' (1954) and ''Fantasia'' (1940), along with the hugely successful films ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943), ''Spartacus'', ''Lawrence of Arabia'', ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'', all of which had significant footage missing, have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers' original intent. However, several extremely popular long films, such as ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Ten Commandments'', have never been released in edited form, and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a-day basis.\n\n''In Old Chicago'', despite its roadshow presentation running only 110 minutes, was edited down to 95 minutes for general release, but restored to its full length on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/16907/in-old-chicago/|title=In Old Chicago|work=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\nFrequently, unless the film was exceptionally long, the intermission, along with the overture, ent'racte music, and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release, in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings, and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture. Often too, the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release.\n\n===Rise of the limited release===\nThe practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s, partly due to a string of costly box-office flops, and partly due to the rise of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]. As multiplexes began to increase in number, and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces, theater exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format. [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s Oscar-winning epics ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), for instance, were made with mono sound, shown without intermissions, and were given more than two performances a day, despite their extreme length. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) was shown more than twice a day, but included an intermission.\n\nAlthough some very long films such as ''Gone with the Wind'' would always be shown with an intermission and some films like ''[[Huckleberry Finn (1974 film)|Huckleberry Finn]]'' would be released with overtures until 1979, \"reserved seat\" showings of new films became extremely rare. The last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), a financial and critical disaster.\n\nIn the late 1970s, only three films (two popular and one a legendary disaster) received a reserved seat engagement. Michael Cimino made the successful film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', which was a commercial and critical success, winning the Oscar for Best Picture. In its initial run, it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1978/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1978 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> Francis Ford Coppola, director of ''[[The Godfather]]'', made ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best. The film had a difficult production history, and after five years of production it premiered in a U.S. reserved seat engagement in 70mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1979/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1979 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> It became a great financial success, and made even more money years later when the director's cut was released. Cimino's next film in 1980 was ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever. It had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission. The roadshow engagement was the shortest in history, for only three theaters held the screenings. Its New York run lasted three days, the Toronto run was shown once, and the Los Angeles engagement was cancelled.\n\nOne development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that, beginning with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films, even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars. Most films, however, were at that time still released only with mono sound. ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for example, made a mere two years before ''Star Wars'', was originally released in this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/jaws.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Jaws|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nAlthough as late as in 1982, the hugely successful ''[[Tootsie]]'' was also released with mono sound, as was the 1983 Best Picture winner ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/technical|title=Tootsie (1982)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/technical|title=Terms of Endearment (1983)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> By about 1984, mono sound was abandoned completely in American films, and stereo (often the six-track variety) finally became the norm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/combined|title=The Killing Fields (1984)|work=IMDb}}</ref>. However, 1982's ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' originally received 70mm releases with intermissions, due to their extreme lengths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/alternateversions|title=Gandhi (1982) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/alternateversions|title=Scarface (1983) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nBy 1984, the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned, as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable TV and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry. For example, ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' (1984), an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular [[Georges Bizet]] opera, was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission, despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage version's original division into four acts. The 1984 ''Carmen'' was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location, like many epics. \n\nEven though the format had died out, 1993's ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', 1996's ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' and 2003's ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' were screened with intermissions due to their extreme lengths on their original releases. While all three films had no official overture, entr'acte or exit music, cinemas choose to show the films accompanied with the commercially available film soundtracks playing as the audience entered and exited theaters. ''Gettysburg'' and ''Hamlet'' were screened with two screenings a day while ''Gods and Generals'' was not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030222intermissionae1p1.asp|title=Intermission: The pause that refreshes Just like old days, long film has break|website=old.post-gazette.com}}</ref>\n\nToday, a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common, mainly towards the end of the year, in order to qualify for film award consideration, including the [[Academy Awards]]. Such recent films that have gone the limited release route include ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' (2005), and the Disney film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' (2009); these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide.  Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called \"platforming\" or a [[platform release]].\n\nOccasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films. In 2006, the film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', based on the [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Broadway stage musical]], was given a three-theater road show release, with reserved seats and program guides. Tickets were significantly higher priced than normal, at $25.

Although variants of roadshow releases occasionally still exist, the practice mostly ended in the early 1970s.\n\nAs far as is known, virtually all of the films given roadshow releases were subsequently distributed to regular movie theaters. This was called a general release, and was akin to the modern-day [[wide release]] of a film. However, there are five important differences between a roadshow presentation of a film and today's [[limited release]]s:\n\n* Roadshow theatrical releases almost always placed a ten to fifteen-minute [[intermission]] between the two \"acts\" of the film, and the first act was frequently longer than the second.\n* Films shown as roadshow releases, especially those made between 1952 and 1974, were nearly always longer than the usual motion picture, lasting anywhere from slightly more than two hours to four hours or more, counting the intermission. Examples include ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'' (1956), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), or ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' (1963). There were no [[short subject]]s accompanying the film, and rarely any [[trailer (promotion)|movie trailer]]s.\n* Roadshow presentations were always shown on a one or two-performance a day, reserved seat basis, and admission prices were always higher than those of regular screenings. Unlike today's limited releases, seats ''had'' to be reserved; one could not simply buy a ticket at the box office and go in to watch the film. The two-performance-a-day screenings were usually limited to Wednesdays, Saturdays, and Sundays. During the rest of the week, the films would be shown only once a day. (However, in the case of ''[[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|Oklahoma!]]'', there were three showings a day of the film on weekends, rather than two.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/newsletter/1999/59/rivoli/index.htm|title=The Rivoli Theatre|publisher=}}</ref>)\n* [[Programme (booklet)|Souvenir program]]s were often available at roadshow presentations of films, much as souvenir programs are made available when one goes to see the stage version of a play or musical. These movie souvenir programs contained photos from the film, photos and biographies of its cast and principal crew, and information on how the film was made, rather like today's \"extras\" on [[DVD]]s.\n* In the days of frequent roadshow releases, production companies and film distributors never used them to determine whether or not a film should be given a wide release, as is done today occasionally when films perform poorly at the box office. From the 1920s to the mid-1970s, a roadshow release would ''always'' play widely after its original engagements. This was true even of box office flops.\n\n==U.S. releases==\nThe roadshow format had been used since the days of [[silent film|silent]] films, but the rise of widescreen and stereophonic sound in the 1950s made it especially attractive to studio executives, who hoped to lure audiences away from television by presenting films in a way that an audience at that time could never hope to see at home. Possibly, the first film ever shown in a roadshow engagement was the French film ''[[Les Amours de la reine \u00c9lisabeth|Les Amours de la reine Elisabeth]]'' in America in 1912, a 53-minute motion picture which starred the legendary stage actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]].\n\nFilms shown in a roadshow format before 1951 included:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916)\n*''[[The Covered Wagon]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923)\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1925)\n*''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925)\n*''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' (1927) , the first [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Academy Award]] winner\n*''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927) , the first feature length part-talkie \n*''[[Chicago (1927 film)|Chicago]]'' (1927), the silent film based on the play that inspired the [[Kander and Ebb]] Broadway musical and Oscar-winning film\n*''[[The Broadway Melody]]''(1929)\n*''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' (1929), a [[part-talkie]] based not on the 1927 stage musical but on Edna Ferber's original novel from which the musical was adapted\n*''[[Hollywood Revue of 1929|Hollywood Revue]]'' (1929)\n*''[[The Desert Song (1929 film)|The Desert Song]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Rio Rita (1929 film)|Rio Rita]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Paris (1929 film)|Paris]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Sally (1929 film)|Sally]]'' (1929)\n*''[[Howard Hughes]]''<nowiki/>' [[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930)\n*''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' (1932)\n*''[[Grand Hotel (1932 film)|Grand Hotel]]'' (1932), winner of the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]\n*''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933)\n*''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (1935 film)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1935)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755216-2,00.html|title=Cinema: The New Pictures: Oct. 21, 1935|date=October 21, 1935|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n*''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' (1936)\n*''[[In Old Chicago]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937)\n*''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939)\n*''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940)\n*''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943)\n*''[[The Song of Bernadette (film)|The Song of Bernadette]]'' (1943)\n*''[[This Is the Army]]'' (1943) (shown only in roadshow format on initial release)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/35613/warner-bros-and-the-homefront-collection/|title=Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection|website=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n*''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944)\n*''[[Spellbound (1945 film)|Spellbound]]'' (1945)\n*''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'' (1946) \n*''[[Mourning Becomes Electra (film)|Mourning Becomes Electra]]'' (1947)\n*[[Ingrid Bergman]]''<nowiki/>'''s ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]''  (1948)\n*''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (1949)\n*''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'' (1951).

The overture should not be confused with the main title music. The overture, recorded on film without a picture (and years later, on tape), was always played before the beginning of the film, while the lights were still up and the curtains were still closed.  As the lights dimmed, the overture ended, the curtains opened, and the film began with its main title music and opening credits. Likewise, the exit music should not be confused with the end title music. The exit music, also recorded without a picture on film, was always played ''after'' the end of the film, while the lights were up and the curtains were closed. As the lights came on, the end title music ended, the curtains closed, and the exit music began. Most movie theaters until the 1980s had curtains which covered the screen, and which would open when the show actually began and close when it ended.\n\n==Examples==\nAn early example of this was ''Gone with the Wind'' (1939). Running almost four hours in length, the film was divided into the above components, so that the film patron can experience the film as if they were seeing an actual play in a theater.\n\nThe original theatrical release of [[Walt Disney]]'s ''Fantasia'', presented in [[Fantasound]] in selected large cities in the United States, never had an overture, entr'acte, or exit music. Still, ''Fantasia'' was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience\u2014the printed souvenir program, given out to patrons as they entered the theater, presented the film's credits.\n\nThe original New York run of the English-language film ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1950 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' (1950), starring [[Jose Ferrer]] and based on [[Edmond Rostand]]'s 1897 French play, was likewise presented in a roadshow format (that is, one or two performances a day), although the film is only two hours long, was not produced on a large budget, and does not contain an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=Crowther |first=Bosley | authorlink= Bosley Crowther | url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&res=9506EFD61738E73ABC4F52DFB767838B649EDE  |title='Cyrano,' With Jose Ferrer in Title Role and Mala Powers as Roxane, Opens at the Bijou |publisher= The New York Times |date=1950-11-17 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Show Boat (1951 film)|1951 ''Show Boat'']] was also shown in a roadshow format in some theaters, despite being less than two hours long, and not having an overture, intermission, entr'acte, or exit music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcr2.htm|title=Widescreen Museum - Cinerama Wing 2|publisher=}}</ref> \n\n===1950s to 1970s===\nWith the rise of television, beginning in 1952 and continuing through the early 1970s, studios tried to bring movie audiences back to theaters by making widescreen epics, again using the \"roadshow\" formula.

Several of them, especially the musicals, were box-office flops that cost the studios fortunes, even if they had previously been hits as stage shows.\n\nSome of the films, such as the Olivier ''Othello'' or the Burton ''Hamlet'', were not even ''designed'' to be box-office smashes as films, but were merely meant to bring these productions to a wider public than could have seen them onstage, much as [[American Film Theatre]] would do in the mid-1970s.\n\nMany of these newer roadshow releases, including the Disney ''Sleeping Beauty'', were shown in six-track [[stereophonic sound]], a then non-standard feature of motion pictures. ''[[West Side Story (1961 film)|West Side Story]]'' (1961), although shown in 70mm and six track stereophonic sound, was shown with intermission with all 70MM prints as well as its re-releases, but was, in most areas, shown without one in order to increase the tension in the plot\u2014an idea recommended by the filmmakers themselves. The Special Limited Edition DVD release includes an option for watching the two-and-a-half hour film both with and without a break.\n\nSome films like ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' were often occasionally shown as roadshows for international releases, even if they weren't intended as roadshows for domestic release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/gunsofnavarone.php|title=DVD Verdict Review\u2014The Guns Of Navarone: Collector's Edition|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nIn 1961, ''[[The King and I (1956 film)|The King and I]]'', which had originally been shown in 35mm 4-Track stereophonic sound and without an overture, intermission and exit music, was re-released in a 70mm format with an overture, intermission and exit music, remixed into six-track stereophonic sound, and shown in a roadshow format. The film had originally been made in [[Cinemascope 55]] and through advances in technology was now able to be re-released in a process called [[70 mm Grandeur film|Grandeur 70]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.widescreenmuseum.com/widescreen/wingcs7.htm|title=Widescreen Museum\u2014The CinemaScope Wing 7\u2014CinemaScope 55|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFilms made in three-camera [[Cinerama]] always received roadshow releases to show off the technology. The special requirements needed to show films in Cinerama\u2014a theater with a huge, ultra-curved screen, three projectors running simultaneously, and seven-track stereophonic sound\u2014made it impossible to show its films in wide release unless the picture was converted to standard one projector format (i.e. [[Panavision]]).\n\nSince most of those cut off the sides of the original combined picture, eventually, with the advent of anamorphic lenses, a number of Cinerama roadshows were able to be compressed onto normal 5-perf 70MM film and with the extra-wide screens installed, normal 70MM theaters were able to play these reformatted Cinerama titles.\n\n==Exceptions==\nThere were some notable exceptions to the standard roadshow release format, three of them Shakespeare productions. One was ''Othello'' (1965), which was essentially a filmed visual record of the already famous Laurence Olivier 1964 London stage production, shot in a movie studio, but on enlarged stage settings. The nearly three-hour color film, made in Panavision and shown in 35MM and mono sound in many areas, was shown in 70MM and six-track stereophonic sound in exactly one engagement - in London in 1966,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |title=70mm Blow Up List 1966 - by |publisher=In70mm.com |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144618/http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1966.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nBeing a film that lay somewhere between a photographed play and a true motion picture, the film did not make sufficient use of the spectacular vistas that 1960s widescreen epics usually boasted. In addition, while it had no overture, entr'acte music, or exit music, it was still shown on a two-performance-a-day basis with an intermission, as nearly all roadshow releases were. However, it was shown in U.S. cinemas for an extremely limited release: only two days,<ref>{{cite news|last=Crowther |first=Bosley |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D07E0D6163AEF34BC4A53DFB466838D679EDE |title= Minstrel Show 'Othello':Radical Makeup Marks Olivier's Interpretation |publisher= The New York Times |date=1966-02-02 |accessdate=2011-09-23}}</ref> in contrast to the customary and lengthy months-long engagements enjoyed by most roadshow films.\n\nThe same was true of the Richard Burton ''Hamlet'', which was presented in the same type of extremely limited engagement as ''Othello''. Filmed over two days in a quickie black-and-white process called [[Electronovision]], which resembled a 1960s videotaped broadcast, this three hours plus production featured none of the epic features that were a standard of roadshow theatrical release - no impressive scenery, no gorgeous color, no beautiful costumes, or stereophonic sound, only an intermission halfway through the performance. It was not even, strictly speaking, a full-scale film version of the play, but merely a visual recording of a performance of it at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]], with a live audience. At three hours and eleven minutes, it was the longest film version of ''Hamlet'' to that date.\n\nAnother exception was Franco Zeffirelli's hugely successful 1968 version of ''Romeo and Juliet'', which, although photographed in beautiful settings and certainly having the look of an epic, was shown in most areas in monaural sound (although its three [[soundtrack album]]s were all made in stereo) and was projected at a screen aspect ratio of 1.66:1; that is, roughly the dimensions of today's average movie screen or HDTV screen, not the very wide screens required for films made in [[Ultra Panavision 70|Ultra Panavision]], CinemaScope, Todd-AO or any of the other ultrawide processes invented in the 1950s meant that the film lacked many of the customary roadshow elements opf the period. However The Mexican release of the picture, DID feature a six-track stereo surround mix and was shown with its original 1.66:1 aspect ratio matted to a 2.2 in standard 70MM.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |title=70mm films in Mexico |publisher=In70mm.com |date=2005-06-12 |accessdate=2011-09-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927144721/http://www.in70mm.com/news/2005/70mm_in/mexico/index.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the film version of [[James Goldman]]'s ''The Lion in Winter'' (1968), although a roadshow release filmed on location to qualify for the gorgeous color and beautiful scenery requirements, instead of being released in 70MM and 6-track stereo sound - even though it was shown in Technicolor, it was only from 35MM Panavision (anamorphic) film and mono sound. Only in Australia and in its 1973 London re-release was the picture shown in both 70MM and stereophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1968/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1968 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1973/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1973 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> 1971's ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', another roadshow release, was also shown in 70mm 6-track only in Europe, while its U.S. release was in regular Panavision with monophonic sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/technical|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067483/combined|title=Nicholas and Alexandra (1971)|work=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the above, ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (1959), ''Judgment at Nuremberg'' (1961) and ''The Longest Day'' (1962) were three epics that were shown in black and white instead of [[Technicolor]]. Before then, roadshow epics alternated between getting released in black and white or color.\n\n===Edited versions and restoration===\nIt was common practice for studios to cut some of these epics for general release in order for theaters to book more showings a day and present the film at reduced \"popular prices\", especially if the film ran longer than two hours. Sometimes this was done to a successful film, such as ''South Pacific'', but more often to one that had been a notable flop, in an effort to make it a success on its second run. As a result, some of these films have not been seen in their entirety since their first release, as the original edited footage is either missing or no longer exists. With the work of [[film preservation|film preservationists and restoration]], such roadshow flops as ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' (1935), ''Mourning Becomes Electra'' (1947), ''Joan of Arc'' (1948), '' A Star Is Born'' (1954) and ''Fantasia'' (1940), along with the hugely successful films ''For Whom the Bell Tolls'' (1943), ''Spartacus'', ''Lawrence of Arabia'', ''Around the World in 80 Days'' and ''It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'', all of which had significant footage missing, have been restored in recent years to match the filmmakers' original intent. However, several extremely popular long films, such as ''Gone With the Wind'' and ''The Ten Commandments'', have never been released in edited form, and were nearly always shown on a two performance-a-day basis.\n\n''In Old Chicago'', despite its roadshow presentation running only 110 minutes, was edited down to 95 minutes for general release, but restored to its full length on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/16907/in-old-chicago/|title=In Old Chicago|work=DVD Talk}}</ref>\n\nFrequently, unless the film was exceptionally long, the intermission, along with the overture, ent'racte music, and exit music would be eliminated when it went into general release, in order to save twenty minutes and possibly squeeze in more showings, and the film would be shown just like any other motion picture. Often too, the souvenir programs that were a part of the roadshow release of the films were no longer given out during the wide release.\n\n===Rise of the limited release===\nThe practice of roadshow presentation began dying out in the 1970s, partly due to a string of costly box-office flops, and partly due to the rise of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]]. As multiplexes began to increase in number, and as more and more skyscraper hotels and office buildings took the place of the oldtime movie palaces, theater exhibitors began showing long films in a more informal format. [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s Oscar-winning epics ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), for instance, were made with mono sound, shown without intermissions, and were given more than two performances a day, despite their extreme length. [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975) was shown more than twice a day, but included an intermission.\n\nAlthough some very long films such as ''Gone with the Wind'' would always be shown with an intermission and some films like ''[[Huckleberry Finn (1974 film)|Huckleberry Finn]]'' would be released with overtures until 1979, \"reserved seat\" showings of new films became extremely rare. The last film musical to officially receive a reserved seat engagement was ''[[Lost Horizon (1973 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1973), a financial and critical disaster.\n\nIn the late 1970s, only three films (two popular and one a legendary disaster) received a reserved seat engagement. Michael Cimino made the successful film ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'', which was a commercial and critical success, winning the Oscar for Best Picture. In its initial run, it was enlarged to 70mm film and given a roadshow release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1978/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1978 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> Francis Ford Coppola, director of ''[[The Godfather]]'', made ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', another three-hour epic which garnered some favorable reviews and is now considered one of his best. The film had a difficult production history, and after five years of production it premiered in a U.S. reserved seat engagement in 70mm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/library/blow_up/year/1979/index.htm|title=70mm Blow Up List 1979 - by in70mm.com|publisher=}}</ref> It became a great financial success, and made even more money years later when the director's cut was released. Cimino's next film in 1980 was ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which is infamous for being one of the biggest box office bombs ever. It had a roadshow release and premiered in a 70mm version with an intermission. The roadshow engagement was the shortest in history, for only three theaters held the screenings. Its New York run lasted three days, the Toronto run was shown once, and the Los Angeles engagement was cancelled.\n\nOne development that diminished the novelty of the modern roadshow release was that, beginning with ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), stereophonic sound began to be used more and more in films, even films that were not really big-budget spectaculars. Most films, however, were at that time still released only with mono sound. ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for example, made a mere two years before ''Star Wars'', was originally released in this format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/jaws.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Jaws|work=DVD Verdict}}</ref>\n\nAlthough as late as in 1982, the hugely successful ''[[Tootsie]]'' was also released with mono sound, as was the 1983 Best Picture winner ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084805/technical|title=Tootsie (1982)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086425/technical|title=Terms of Endearment (1983)|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref> By about 1984, mono sound was abandoned completely in American films, and stereo (often the six-track variety) finally became the norm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/combined|title=The Killing Fields (1984)|work=IMDb}}</ref>. However, 1982's ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' originally received 70mm releases with intermissions, due to their extreme lengths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083987/alternateversions|title=Gandhi (1982) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086250/alternateversions|title=Scarface (1983) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref>\n\nBy 1984, the entire roadshow format had also largely been abandoned, as the rise of the multiplex and competition from cable TV and home video began forcing changes in the nature of film industry. For example, ''[[Carmen (1984 film)|Carmen]]'' (1984), an uncut two-and-a-half hour film version of the popular [[Georges Bizet]] opera, was not released as a roadshow nor shown with an intermission, despite the fact that the film was so faithful to the opera that it kept the stage version's original division into four acts. The 1984 ''Carmen'' was also filmed in six-track stereo and on location, like many epics. \n\nEven though the format had died out, 1993's ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'', 1996's ''[[Hamlet (1996 film)|Hamlet]]'' and 2003's ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' were screened with intermissions due to their extreme lengths on their original releases. While all three films had no official overture, entr'acte or exit music, cinemas choose to show the films accompanied with the commercially available film soundtracks playing as the audience entered and exited theaters. ''Gettysburg'' and ''Hamlet'' were screened with two screenings a day while ''Gods and Generals'' was not.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/ae/20030222intermissionae1p1.asp|title=Intermission: The pause that refreshes Just like old days, long film has break|website=old.post-gazette.com}}</ref>\n\nToday, a practice of first premiering a film in larger cities is more common, mainly towards the end of the year, in order to qualify for film award consideration, including the [[Academy Awards]]. Such recent films that have gone the limited release route include ''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'' (2004), ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' (2005), and the Disney film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]'' (2009); these and other such limited release films eventually opened wide.  Sometimes this is done to allow a film to receive a wide release shortly after the first of the year, while qualifying for the previous year's Academy Awards. Often, smaller films (often art and independent) will receive an initial release in New York and Los Angeles, and later expand to other cities based on results; this is called \"platforming\" or a [[platform release]].\n\nOccasionally roadshow releases are done for special event films. In 2006, the film ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', based on the [[Dreamgirls (musical)|Broadway stage musical]], was given a three-theater road show release, with reserved seats and program guides. Tickets were significantly higher priced than normal, at $25. The film itself was not shown with an intermission.<ref>{{cite news| last=McClintock | first=Pamela | date=2006-11-06  | url= https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117953449.html | title= D'Works takes 'Girls' on road | publisher= Daily Variety | accessdate= 2006-11-06 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, the four-hour biopic ''[[Che (2008 film)|Che]]'', starring [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Che Guevara]], was shown in a roadshow format for a limited time in a number of large cities.\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]], who remembers the roadshow era fondly, released ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' in selected theaters on [[Christmas Day]] before expanding into a wide release on December 30, 2015. Tarantino shot the film in anamorphic 70mm (specifically the single-strip 6-track stereo [[Cinerama]] format described above) and managed to get the film booked in roughly 100 theaters worldwide that were provided 70mm projectors and lenses to equip the theaters to cope with the Cinerama format by [[The Weinstein Company]] to screen the film as the director intended.
