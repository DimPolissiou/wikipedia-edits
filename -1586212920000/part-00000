Widney]], who helped secure donations from several key figures in early Los Angeles history: a Protestant nurseryman, [[Ozro Childs]], an [[Irish Catholic]] former-Governor, [[John Gately Downey]], and a German Jewish banker, [[Isaias W. Hellman]]. The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that \"no student would be denied admission because of race\". The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952.\n\nWhen USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president. The school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. The city lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones, and a reliable fire alarm system. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three\u2014two males and female [[valedictorian]] Minnie C. Miltimore.\n\nThe colors of USC are cardinal and gold, which were approved by USC's third president, the Reverend [[George W. White (educator)|George W. White]], in 1896. In 1958, the shade of gold, which was originally more of an orange color, was changed to a more yellow shade. The letterman's awards were the first to make the change.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Tommytrojan2007.jpg|left|thumb|\"[[Tommy Trojan]]\" is a major symbol of the university, though he is not the mascot.]]\nUSC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the [[Trojan Shrine]], nicknamed \"Tommy Trojan\", near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. During a fateful track and field meet with [[Stanford University]], the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it seemed implausible USC would ever win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' sportswriter Owen Bird reported the USC athletes \"fought on like the [[Trojan War|Trojans]] of antiquity\", and the president of the university at the time, [[George F. Bovard]], approved the name officially.\n\nDuring World War II, USC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"usc-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-62/bio.pdf |title=Alfred S.

Known for its conferences, speakers series, training programs, publications and documentaries, USCI works to inform public discussion with policy-relevant research and timely programming. It publishes ''[https://uschinatoday.org/ US-China Today]'' and is widely known for its twelve-part ''Assignment:China'' documentary series on how China has been covered by American journalists since the 1940s. In 2010, the U.S. government and the USA Pavilion organizers asked USCI to manage the recruitment, selection, training and supervision of the students selected to staff the pavilion at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo]].\n\nOn May 1, 2014, USC was named as one of many higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights for potential [[Title IX]] violations by [[Barack Obama]]'s [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i |title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> USC is also under a concurrent Title IX investigation for potential anti-male bias in disciplinary proceedings, as well as denial of counseling resources to male students, {{as of|2016|March|8|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3116107-University-of-Southern-California-09-16-2128.html |title=U.S. Department of Education Opens Investigation Against the University of Southern California for Anti-Male Bias|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the university came into the national spotlight when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published information about [[Carmen A.

The reports span from 1990 to 2016 and include using racist and sexual language, conducting exams without gloves and taking pictures of his patients' genitals.

The campus's boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through campus vehicle traffic has been either severely restricted or entirely prohibited on some thoroughfares. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the [[Shrine Auditorium]], and [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] which is operated and managed by the University. Most buildings are in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] styles (especially two large [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] dormitories at the campus's northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built-in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]]s and gardens. The historic portion of the main campus was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.\n\n[[File:Zumberge Hall of Science.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zumberge Hall of Science|Zumberge Hall]], one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus]]\nBesides its main campus at University Park, USC also operates the Health Sciences Campus about {{convert|2|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the [[Keck School of Medicine]] and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] center in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] for business, pharmacy, social work and education; and the [[Information Sciences Institute]], with centers in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]] and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]].

A Health Sciences [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] campus holds The Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.\n\nUSC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart. The first was prepared by [[the Parkinsons]] in 1920, which guided much of the campus's early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.\n\n[[File:052607-013-VKC-USC.jpg|thumb|The Von KleinSmid Center of International and Public Affairs, topped by a {{convert|5500|lb|abbr=on}} globe, is the tallest structure on campus.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chantal |last=Garcia |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |title=VKC: A president's legacy |work=Daily Trojan |date=September 15, 2004 |access-date=May 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802034438/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |archive-date=August 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Built under the second master plan, reflected a trend towards modernism.]]\n\nThe second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President [[Norman Topping]], campus development director [[Anthony Lazzaro (university administrator)|Anthony Lazzaro]], and architect [[William Pereira]]. This plan annexed a great deal of the surrounding city and many of the older non-university structures within the new boundaries were leveled. Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s. Pereira maintained a predominantly red-brick architecture for the new buildings but infused them with his trademark techno-modernism stylings. More recently under President [[C. L. Max Nikias]], the architectural orientation of the campus has moved towards a Gothic Revival style, taking cues from the inculative{{typo help inline|reason=similar to insulative|date=November 2019}} and scholastic styles of [[Oxford University]] and [[Harvard University]], while underpinning USC's own historic identity that is present in the red-brick construction.\n\nUSC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the ''Time/Princeton Review College Guide''.\n\nRoughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in [[South Los Angeles]] amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], are credited for the safety of the university during the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several [[strip mall]]s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.) The [[ZIP code]] for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.\n\n[[File:USCLeavey2007.jpg|thumb|The Leavey Library, completed in the mid-1990s, reflected a shift to designs closer to earlier, Romanesque architecture.]]\n\n[[File:Traveler horse statue.webm|thumb|Video of Traveler horse statue at University of Southern California in Los Angeles]]\n\nUSC has an endowment of $5.7 billion and carries out about $764 million per year in sponsored research.<ref name=\"About USC\"/> USC became the only university to receive eight separate nine-figure gifts:{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} $120 million from Ambassador [[Walter Annenberg]] to create the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] and a later additional gift of $100 million for the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication]]; $112.5 million from [[Alfred E.

USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the internationally acclaimed [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]]. The health sciences campus is also home to the [[USC School of Pharmacy]] and several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, [[Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute]], Harlyne J.

USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906, the school was reopened by the municipal and regional government and thus officially separated from USC.

In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which is divided by residence hall.

Recently, a rivalry has begun to exist between USC and the University of Oregon because of the two universities' dominant football programs, with each school often serving as the toughest match-up on the opponent's schedule.\n\n===Mascots===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2020}}\nTraveler, a white [[Andalusian horse]], is the university's official mascot. It first appeared at a football game in 1961, was ridden by Richard Saukko, and was known as Traveler I. The current horse is known as Traveler VII.\n\n[[Tommy Trojan]], officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a Trojan warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players, and the statue is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.\n\nIn the 1940s, [[George Tirebiter]], a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. It gained fame among students after it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins, and was kept by the Trojan Knights. The dog was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, three others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.\n\n===Marching band===\n[[File:2008-0830-USC-UVA-TMB-drummajor.jpg|thumb|The drum major of the Spirit of Troy wears a more elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword.]]\n\nUSC's [[marching band]], known as [[Spirit of Troy|The Spirit of Troy]], has been featured in at least 10 major [[Film|movie]]s, and has performed in both the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ashley | last=Christensen | url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/08/18/OnCampusLife/Not-Your.Average.Marching.Band-702376.shtml | title=Not your average marching band | work=Daily Trojan | date=2004-08-18 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828132113/https://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/08/18/OnCampusLife/Not-Your.Average.Marching.Band-702376.shtml | archivedate=2007-08-28 }}</ref>  They have also performed on television shows and with other musicians.\n\nThe band performed on the title track of the [[1979 in music|1979]] [[Fleetwood Mac]] album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', which went on to be a [[platinum record|multi-platinum record]].

It secured the first interview of President [[Richard Nixon]] after his resignation. The publication does not receive financial aid from the university and instead runs entirely on advertisement revenue. Published from Monday to Friday during the fall and spring semesters, the newspaper turns into the Summer Trojan during the summer term and publishes once a week. It is the paper of record on campus.\n\nKXSC, previously known as KSCR, is the university's student-run [[college radio]] station, which is managed entirely by an unpaid staff of nearly 200 undergraduate and graduate student volunteers. The station gives students hands-on experience in a variety of music industry and broadcast-related positions, including live event promotion, social media management, radio production and [[audio engineering]]. In addition to providing almost 24 hours of daily live programming, the station also hosts live events, bringing local and touring bands to campus. The station's annual KXSC Fest, which began in 2009, has played host to performers such as [[Nosaj Thing]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kxsc.org/blog/2012/2/24/kxsc-fest-2012-nosaj-thing.html|title=KXSC FEST 2012: NOSAJ THING |publisher=KXSC}}</ref> [[Muna (band)]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEebuVO2c2I|title=MUNA - \"Promise\" - Live at KXSC Fest|publisher=KXSC|date=April 25, 2015}}</ref> [[Mika Miko]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.campuscircle.com/review.cfm?r=8363&h=KSCR-Fest-A-Grassroots-Gathering-March-Founder-s-Park-USC|title=KSCR Fest \u2013 A Grassroots Gathering: March 29 @ Founder's Park, USC |publisher=Campus Circle|date=April 9, 2009|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Dan Deacon]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://dailytrojan.com/2013/03/31/kxsc-fest-encourages-student-interaction/|title=KXSC Fest encourages student interaction|publisher=The Daily Trojan|date=March 31, 2013|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Thee Oh Sees]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/free-music-show-the-entrance-band-three-oh-sees-princeton-at-kscr-fest-2407346|title=Free Music Show!: The Entrance Band, Three Oh Sees, Princeton at KSCR Fest|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=March 25, 2010|access-date=April 6, 2019}}</ref> and [[Flying Lotus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kxsc.org/blog/2011/4/8/kxsc-fest-2011-flying-lotus.html|title=KXSC FEST 2011: FLYING LOTUS|publisher=KXSC}}</ref> KXSC traces its roots to the original [[KUSC]], which was operated by students starting in 1946. When KUSC transitioned to classical programming and moved off-campus in the mid-1970s, a group of students reacted to renewed demand for student-run radio station and founded KSCR in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kxsc.org/about|title=KXSC - About |publisher=KXSC}}</ref> KSCR was broadcast at 1560AM out of a student in the Hancock Foundation Building. In 1984, the University authorized a grant to move KSCR to a new location in Marks Hall. In 2010, KSCR adopted the call letters KXSC in order to be eligible to obtain a new FM license from the FCC, as well as to mark the station's move to a brand-new facility in the basement of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.\n\n''[[Trojan Vision]]'' (often abbreviated as ''TV8'') is the [[Student television station]] at USC. TV8 was established in 1997 by the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism|Annenberg School for Communication]], but is now a part of the School of Cinematic Arts. Trojan Vision broadcasts 24/7 from the Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts to the University Park Campus on Channel 8.1 and online through their website. Programming is also made available to the greater Los Angeles community on local channel LA36. In addition to a selection of regularly airing shows of many genres, Trojan Vision also broadcasts the shows ''Platforum'', a round-table debate show; ''[[Annenberg TV News]]'', a [[news program]]; and ''CU@USC'', an interview program.<ref>[http://trojanvision.com/?page_id=2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729173535/http://trojanvision.com/?page_id=2|date=July 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''El Rodeo'' is USC's student-run [[yearbook]]. One of the oldest student traditions at the university, the first edition was released in 1889 and was originally called ''The Sybil''. The name was changed to ''El Rodeo'' in 1899 to reflect the cowboy-themed events students threw to advertise the yearbook as a \"roundup\" of the year's events. It was long packaged with the Student Activity Card, which gave students access to all home sports games. Since the card was dissolved in 2007, the yearbook has been sold as a stand-alone item.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Hill |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/29/News/El.Rodeo.Yearbook.Fears.For.Its.Future.After.Cuts-2811940.shtml |title=El Rodeo yearbook fears for its future after cuts |work=Daily Trojan |date=March 29, 2007 |access-date=May 9, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802043546/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2007/03/29/News/El.Rodeo.Yearbook.Fears.For.Its.Future.After.Cuts-2811940.shtml |archive-date=August 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Greek life===\nThe [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek community]] has had a long history on the campus.

Widney]], who helped secure donations from several key figures in early Los Angeles history: a Protestant nurseryman, [[Ozro Childs]], an [[Irish Catholic]] former-Governor, [[John Gately Downey]], and a German Jewish banker, [[Isaias W. Hellman]]. The three donated 308 lots of land to establish the campus and provided the necessary seed money for the construction of the first buildings. Originally operated in affiliation with the Methodist Church, the school mandated from the start that \"no student would be denied admission because of race\". The university is no longer affiliated with any church, having severed formal ties in 1952.\n\nWhen USC opened in 1880, tuition was $15.00 per term and students were not allowed to leave town without the knowledge and consent of the university president. The school had an enrollment of 53 students and a faculty of 10. The city lacked paved streets, electric lights, telephones, and a reliable fire alarm system. Its first graduating class in 1884 was a class of three\u2014two males and female [[valedictorian]] Minnie C. Miltimore.\n\nThe colors of USC are cardinal and gold, which were approved by USC's third president, the Reverend [[George W. White (educator)|George W. White]], in 1896. In 1958, the shade of gold, which was originally more of an orange color, was changed to a more yellow shade. The letterman's awards were the first to make the change.{{Ref label|D|d|none}}\n\n[[File:Tommytrojan2007.jpg|left|thumb|\"[[Tommy Trojan]]\" is a major symbol of the university, though he is not the mascot.]]\nUSC students and athletes are known as Trojans, epitomized by the [[Trojan Shrine]], nicknamed \"Tommy Trojan\", near the center of campus. Until 1912, USC students (especially athletes) were known as Fighting Methodists or Wesleyans, though neither name was approved by the university. During a fateful track and field meet with [[Stanford University]], the USC team was beaten early and seemingly conclusively. After only the first few events, it seemed implausible USC would ever win; however, the team fought back, winning many of the later events, to lose only by a slight margin. After this contest, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' sportswriter Owen Bird reported the USC athletes \"fought on like the [[Trojan War|Trojans]] of antiquity\", and the president of the university at the time, [[George F. Bovard]], approved the name officially.\n\nDuring World War II, USC was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.<ref name=\"usc-v-12\">{{cite web |url=http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-62/bio.pdf |title=Alfred S.

Known for its conferences, speakers series, training programs, publications and documentaries, USCI works to inform public discussion with policy-relevant research and timely programming. It publishes ''[https://uschinatoday.org/ US-China Today]'' and is widely known for its twelve-part ''Assignment:China'' documentary series on how China has been covered by American journalists since the 1940s. In 2010, the U.S. government and the USA Pavilion organizers asked USCI to manage the recruitment, selection, training and supervision of the students selected to staff the pavilion at the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai Expo]].\n\nOn May 1, 2014, USC was named as one of many higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights for potential [[Title IX]] violations by [[Barack Obama]]'s [[White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i |title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref> USC is also under a concurrent Title IX investigation for potential anti-male bias in disciplinary proceedings, as well as denial of counseling resources to male students, {{as of|2016|March|8|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3116107-University-of-Southern-California-09-16-2128.html |title=U.S. Department of Education Opens Investigation Against the University of Southern California for Anti-Male Bias|publisher=|accessdate=10 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the university came into the national spotlight when the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published information about [[Carmen A.

After accusations of drug use, he resigned from his position as dean in 2016 and was fired from the school the following year after the news stories were published.

The reports span from 1990 to 2016 and include using racist and sexual language, conducting exams without gloves and taking pictures of his patients' genitals. [[Inside Higher Ed]] noted that there have been \"other incidents in which the university is perceived to have failed to act on misconduct by powerful officials<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/05/26/usc-president-will-step-down |title=USC President Will Step Down |first=Scott |last=Jaschick |website=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=May 26, 2018 |accessdate=May 27, 2018}}</ref>\" when it reported that the university's president, C. L. Max Nikias, is resigning. Tyndall was fired in 2017 after reaching a settlement with the university. The school did not report him to state medical authorities or law enforcement at the time, though the LAPD is now investigating Tyndall.

The campus's boundaries are Jefferson Boulevard on the north and northeast, Figueroa Street on the southeast, Exposition Boulevard on the south, and Vermont Avenue on the west. Since the 1960s, through campus vehicle traffic has been either severely restricted or entirely prohibited on some thoroughfares. The University Park campus is within walking distance to Los Angeles landmarks such as the [[Shrine Auditorium]], and [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] which is operated and managed by the University. Most buildings are in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] style, although some dormitories, engineering buildings, and physical sciences labs are of various [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] styles (especially two large [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] dormitories at the campus's northern edge) that sharply contrast with the predominantly red-brick campus. Widney Alumni House, built-in 1880, is the oldest university building in Southern California. In recent years the campus has been renovated to remove the vestiges of old roads and replace them with traditional university [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quad]]s and gardens. The historic portion of the main campus was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.\n\n[[File:Zumberge Hall of Science.jpg|left|thumb|[[Zumberge Hall of Science|Zumberge Hall]], one of the original buildings on the University Park Campus]]\nBesides its main campus at University Park, USC also operates the Health Sciences Campus about {{convert|2|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. In addition, the Children's Hospital Los Angeles is staffed by USC faculty from the [[Keck School of Medicine]] and is often referred to as USC's third campus. USC also operates an [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] center in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] for business, pharmacy, social work and education; and the [[Information Sciences Institute]], with centers in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]] and [[Marina del Rey, California|Marina del Rey]]. For its science students, USC operates the [[USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies|Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]] just {{convert|20|mi|km}} off the coast of Los Angeles and home to the [[Philip K. Wrigley]] Marine Science Center.\n\nThe Price School of Public Policy also runs a satellite campus in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. In 2005, USC established a federal relations office in Washington, D.C. A Health Sciences [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]] campus holds The Primary Care Physician Assistant Program, the Institute for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Research (IPR), and the Masters in Public Health Program.\n\nUSC was developed under two master plans drafted and implemented some 40 years apart. The first was prepared by [[the Parkinsons]] in 1920, which guided much of the campus's early construction and established its Romanesque style and 45-degree building orientation.\n\n[[File:052607-013-VKC-USC.jpg|thumb|The Von KleinSmid Center of International and Public Affairs, topped by a {{convert|5500|lb|abbr=on}} globe, is the tallest structure on campus.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chantal |last=Garcia |url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |title=VKC: A president's legacy |work=Daily Trojan |date=September 15, 2004 |access-date=May 29, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802034438/http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/09/15/Lifestyle/Vkc-A.Presidents.Legacy-719075.shtml |archive-date=August 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Built under the second master plan, reflected a trend towards modernism.]]\n\nThe second and largest master plan was prepared in 1961 under the supervision of President [[Norman Topping]], campus development director [[Anthony Lazzaro (university administrator)|Anthony Lazzaro]], and architect [[William Pereira]]. This plan annexed a great deal of the surrounding city and many of the older non-university structures within the new boundaries were leveled. Most of the Pereira buildings were constructed in the 1970s. Pereira maintained a predominantly red-brick architecture for the new buildings but infused them with his trademark techno-modernism stylings. More recently under President [[C. L. Max Nikias]], the architectural orientation of the campus has moved towards a Gothic Revival style, taking cues from the inculative{{typo help inline|reason=similar to insulative|date=November 2019}} and scholastic styles of [[Oxford University]] and [[Harvard University]], while underpinning USC's own historic identity that is present in the red-brick construction.\n\nUSC's role in making visible and sustained improvements in the neighborhoods surrounding both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses earned it the distinction of College of the Year 2000 by the ''Time/Princeton Review College Guide''.\n\nRoughly half of the university's students volunteer in community-service programs in neighborhoods around campus and throughout Los Angeles. These outreach programs, as well as previous administrations' commitment to remaining in [[South Los Angeles]] amid widespread calls to move the campus following the 1965 [[Watts Riots]], are credited for the safety of the university during the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]]. (That the university emerged from the riots completely unscathed is all the more remarkable in light of the complete destruction of several [[strip mall]]s in the area, including one just across Vermont Avenue from the campus's western security fence.) The [[ZIP code]] for USC is 90089 and the surrounding University Park community is 90007.\n\n[[File:USCLeavey2007.jpg|thumb|The Leavey Library, completed in the mid-1990s, reflected a shift to designs closer to earlier, Romanesque architecture.]]\n\n[[File:Traveler horse statue.webm|thumb|Video of Traveler horse statue at University of Southern California in Los Angeles]]\n\nUSC has an endowment of $5.7 billion and carries out about $764 million per year in sponsored research.<ref name=\"About USC\"/> USC became the only university to receive eight separate nine-figure gifts:{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} $120 million from Ambassador [[Walter Annenberg]] to create the [[Annenberg Center for Communication]] and a later additional gift of $100 million for the [[USC Annenberg School for Communication]]; $112.5 million from [[Alfred E.

USC faculty staffs these and many other hospitals in Southern California, including the internationally acclaimed [[Children's Hospital Los Angeles]]. The health sciences campus is also home to the [[USC School of Pharmacy]] and several research buildings such as USC/Norris Cancer Research Tower, Institute for Genetic Medicine, [[Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute]], Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower and Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research.\n\nThe Keck Hospital of USC is ranked No. 5 out of 411 hospitals in the State of California<ref>{{cite web|url=https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/ca |title=Best Hospitals in California}}</ref> and No. 16 in the nation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://health.usnews.com/health-care/best-hospitals/articles/best-hospitals-honor-roll-and-overview |title=U.S. News 2019-20 Best Hospitals Honor Roll}}</ref> by ''U.S. News & World Report.''\n\nIn July 2013, the University expanded its medical services into the foothill communities of northern Los Angeles when it acquired the 185 bed Verdugo Hills Hospital in [[Glendale, California]]. USC planned on making at least $30 million in capital improvements to the facility, which was officially renamed USC Verdugo Hills Hospital. This 40-year-old hospital provides the community a 24-hour emergency department, primary stroke center, maternity/labor and delivery, cardiac rehabilitation, and imaging and diagnostic services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.usc.edu/53163/usc-closes-deal-to-purchase-verdugo-hills-hospital/ |title=USC closes deal to purchase Verdugo Hills Hospital|date=2013-07-16}}</ref>\n\nUSC physicians serve more than one million patients each year.\n\n===Public transit===\nUSC is served by several rapid transit stations. The [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Metro Expo Line]] [[light rail]] service between [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and [[Santa Monica]] wraps around the south and eastern edges of the University Park campus.

USC ran the Chaffey College of Agriculture until financial troubles closed the school in 1901. In 1906, the school was reopened by the municipal and regional government and thus officially separated from USC. Renamed as Chaffey College, it now exists as a [[community college]] as part of the [[California Community College System]].\n\n==Organization and administration==\n[[File:USC-Bovard-1921.jpg|thumb|Bovard Hall, home of USC's central administration, shortly after completion in 1921; the streets later became pedestrian-only]]\n\nUSC is a private [[public-benefit nonprofit corporation]] controlled by a [[Board of Trustees]] composed of 50 voting members and several life trustees, honorary trustees, and trustees [[Emeritus|emeriti]] who do not vote. Voting members of the Board of Trustees are elected for five-year terms. One-fifth of the Trustees stand for re-election each year, and votes are cast only by the trustees not standing for election. Trustees tend to be high-ranking executives of large corporations (both domestic and international), successful alumni, members of the upper echelons of university administration, or some combination of the three.\n\nThe university administration consists of a president, a [[Provost (education)|provost]], several vice-presidents of various departments, a treasurer, a [[Chief Information Officer|chief information officer]], and an [[athletic director]].<ref name=\"Senior Administration of the University of Southern California\">{{cite web |url=https://about.usc.edu/administration/ |title= Senior Administration | publisher=USC | accessdate=2019-08-11}}</ref> The current president is [[Carol Folt]] who on July 1, 2019 succeeded Board of Trustee member [[Wanda Austin]] who had been appointed the interim president by the Board when the former president [[C.

It consists of a popularly elected president and vice president who lead an appointed executive cabinet, a popularly elected legislative branch, and judicial oversight. The executive cabinet oversees funding, communications, programming, and advocacy work. All USG activities are funded by the student activity fee. In addition to USG, residents within university housing are represented and governed by the Residential Housing Association (RHA), which is divided by residence hall. The Graduate Student Government (GSG) consists of senators elected by the students of each school proportional to its enrollment and its activities are funded by a graduate and professional student activity fee.\n\n===List of university presidents===\n#[[Marion M.

From at least 1972 to 1976, and likely for a number of years prior to 1972, it was called The School of Architecture and Fine Art. The School of Fine Art (known as SOFA for a number of years after Architecture and Fine Art separated) was eventually named the Roski School of Fine Arts in 2006 during a ceremony to open the then-new Masters of Fine Art building, which occupies the previous and completely refurbished Lucky Blue Jean factory. This small department grew rapidly with the help of the Allied Architects of Los Angeles. A separate School of Architecture was organized in September 1925. The school has been home to teachers such as [[Richard Neutra]], Ralph Knowles, James Steele, [[A. Quincy Jones]], [[William Pereira]] and [[Pierre Koenig]].

The victor of the annual football game takes home the [[Victory Bell (USC-UCLA)|Victory Bell]].  The Trojans and Bruins also compete in a year-long all-sports competition for the [[Lexus Gauntlet Trophy]]. Pranks between [[UCLA]] and USC were commonplace several decades ago.

Bonfire, and all-night vigils by the [[USC Helenes]] and [[Trojan Knights]] to protect the campus from [[UCLA Bruins]].\n\nIn addition, USC has rivalries with other Pac-12 schools, particularly the [[Stanford Cardinal]] as they are the only two private universities in the Pac-12 Conference and are situated at opposing regions of California, as well as being the two oldest private research universities in California, 1880 and 1891 respectively. Recently, a rivalry has begun to exist between USC and the University of Oregon because of the two universities' dominant football programs, with each school often serving as the toughest match-up on the opponent's schedule.\n\n===Mascots===\n{{uncited section|date=March 2020}}\nTraveler, a white [[Andalusian horse]], is the university's official mascot. It first appeared at a football game in 1961, was ridden by Richard Saukko, and was known as Traveler I. The current horse is known as Traveler VII.\n\n[[Tommy Trojan]], officially known as the Trojan Shrine, is a bronze statue in the model of a Trojan warrior at the center of campus. It is commonly mistaken as the school's official mascot. The statue was modeled after Trojan football players, and the statue is engraved with the ideal characteristics of a Trojan. It is a popular meeting point for students and a landmark for visitors.\n\nIn the 1940s, [[George Tirebiter]], a car-chasing dog, was the most popular unofficial mascot. It gained fame among students after it bit the mascot of the UCLA Bruins, and was kept by the Trojan Knights. The dog was known to chase down cars on Trousdale Parkway, which runs through campus. After the original dog died, three others succeeded it. A statue was built in 2006 to honor the unofficial mascot.\n\n===Marching band===\n[[File:2008-0830-USC-UVA-TMB-drummajor.jpg|thumb|The drum major of the Spirit of Troy wears a more elaborate uniform and conducts the band with a sword.]]\n\nUSC's [[marching band]], known as [[Spirit of Troy|The Spirit of Troy]], has been featured in at least 10 major [[Film|movie]]s, and has performed in both the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news | first=Ashley | last=Christensen | url=http://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/08/18/OnCampusLife/Not-Your.Average.Marching.Band-702376.shtml | title=Not your average marching band | work=Daily Trojan | date=2004-08-18 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828132113/https://media.www.dailytrojan.com/media/storage/paper679/news/2004/08/18/OnCampusLife/Not-Your.Average.Marching.Band-702376.shtml | archivedate=2007-08-28 }}</ref>  They have also performed on television shows and with other musicians.\n\nThe band performed on the title track of the [[1979 in music|1979]] [[Fleetwood Mac]] album ''[[Tusk (album)|Tusk]]'', which went on to be a [[platinum record|multi-platinum record]].

For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&nbsp;\u2013 NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].\n\n===Quantum dot preparation===\nSurfactants are used with [[quantum dot]]s in order to manipulate growth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Monodisperse Nanocrystals and Close-Packed Nanocrystal Assemblies |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=545\u2013610 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.545|bibcode = 2000AnRMS..30..545M |last1=Murray |first1=C.

For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network.

He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979. The United Kingdom [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrew from the European Union]] under the terms of a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. Johnson tested positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in March 2020, and on 6 April, he was admitted to intensive care.<!--Please be careful when updating the above, only update with very significant updates. Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language.

June 1964) is a British politician, writer, and former journalist serving as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] since 2019. He was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 2016 to 2018 and [[Mayor of London]] from [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] to 2016. Johnson was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]] to [[2008 Henley by-election|2008]] and has been MP for [[Uxbridge and South Ruislip (UK Parliament constituency)|Uxbridge and South Ruislip]] since [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]]. Ideologically, Johnson identifies as a [[one-nation conservative]].\n\n<!--Early life, journalism, and early political career-->\nJohnson was born in New York City to upper-middle-class [[English people|English]] parents and educated at [[Eton College]]. He read [[Literae Humaniores|Classics]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], where he was elected [[President of the Oxford Union]] in 1986. He began his career in journalism at ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, from which he was dismissed for falsifying a quotation. He later became the Brussels correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper, where his articles exerted a strong influence on growing [[Eurosceptic]] sentiment on the British right. He was promoted to be an assistant editor from 1994 to 1999, and edited ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine from 1999 to 2005.\n\nHe was elected MP for Henley in 2001, and served as a [[Shadow Cabinet|Junior Shadow Minister]] under Conservative leaders [[Michael Howard]] and [[David Cameron]]. He largely adhered to the Conservatives' [[party line (politics)|party line]] but adopted a [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] stance on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom|LGBT rights]] in parliamentary votes. He [[resigned from the British House of Commons|resigned as an MP]] and in [[2008 London mayoral election|2008]] was elected Mayor of London, being re-elected in [[2012 London mayoral election|2012]]. During his mayoralty he oversaw the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], introduced the [[New Routemaster]] buses, a [[Santander Cycles|cycle hire scheme]] and a [[Emirates Air Line (cable car)|cable car crossing the Thames]], and banned alcohol consumption on much of London's public transport.\n\n<!--Post-Mayoral career-->\nIn 2015, Johnson was [[2015 United Kingdom general election|elected]] MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, stepping down as mayor the following year. In 2016, he became a prominent figure in the successful [[Vote Leave]] campaign for [[Brexit]]. He then served as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] during the earlier stages of [[Theresa May]]'s premiership; [[List of departures from the second May ministry|he resigned from the post]] two years later, in criticism of May's approach to Brexit and the [[Chequers Agreement]]. After May resigned in 2019, he was [[2019 Conservative Party leadership election|elected]] Conservative leader and appointed prime minister. His [[2019 British prorogation controversy|September 2019 prorogation of]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] was ruled unlawful by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"prorogationtechnicality\">Formally, Parliament is prorogued by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister; it is a common [[legal fiction]] in the UK that many executive functions of the Prime Minister are formally carried out by the Queen on the Prime Minister's \"advice\", which is effectively the legal instrument by which the Prime Minister carries out the function. It was this advice of Johnson's that was ruled unlawful, not the actions of Her Majesty.</ref> In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Johnson led the Conservative Party to its biggest victory since 1987, with the biggest percentage vote share of any party since 1979. The United Kingdom [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrew from the European Union]] under the terms of a revised [[Brexit withdrawal agreement]]. Johnson has tested positive for [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in March 2020, and on 6 April, he was admitted to intensive care.<!--Please be careful when updating the above, only update with very significant updates. Avoid WP:RECENTISM-->\n\n<!--Reception, legacy, and influence-->\nJohnson is a controversial figure in British politics and journalism. Supporters have praised him as an entertaining, humorous, and popular figure, with an appeal stretching beyond traditional Conservative voters and [[Eurosceptics]]. Conversely, his critics have accused him of dishonesty, [[elitism]], and [[cronyism]], and of using offensive language. Johnson is the subject of several biographies and fictionalised portrayals.<!-- DO NOT REMOVE THIS LONGSTANDING PARAGRAPH WITHOUT DISCUSSING ON TALK PAGE; THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS IS FULLY SOURCED IN ARTICLE BODY. -->\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood: 1964\u20131977===\nJohnson was born on 19 June 1964 in the [[Upper East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/07/23/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-boris-johnson.html |title=Boris Johnson's Chaotic Path to Power Finally Pays Off |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=23 July 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=31 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190731124042/https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/07/23/world/europe/ap-eu-britain-boris-johnson.html |archive-date=31 July 2019}}</ref>{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=10|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=1}} to 23 year-old [[Stanley Johnson (writer)|Stanley Johnson]], an Englishman, then studying economics at [[Columbia University]],{{sfnm|1a1=Purnell|1y=2011|1p=11|2a1=Gimson|2y=2012|2p=2}} and his 22-year-old wife of one year [[Charlotte Johnson Wahl|Charlotte Fawcett]],<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news |last=Llewellyn Smith |first=Julia |date=18 May 2008 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/borisjohnson/1976150/Boris-Johnson-by-his-mother-Charlotte-Johnson-Wahl.html |title=Boris Johnson, by his mother Charlotte Johnson Wahl |work=The Sunday Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> an artist from a family of liberal intellectuals and a daughter of Sir [[James Fawcett (barrister)|James Fawcett]], a barrister.
