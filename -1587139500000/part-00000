The data collected by OLA will also be used to develop a control network relative to the center of mass of the asteroid and to enhance and refine gravitational studies of Bennu.\n\nOLA has a single common receiver and two complementary transmitter assemblies that enhance the resolution of the information brought back. OLA's high-energy laser transmitter is used for ranging and mapping from {{convert|1|to|7.5|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from {{convert|0.5|to|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable scanning mirror, which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag.\n\nOLA was funded by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA) and was built by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] at Brampton, Ontario, Canada.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/osiris-rex/ola.asp |title=OLA, Canada's Contribution to OSIRIS-REx |work=Canadian Space Agency |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> OLA was delivered for integration with the spacecraft on 17 November 2015.<ref>\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/canada-contributes-to-nasa-s-osiris-rex-mission |title=Canada Contributes to NASA's OSIRIS-REx Mission |publisher=NASA |first=Nancy N. |last=Jones |date=17 July 2014}}\n*{{cite news |url=https://www.kelownanow.com/news/news/National_News/15/12/17/Canada_to_Invest_in_Space_Exploration_with_New_Laser/ |title=Canada to Invest in Space Exploration with New Laser |work=Kelowna Now |first=Cassandra |last=Jeffery |date=17 December 2015}}</ref> The lead instrument scientist of OLA is Michael Daly from [[York University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/osiris-rex/canadas-role.asp|title=Canada's role in OSIRIS-REx|date=4 March 2013|website=www.asc-csa.gc.ca|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===OVIRS===\n[[File:Osiris-Rex Ovirs gsfc 20150619 2015-12655 019-023.jpg|thumb|OVIRS]]\nThe OSIRIS-REx Visible and IR Spectrometer (OVIRS) is a [[spectrometer]], which measures light to provide mineral and organic spectral maps and local spectral information of candidate sample sites.<ref name=\"instruments\" /> It also provides full-disc asteroid spectral data, global spectral maps (20&nbsp;m resolution), and spectra of the sample site (blue to near-infrared, {{nowrap|400\u20134,300 nm}}, with a [[spectral resolution]] of {{nowrap|7.5\u201322 nm}}).<ref name=\"simonmiller2013\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf/1100.pdf |title=OSIRIS-REx OVIRS: A Scalable Visible to Near-IR Spectrometer for Planetary Study |conference=44th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 18\u201322 March 2013.

The [[wavelength]] range, spectral resolution, and radiometric performance are sufficient to resolve and identify the key vibrational absorption features of silicate, carbonate, sulfate, phosphate, oxide, and hydroxide minerals. OTES is also used to measure the total thermal emission from Bennu in support of the requirement to measure emitted radiation globally. Based on the performance of [[Mini-TES]] in the dusty surface environment of Mars, OTES was designed to be resilient to extreme dust contamination on the optical elements.\n\n===REXIS===\nThe Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) will provide an [[X-ray spectroscopy]] map of Bennu to constrain the element abundances. It complements core OSIRIS-REx mission science.<ref name=\"instruments\" /> REXIS is a collaborative development by four groups within [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[Harvard University]], with the potential to involve more than 100 students throughout the process. REXIS is based on flight heritage hardware, thereby minimizing elements of technical risk, schedule risk, and cost risk.\n\nREXIS is a [[coded aperture]] soft X-ray (0.3\u20137.5&nbsp;keV) telescope that images X-ray fluorescence line emission produced by the interaction of solar [[X-rays]] and the [[solar wind]] with the regolith of Bennu. Images are formed with 21 [[Minute of arc|arcminute]] resolution (4.3&nbsp;m spatial resolution at a distance of 700&nbsp;m). Imaging is achieved by correlating the detected X-ray image with a 64 x 64 element random mask (1.536&nbsp;mm pixels). REXIS will store each X-ray event data in order to maximize the data storage usage and to minimize the risk. The [[pixel]]s will be addressed in 64 x 64 bins and the 0.3\u20137.5&nbsp;keV range will be covered by five broad bands and 11 narrow line bands. A 24&nbsp;s resolution time tag will be interleaved with the event data to account for Bennu rotation. Images will be reconstructed on the ground after downlink of the event list. Images are formed simultaneously in 16 energy bands centered on the dominant lines of abundant surface elements from O-K (0.5&nbsp;keV) to Fe-K\u00df (7&nbsp;keV) as well the representative continuum. During orbital phase 5B, a 21-day orbit 700&nbsp;m from the surface of Bennu, a total of at least 133 events/asteroid pixel/energy band are expected under 2&nbsp;keV; enough to obtain significant constraints on element abundances at scales larger than 10&nbsp;m.\n\nOn 11 November 2019, university students and researchers involved in the mission accidentally discovered X-ray burst from a [[black hole]] name MAXI J0637-430 locate 30,000 light-years away, during observing the asteroid with REXIS.<ref>{{cite web| title = OSIRIS-REx Observes a Black Hole\n | date = 3 March 2020| publisher = NASA Goddard | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erry315AwmI | access-date = 5 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===TAGSAM===\n[[File:Osiris-Rex Sample-return-arm-test-167.jpg|thumb|TAGSAM arm test before launch]]\n{{main|TAGSAM}}\nThe sample-return system, called Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), consists of a sampler head with an articulated {{convert|3.35|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} arm.<ref name=\"press kit\" /><ref name=\"instruments\" /> An on-board nitrogen source will support up to three separate sampling attempts for a minimum total amount of {{convert|60|g}} of sample.

The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from {{convert|0.5|to|1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}. The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable scanning mirror, which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag.\n\nOLA was funded by the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA) and was built by [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] at Brampton, Ontario, Canada.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/osiris-rex/ola.asp |title=OLA, Canada's Contribution to OSIRIS-REx |work=Canadian Space Agency |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref> OLA was delivered for integration with the spacecraft on 17 November 2015.<ref>\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/canada-contributes-to-nasa-s-osiris-rex-mission |title=Canada Contributes to NASA's OSIRIS-REx Mission |publisher=NASA |first=Nancy N. |last=Jones |date=17 July 2014}}\n*{{cite news |url=https://www.kelownanow.com/news/news/National_News/15/12/17/Canada_to_Invest_in_Space_Exploration_with_New_Laser/ |title=Canada to Invest in Space Exploration with New Laser |work=Kelowna Now |first=Cassandra |last=Jeffery |date=17 December 2015}}</ref> The lead instrument scientist of OLA is Michael Daly from [[York University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/osiris-rex/canadas-role.asp|title=Canada's role in OSIRIS-REx|date=4 March 2013|website=www.asc-csa.gc.ca|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n\n===OVIRS===\n[[File:Osiris-Rex Ovirs gsfc 20150619 2015-12655 019-023.jpg|thumb|OVIRS]]\nThe OSIRIS-REx Visible and IR Spectrometer (OVIRS) is a [[spectrometer]], which measures light to provide mineral and organic spectral maps and local spectral information of candidate sample sites.<ref name=\"instruments\" /> It also provides full-disc asteroid spectral data, global spectral maps (20&nbsp;m resolution), and spectra of the sample site (blue to near-infrared, {{nowrap|400\u20134,300 nm}}, with a [[spectral resolution]] of {{nowrap|7.5\u201322 nm}}).<ref name=\"simonmiller2013\">{{cite conference |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2013/pdf/1100.pdf |title=OSIRIS-REx OVIRS: A Scalable Visible to Near-IR Spectrometer for Planetary Study |conference=44th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 18\u201322 March 2013.

OTES is also used to measure the total thermal emission from Bennu in support of the requirement to measure emitted radiation globally. Based on the performance of [[Mini-TES]] in the dusty surface environment of Mars, OTES was designed to be resilient to extreme dust contamination on the optical elements.\n\n===REXIS===\nThe Regolith X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (REXIS) will provide an [[X-ray spectroscopy]] map of Bennu to constrain the element abundances. It complements core OSIRIS-REx mission science.<ref name=\"instruments\" /> REXIS is a collaborative development by four groups within [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[Harvard University]], with the potential to involve more than 100 students throughout the process. REXIS is based on flight heritage hardware, thereby minimizing elements of technical risk, schedule risk, and cost risk.\n\nREXIS is a [[coded aperture]] soft X-ray (0.3\u20137.5&nbsp;keV) telescope that images X-ray fluorescence line emission produced by the interaction of solar [[X-rays]] and the [[solar wind]] with the regolith of Bennu. Images are formed with 21 [[Minute of arc|arcminute]] resolution (4.3&nbsp;m spatial resolution at a distance of 700&nbsp;m). Imaging is achieved by correlating the detected X-ray image with a 64 x 64 element random mask (1.536&nbsp;mm pixels). REXIS will store each X-ray event data in order to maximize the data storage usage and to minimize the risk. The [[pixel]]s will be addressed in 64 x 64 bins and the 0.3\u20137.5&nbsp;keV range will be covered by five broad bands and 11 narrow line bands. A 24&nbsp;s resolution time tag will be interleaved with the event data to account for Bennu rotation. Images will be reconstructed on the ground after downlink of the event list. Images are formed simultaneously in 16 energy bands centered on the dominant lines of abundant surface elements from O-K (0.5&nbsp;keV) to Fe-K\u00df (7&nbsp;keV) as well the representative continuum. During orbital phase 5B, a 21-day orbit 700&nbsp;m from the surface of Bennu, a total of at least 133 events/asteroid pixel/energy band are expected under 2&nbsp;keV; enough to obtain significant constraints on element abundances at scales larger than 10&nbsp;m.\n\nOn 11 November 2019, university students and researchers involved in the mission accidentally discovered X-ray burst from a [[black hole]] name MAXI J0637-430 locate 30,000 light-years away, during observing the asteroid with REXIS.<ref>{{cite web| title = OSIRIS-REx Observes a Black Hole\n | date = 3 March 2020| publisher = NASA Goddard | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erry315AwmI | access-date = 5 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===TAGSAM===\n[[File:Osiris-Rex Sample-return-arm-test-167.jpg|thumb|TAGSAM arm test before launch]]\n{{main|TAGSAM}}\nThe sample-return system, called Touch-And-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism (TAGSAM), consists of a sampler head with an articulated {{convert|3.35|m|ft|0|adj=on|sp=us}} arm.<ref name=\"press kit\" /><ref name=\"instruments\" /> An on-board nitrogen source will support up to three separate sampling attempts for a minimum total amount of {{convert|60|g}} of sample.

Settlers had to depend on what they could hunt and gather, what they brought with them, and uncertain shipments of food, tools, and supplies until they could build shelters and forts, clear land, and grow enough food, as well as build gristmills, sawmills, ironworks, and blacksmith shops to be self-supporting. They also had to defend themselves against raids from hostile Indians. After 1629 population growth was very rapid due to high birth rates (8 children per family versus 4 in Europe) and lower death rates than in Europe, in addition to immigration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=1}}</ref> The long life expectancy of the colonists was due to the abundant supplies of food and firewood and the low population density that limited the spread of infectious diseases. The death rate from diseases, especially malaria, was higher in the warm, humid southern colonies than in cold New England.\n\nThe higher birth rate was due to better employment opportunities. Many young adults in Europe delayed marriage for financial reasons, and there were many servants in Europe who were not permitted to marry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=1\u20135}}</ref>\nThe population of white settlers grew from an estimated 40,000 in 1650 to 235,000 in 1700. In 1690, there were an estimated 13,000 black slaves. The population grew at an annual rate of over 3% throughout the 18th century, doubling every 25 years or less.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=x}}</ref> By 1775 the population had grown to 2.6 million, of which 2.1 million were white, 540,000 black and 50,000 Native American, giving the colonies about one-third of the population of Britain. The three most populated colonies in 1775 were Virginia, with a 21% share, and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts with 11% each.\n\n===The economy===\nThe colonial economy of what would become the United States was pre-industrial, primarily characterized by subsistence farming. Farm households also were engaged in handicraft production, mostly for home consumption, but with some goods sold.<ref name=\"Perkins 1988 pp\">{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[market economy]] was based on extracting and processing natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, [[gristmill]]s and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed feed grains (wheat, Indian corn, rice, bread and flour) and tobacco.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=31}}</ref> Tobacco was a major crop in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region and rice a major crop in [[South Carolina]]. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included [[turpentine]] (used for lamps), rosin (candles and soap), [[tar]] (rope and wood preservative) and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] (ships' hulls). Another export was [[potash]], which was derived from hardwood ashes and was used as a [[fertilizer]] and for making soap and glass.\n\nThe colonies depended on Britain for many finished goods, partly because laws prohibited making many types of finished goods in the colonies. These laws achieved the intended purpose of creating a trade surplus for Britain. The colonial balance trade in goods was heavily in favor of Britain; however, American shippers were able to offset roughly half of the goods trade deficit with revenues earned by shipping between ports within the British Empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=24, 28}}</ref>\n\nThe largest non-agricultural segment was ship building, which was from 5 to 20% of total employment.<ref>\n{{cite book |title      = A New Economic View of American History\n |last1      = Atack\n |first1     =fake stuiuuud\n |last2      = Passell\n |first2     = Peter\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 1994\n |publisher  = W.W.

Except for slaves, [[standards of living]] were generally high\u2014higher, in fact, than in England itself.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds., ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) chapter 7</ref>\n\n====New England====\nThe [[History of New England|New England]] region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the provinces and many towns as well, tried to foster economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns and ferries. They gave bounties and subsidies or monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, [[iron mill]]s, pulling mills (which treated cloth), salt works and glassworks. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region, as the Puritans and Yankees endorsed the \"[[Protestant Work Ethic|Protestant Ethic]]\", which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.<ref>Margaret Alan Newell, \"The Birth of New England in the Atlantic Economy: From its Beginning to 1770,\" in Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (Harvard UP, 2000), pp. 11\u201368, esp. p. 41</ref>\n\nThe benefits of growth were widely distributed in New England, reaching from merchants to farmers to hired laborers. The rapidly growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands farther west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775; new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring. The region bordered New France, and in the numerous wars the British poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay colonial soldiers. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade and shipbuilding\u2014and after 1780 in whaling. Combined with growing urban markets for farm products, these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T. Main, \"The Red Queen in New England?\", ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1999) 56#1 pp 121\u201350 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2674597 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe Connecticut economy began with subsistence farming in the 17th century, and developed with greater diversity and an increased focus on production for distant markets, especially the British colonies in the Caribbean. The American Revolution cut off imports from Britain, and stimulated a manufacturing sector that made heavy use of the entrepreneurship and mechanical skills of the people. In the second half of the 18th century, difficulties arose from the shortage of good farmland, periodic money problems, and downward price pressures in the export market. <ref>Bruce C.

He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. \nFurthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people in need.\n\nThe colonists were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure, and solve urban problems.<ref>Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625\u20131742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]</ref> They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid. Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as \"sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest,\" public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to \"democratic yearnings\" for political power.<ref>Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743\u20131776'' (1955), pp 147, 332</ref><ref>Benjamin L.

He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia to disseminate their ideology to the working class, and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.<ref>Gary B.

Colonies were used as suppliers of raw materials and as markets for manufactured goods while being prohibited from engaging in most types of manufacturing.<ref name=Stark_2005/>{{rp|214}}  The colonial powers of England, France, Spain and the Dutch Republic tried to protect their investments in colonial ventures by limiting trade between each other's colonies.\n\nSpain clung to old style mercantilism, primarily concerned with enriching the Spanish government by accumulating gold and silver, mainly from mines in their colonies. The Dutch and particularly the British approach was more conducive to private business.<ref>{{cite book|title= A Patriot's History of the United States|last1= Schweikart|first1= Larry|last2= Allen|first2= Michael|year= 2004|publisher= Sentinel, member of Penguin Group|location= USA|isbn= 978-1595230010|pages= [https://archive.org/details/patriotshistoryo00larr_0/page/12 12\u201317]|url= https://archive.org/details/patriotshistoryo00larr_0/page/12}}</ref>\n\nA mercantile policy that affected the British American colonies was the [[Navigation Acts]], which were passed by the British Parliament between 1651 and 1673.\n\nImportant features of the Navigation Acts are:\n* Foreign vessels were excluded from carrying trade between ports within the British Empire\n* Manufactured goods from Europe to the colonies had to pass through England\n* Enumerated items, which included furs, ship masts, rice, indigo and tobacco, were only allowed to be exported to Great Britain.\n\nAlthough the Navigation Acts were enforced, they had a negligible effect on commerce and profitability of trade. In 1770 illegal exports and smuggling to the West Indies and Europe were about equal to exports to Britain.<ref name=Stark_2005>{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|url= https://archive.org/details/victoryofreasonh00star|url-access= registration|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=978-0-8129-7233-7|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|216}}\n\nOn the eve of independence Britain was in the early stage of the [[Industrial Revolution]], with cottage industries and workshops providing finished goods for export to the colonies. At that time, half of the wrought iron, beaver hats, cordage, nails, linen, silk, and printed cotton produced in Britain were consumed by the British American colonies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=26}}</ref>\n\n====Free enterprise====\nThe domestic economy of the British American colonies enjoyed a great deal of freedom, although some of their freedom was due to lack of enforcement of British regulations on commerce and industry. [[Adam Smith]] used the colonies as an example of the benefits of free enterprise.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=13}}</ref> Colonists paid minimal taxes.\n\nSome colonies, such as Virginia, were founded principally as business ventures. England's success at colonizing what would become the United States was due in large part to its use of [[charter companies]]. Charter companies were groups of stockholders (usually merchants and wealthy landowners) who sought personal economic gain and, perhaps, wanted also to advance England's national goals. While the private sector financed the companies, the king also provided each project with a charter or grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial authority. The colonies did not show profits, however, and the disappointed English investors often turned over their colonial charters to the settlers. The political implications, although not realized at the time, were enormous. The colonists were left to build their own governments and their own economy.\n\n====Taxation====\nThe colonial governments had few expenses and taxes were minimal.\n\nAlthough the colonies provided an export market for finished goods made in Britain or sourced by British merchants and shipped from Britain, the British incurred the expenses of providing protection against piracy by the British Navy and other military expenses. An early tax was the [[Molasses Act]] of 1733.\n\nIn the 1760s the London government raised small sums by new taxes on the colonies. This occasioned an enormous uproar, from which historians date the origins of the American Revolution. The issue was not the amount of the taxes\u2014they were quite small\u2014but rather the constitutional authority of Parliament versus the colonial assemblies to vote taxes.<ref>Edmund Morgan, and Helen M.

The British tried to crush the American economy with a blockade of all ports, but with 90% of the people in farming, and only 10% in cities, the American economy proved resilient and able to support a sustained war, which lasted from 1775 to 1783.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds., ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) chapters 42, 48</ref>\n\n[[File:A Picturesque View of the State of the Nation for February 1778 (caricature) RMG PU4786.jpg|thumb|Revolutionary era cartoon showing US sawing of the horn of a cow (symbolizing a break from British commerce) with a distressed Englishman watching as other European powers wait to collect milk.

Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962) pp 23\u201344</ref> In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover existing transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [[Bank of North America]] to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.<ref>Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225\u201352</ref>\n\nCongress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586\u2013589</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775\u20131780, and in 1780\u201381. The first issue amounted to 242&nbsp;million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was \"not worth a Continental\", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless\u2014but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200&nbsp;million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes\u2014but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, \"Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775\u20131783\", ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 35, No. 1 (Oct., 1929), pp. 46\u201368 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref> The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages\u2014usually in arrears\u2014declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.\n\nStarting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776\u20131790'' (1961)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities\u2014an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990)</ref>\n\nThe cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775\u201383. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy. Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776\u201383, and the others for briefer periods. During the occupations they were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. When the British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants who resumed their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.<ref>Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962)</ref>\n\n==The new nation==\n[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|350px|Chart 1: trends in economic growth, 1700\u20131850]]\n\nThe [[U.S. Constitution]], adopted in 1787, established that the entire nation was a unified, or common market, with no internal tariffs or taxes on interstate commerce. The extent of federal power was much debated, with [[Alexander Hamilton]] taking a very broad view as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] during the presidential administration of [[George Washington]]. Hamilton successfully argued for the concept of \"[[implied powers]]\", whereby the federal government was authorized by the Constitution to create anything necessary to support its contents, even if it not specifically noted in it (build lighthouses, etc.). He succeeded in building strong national credit based on taking over the state debts and bundling them with the old national debt into new securities sold to the wealthy. They in turn now had an interest in keeping the new government solvent. Hamilton funded the debt with tariffs on imported goods and a highly controversial tax on whiskey. Hamilton believed the United States should pursue economic growth through diversified shipping, manufacturing, and banking. He sought and achieved Congressional authority to create the [[First Bank of the United States]] in 1791; the charter lasted until 1811.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962)</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the older cities finally restored their economic basis; newer growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and Baltimore, and Maryland. The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.<ref>Robert A. East, \"The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763\u20131795,\" ''Journal of Economic History''\n (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16\u201327 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nWorld peace lasted only a decade, for in 1793 a two decades of war between Britain and France and their allies broke out. As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798\u201399 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807\u20131812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]].\n\n===Industry and commerce===\n====Transportation====\nThere were very few roads outside of cities and no canals in the new nation. In 1792 it was reported that the cost of transport of many crops to seaport was from one-fifth to one half their cost.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=34}}</ref> The cheapest form of transportation was by water, along the seacoast or on lakes and rivers.  In 1816 it was reported that \"A ton of goods could be brought 3000 miles from Europe for about $9, but for that same sum it could be moved only 30 miles in this country\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|year-1969}}</ref>{{rp|132}}\n\n====Automatic flour mill====\nIn the mid 1780s [[Oliver Evans]] invented a [[Oliver Evans#Developing the Automatic Flour Mill, 1783\u20131790|fully automatic mill]] that could process grain with practically no human labor or operator attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used bucket elevators and conveyor belts, which would eventually revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used [[centrifugal governor|governors]], a forerunner of modern automation, for control.\n\n====Cotton gin====\n[[File:Cotton gin harpers.jpg|thumb|\"The First Cotton Gin\" conjectural image from 1869]]\nCotton was at first a small-scale crop in the South.

Britain prohibited the export of textile machinery and designs and did not allow mechanics with such skills to emigrate.\n[[Samuel Slater]], who worked as mechanic at a cotton spinning operation in England, memorized the design of the machinery. He was able to disguise himself as a laborer and emigrated to the U.S., where he heard there was a demand for his knowledge. In 1789 Slater began working as a consultant to Almy & Brown in Rhode Island who were trying to successfully spin cotton on some equipment they had recently purchased. Slater determined that the machinery was not capable of producing good quality yarn and persuaded the owners to have him design new machinery. Slater found no mechanics in the U.S. when he arrived and had great difficulty finding someone to build the machinery. Eventually he located Oziel Wilkinson and his son David to produce iron castings and forgings for the machinery. According to [[David Wilkinson (machinist)|David Wilkinson]]: \"all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power\".<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |ref        = harv\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom\n}}\n</ref> By 1791 Slater had some of the equipment operating.

In 1801, however, Jefferson became president and turned to promoting a more decentralized, agrarian democracy called [[Jeffersonian democracy]]. (He based his philosophy on protecting the common man from political and economic tyranny. He particularly praised small farmers as \"the most valuable citizens\".) However, Jefferson did not change Hamilton's basic policies. As president in 1811 Madison let the bank charter expire, but the [[War of 1812]] proved the need for a national bank and Madison reversed positions. The [[Second Bank of the United States]] was established in 1816, with a 20-year charter.<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1958)</ref>\n\nThomas Jefferson was able to purchase the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803 for $15 million, although the treasury at the time only had $10 million. The [[Louisiana Purchase]] greatly expanded the size of the United States, adding extremely good farmland, the Mississippi River and the city of New Orleans.\nWars from 1793 to 1814 caused withdrawal of most foreign shipping from the U.S., leaving trade in the Caribbean and Central and South America open for the U.S. Seizure of U.S. ships by France and Britain during the Napoleonic Wars led to the Embargo Act of 1807 which prohibited most foreign trade.<ref name=\"North 1966\">{{cite book |title      = The Economic Growth of the United States 1790\u20131860\n |last       = North\n |first      = Douglas C.\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 1966\n |publisher  = W.

When he was elected for a second term, Jackson blocked the renewal of the bank's charter. Jackson opposed paper money and demanded the government be paid in gold and silver coins. The [[Panic of 1837]] stopped business growth for three years.<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Banks and Politics in America from the Revolution to the Civil War'' (1958); Taylor, ''The Transportation Revolution 1815\u20131860'' (1962)</ref>\n\n===Agriculture, commerce and industry===\n====Population growth====\nAlthough there was relatively little immigration from Europe, the [[American frontier|rapid expansion of settlements]] to the West, and the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, opened up vast frontier lands. The high birth rate, and the availability of cheap land caused the rapid expansion of population. The average age was under 20, with children everywhere. The population grew from 5.3 million people in 1800, living on 865,000 square miles of land to 9.6 million in 1820 on 1,749,000 square miles. By 1840, the population had reached 17,069,000 on the same land.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 '' (1976) series A-1 and A-2, p 8</ref>\n\nNew Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States and grew rapidly; entirely new cities were begun at Pittsburgh, Marietta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Nashville and points west. The coming of the steamboat after 1810 made upstream traffic economical on major rivers, especially the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (1951) pp 15\u201373.</ref> Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1815, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.<ref>Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).</ref>\n\n====Labor shortage====\nThe U.S. economy of the early 19th century was characterized by labor shortages, as noted by numerous contemporary observers. The labor shortage was attributed to the cheapness of land and the high returns on agriculture. All types of labor were in high demand, especially unskilled labor and experienced factory workers. Labor prices in the U.S. were typically between 30 and 50 percent higher than in Britain. Women factory workers were especially scarce. The elasticity of labor was low in part because of lack of transportation and low population density. The relative labor scarcity and high price was an incentive for capital investment, particularly in machinery.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century\n |url=https://archive.org/details/americanbritisht00haba\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Habakkuk\n |first= H.

Westward expansion plus the building of canals and the introduction of steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama, and new grain growing areas were brought into production in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Eventually this put severe downward pressure on prices, particularly of cotton, first from 1820 to 1823 and again from 1840 to 1843.\n\nBefore the [[Industrial Revolution]] most cotton was spun and woven near where it was grown, leaving little raw cotton for the international marketplace. World cotton demand experienced strong growth due to mechanized spinning and weaving technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Although cotton was grown in India, China, Egypt, the Middle East and other tropical and sub-tropical areas, the Americas, particularly the U.S., had sufficient suitable land available to support large scale cotton plantations, which were highly profitable.<ref>{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5}}</ref> A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi in 1806 would become the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|bolls]] that were three to four times faster to pick.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\">{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|114}}The cotton trade, excluding financing, transport and marketing, was 6 percent or less of national income in the 1830s.<ref name=\"North 1966 pp\"/> Cotton became the United States' largest export.\n\nSugar cane was being grown in Louisiana, where it was refined into granular sugar. Growing and refining sugar required a large amount of capital. Some of the nation's wealthiest people owned sugar plantations, which often had their own sugar mills.\n\nSouthern plantations, which grew cotton, sugar cane and tobacco, used African slave labor. Per capita food production did not keep pace with the rapidly expanding urban population and industrial labor force in the [[Antebellum Puzzle|Antebellum]] decades.<ref>{{cite journal|title=  Robert Fogel, Economic Growth, Population Theory, and Physiology: The Bearing of Long-Term Processes on the Making of Economic Policy |jstor= 2118058 |date= June 1994|journal =The American Economic Review |volume=84|issue=3 |pages= 369\u2013395 |issn= 0002-8282 |last1= Fogel |first1= Robert W. }}</ref>\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Rakeman \u2013 First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|300px|Construction of the first macadamized road in the United States (1823).

A ton-mile by wagon cost from between 30 and 70 cents in 1819. Robert Fulton's estimate for typical wagonage was 32 cents per ton-mile. The cost of transporting wheat or corn to Philadelphia exceeded the value at 218 and 135 miles, respectively.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133}}</ref> To facilitate westward expansion, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson began work on the [[Natchez Trace]], which was to connect [[Daniel Boone]]'s [[Wilderness Road]], which ended in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Mississippi River.\n\nFollowing the [[Louisiana Purchase]] the need for additional roads to the West were recognized by Thomas Jefferson, who authorized the construction of the [[National Road#Cumberland Road|Cumberland Road]] in 1806. The Cumberland Road was to connect Cumberland Maryland on the Potomac River with the Wheeling (West) Virginia on the Ohio River, which was on the other side of the [[Alleghany Mountains]]. Mail roads were also built to New Orleans.\n\nThe building of roads in the early years of the 19th century greatly lowered transportation costs and was a factor in the [[deflation]] of [[Panic of 1819|1819 to 1821, which was one of the most severe]] in U.S. history.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133\"/>\n\nSome turnpikes were wooden plank roads, which typically cost about $1,500 to $1,800 per mile, but wore out quickly.

H. Bartlett 1839)]]\nBecause a horse can pull a barge carrying a cargo of over 50 tons compared to the typical one ton or less hauled by wagon, and the horse required a wagoner versus a couple of men for the barge, water transportation costs were a small fraction of wagonage costs. Canals' shipping costs were between two and three cents per ton-mile, compared to 17\u201320 cents by wagon.<ref name=\"Atack & Passell 1994 pp\"/> The cost of constructing a typical canal was between $20,000 and $30,000 per mile.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=53}}</ref>\n\nOnly 100 miles of canals had been built in the U.S. by 1816, and only a few were longer than two miles. The early canals were typically financially successful, such as those carrying coal in eastern Pennsylvania, where canal building was concentrated until 1820.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atack & Passell|1994}}{{rp|154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe 325-mile [[Erie Canal]], which connected Albany, New York, on the Hudson River with Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie, began operation in 1825. Wagon cost from Buffalo to New York City in 1817 was 19.2 cents per ton-mile. By Erie Canal c. 1857 to 1860 the cost was 0.81 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=146}}</ref> The Erie Canal was a great commercial success and had a large regional economic impact.\n\nThe Delaware and Raritan Canal was also very successful. Also important was the [[Louisville and Portland Canal|2.5-mile canal]] bypassing the falls on the Ohio River at Louisville, which opened in 1830.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860\n |last=Taylor\n |first= George Rogers\n|authorlink=\n|year=1969 |publisher =\n|location=\n|isbn= 978-0873321013|pages=}}\n</ref>\n\nThe success of some of the early canals led to a canal building boom, during which work began on many canals which would prove to be financially unsuccessful. As the canal boom was underway in the late 1820s, a small number of horse railways were being built. These were quickly followed by the first steam railways in the 1830s.\n\n====Steam power====\nIn 1780 the United States had three major steam engines, all of which were used for pumping water: two in mines and one for New York City's water supply. Most power in the U.S. was supplied by water wheels and water turbines after their introduction in 1840. By 1807 when the ''[[North River Steamboat]]'' (unofficially called ''Clermont'') first sailed, there were estimated to be fewer than a dozen steam engines operating in the U.S. Steam power did not overtake water power until sometime after 1850.<ref name = \"Hunter 1985\">\n{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam Power\n|last=Hunter \n|first= Louis C.\n|authorlink=\n|year=1985\n|publisher =University Press of Virginia\n|location= Charlottesville\n|isbn= |page=|ref=harv}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] began developing a high pressure steam engine that was more practical than the engine developed around the same time by [[Richard Trevithick]] in England. The high pressure engine did away with the separate condenser and thus did not require cooling water. It also had a higher power to weight ratio, making it suitable for powering steamboats and locomotives.\n\nEvans produced a few custom steam engines from 1801 to 1806, when he opened the Mars Works iron foundry and factory in Philadelphia, where he produced additional engines. In 1812 he produced a successful Colombian engine at Mars Works. As his business grew and orders were being shipped, Evans and a partner formed the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Steam engines soon became common in public water supply, sawmills and flour milling, especially in areas with little or no water power.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, ''Oliver Evans, Inventive Genius of the American Industrial Revolution'' (Hagley Museum & Library, 1980).</ref>\n\n====Mechanical power transmission====\nIn 1828 Paul Moody substituted leather belting for gearing in mills.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=32}}</ref> Leather belting from [[line shaft]]s was the common way to distribute power from steam engines and water turbines in mills and factories.  In the factory boom of the late 19th century it was common for large factories to have many miles of line shafts.  Leather belting continued in use until it was displaced by unit drive electric motors in the early decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant\"/>\n\n====Shipbuilding====\nShipbuilding remained a sizable industry. U.S.-built ships were superior in design, required smaller crews and cost between 40 and 60 percent less to build than European ships. The British gained the lead in shipbuilding after they introduced iron-hulled ships in the mid 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=}}</ref>\n\n====Steamboats and steam ships====\n{{For|Steamboat monopoly|Gibbons v. Ogden}}\nCommercial steamboat operations began in 1807 within weeks of the launch of [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'', often referred to as the ''Clermont''.\n\nThe first steamboats were powered by [[Boulton and Watt]] type low pressure engines, which were very large and heavy in relation to the smaller high pressure engines. In 1807 Robert L. Stevens began operation of the ''[[Phoenix (boat)|Phoenix]]'', which used a high pressure engine in combination with a low pressure condensing engine. The first steamboats powered only by high pressure were the ''Aetna'' and ''Pennsylvania'' designed and built by [[Oliver Evans]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=14\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1811 to 1812, the ''[[New Orleans (steamboat)|New Orleans]]'' became the first steamboat to travel down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. The commercial feasibility of steamboats on the Mississippi and its tributaries was demonstrated by the ''[[Enterprise (1814)|Enterprise]]'' in 1814.\n\nBy the time of Fulton's death in 1815 he operated 21 of the estimated 30 steamboats in the U.S. The number of steamboats steadily grew into the hundreds. There were more steamboats in the Mississippi valley than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=63\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=63}}</ref>\n\nEarly steamboats took 30 days to travel from New Orleans to Louisville, which was from half to one-quarter the time by keel boat. Due to improvements in steamboat technology, by 1830 the time from New Orleans to Louisville was halved. In 1820 freight rates for keel boats were five cents per ton-mile versus two cents by steamboat, falling to one-half cent per pound by 1830.<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/46 46]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/46\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[SS Savannah]] crossed from Savannah to Liverpool in 1819 as the first trans-Atlantic steamship; however, until the development of more efficient engines, trans-ocean ships had to carry more coal than freight. Early trans-ocean steamships were used for passengers and soon some companies began offering regularly scheduled service.\n\n====Railroads====\nRailroads were an English invention, and the first entrepreneurs imported British equipment in the 1830s. By the 1850s the Americans had developed their own technology. The early lines in the 1830s and 1840s were locally funded, and connected nearby cities or connected farms to navigable waterways. They primarily handled freight rather than passengers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atack | Passell|1994|pp=429}}</ref> The first locomotives were imported from England. One such locomotive was the [[John Bull (locomotive)|John Bull]] which arrived in 1831. While awaiting assembly, [[Matthias W. Baldwin]], who had designed and manufactured a highly successful stationary steam engine, was able to inspect the parts and obtain measurements. Baldwin was already working on an experimental locomotive based on designs shown at the [[Rainhill Trials]] in England. Baldwin produced his first locomotive in 1832; he went on to found the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], one of the largest steam locomotive manufacturers. In 1833 when there were few locomotives in the U.S., three quarters were made in England. In 1838 there were 346 locomotives recorded in the U.S., three-fourths of which were made in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/236 236]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/236\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOhio had more railroads built in the 1840s than any other state. Ohio's railroads put the canals out of business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=46}}</ref> A typical mile of railroad cost $30,000 compared to the $20,000 per mile of canal, but a railroad could carry 50 times as much traffic. Railroads appeared at the time of the canal boom, causing its abrupt end, although some canals flourished for an additional half-century.\n\n====Manufacturing====\nStarting with textiles in the 1790s, factories were built to supply a regional and national market. The power came from waterfalls, and most of the factories were built alongside the rivers in rural New England and upstate New York.<ref>Victor Clark, ''History of manufactures in the United States: 1607\u20131860.

In 1810 the secretary of the treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including hosiery and linen, was produced by households.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=51}}</ref> By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores.<ref>David Montgomery, \"The Working Classes of the Pre-Industrial American City, 1780\u20131830,\" ''Labor History'' (1968) 9#1 pp 3\u201322, esp. p.4</ref> The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. [[Samuel Slater]] secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and built new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs.<ref>Barbara M. Tucker, ''Samuel Slater and the origins of the American textile industry: 1790\u20131860'' (1984)</ref> By the time the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] cut off trade with Britain, there were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used [[Water frame|Arckwright water frames]] powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=57\u20139}}</ref> In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the [[putting-out system]] of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] of the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the [[Tariff of 1816]], competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.<ref>Kenton Beerman, \"The Beginning of a Revolution: Waltham and the Boston Manufacturing Company.\" ''The Concord Review'' (1994) [http://teachers.hfcsd.org/webpages/tnassivera/files/the%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135758/http://teachers.hfcsd.org/webpages/tnassivera/files/the%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Fall River Manufactory]], located on the [[Quequechan River]] in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], was founded in 1813 by Dexter Wheeler and cousin David Anthony.

[[Honor\u00e9 Blanc]], who had served as inspector general of the three French arsenals, began producing muskets with interchangeable locks in France when [[Thomas Jefferson]] was minister to France. Jefferson wrote a letter to [[John Jay]] about these developments in 1785.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/> The idea of armament standardization was advocated by [[Louis de Tousard]], who fled the [[French Revolution]] and in 1795 joined the U.S. Corps of Artillerists and Engineers where he taught artillery and engineering he learned in France. At the suggestion of George Washington, Tousard had been working on an artillery manual, which he published as ''The American Artillerist's Companion'' (1809). Tousard's manual, which was a standard textbook for officer training, stressed the importance of  a system of standardized armaments.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nFears of war stemming from the [[XYZ Affair]] caused the U.S. to begin offering cash advance contracts for producing small arms to private individuals in 1798. Two notable recipients of these contracts associated with interchangeable parts were [[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]]. Although Whitney was not able to make interchangeable parts, he was a proponent of using machinery for gun making; however, he employed only the simplest machines in his factory. North eventually made progress toward some degree of interchangeability and developed special machinery. North's shop used the first known [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]] ({{circa|1816}}), a fundamental [[machine tool]].<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe experience of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with [[interchangeable parts]]. Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including [[Milling (machining)|milling machines]], grinders, shapers and [[Planer (metalworking)|planers]]. The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to a high degree of precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker [[Samuel Colt]], and machine tool makers [[James Nasmyth]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]], there was still some question about what constituted interchangeability and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe machinists' skills were called armory practice and the system eventually became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]]. [[Machinist]]s from the armories eventually spread the technology to other industries, such as clocks and watches, especially in the New England area. It wasn't until late in the 19th century that interchangeable parts became widespread in U.S. manufacturing. Among the items using interchangeable parts were some sewing machine brands and bicycles.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe development of these modern machine tools and machining practices made possible the development of modern industry capable of mass production; however, large scale industrial production did not develop in the U.S. until the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref><ref>Merritt Roe Smith, ''Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology: The Challenge of Change'' (1980)</ref><ref>David R.

It collapsed in 1836, under heavy attack from President [[Andrew Jackson]] during his [[Bank War]].<ref>Bray  Hammond, \"Andrew Jackson's Battle with the 'Money Power'\" ''American Heritage'' (June 1956) 7#4 [https://www.americanheritage.com/content/jackson%E2%80%99s-fight-%E2%80%98money-power%E2%80%99 online]</ref><ref>Robert V. Remini, ''Andrew Jackson and the bank war'' (1967).</ref>\n\nThere were three economic downturns in the early 19th century. The first was the result of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which shut off most international shipping and trade due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The embargo caused a depression in cities and industries dependent on European trade. The other two downturns were depressions accompanied by significant periods of deflation during the early 19th century. The first and most severe was during the depression from 1818 to 1821 when prices of agricultural commodities declined by almost 50 percent. A credit contraction caused by a financial crisis in England drained specie out of the U.S. The Bank of the United States also contracted its lending. The price of agricultural commodities fell by almost 50 percent from the high in 1815 to the low in 1821, and did not recover until the late 1830s, although to a significantly lower price level. Most damaging was the price of cotton, the U.S.'s main export. Food crop prices, which had been high because of the famine of 1816 that was caused by the [[year without a summer]], fell after the return of normal harvests in 1818. Improved transportation, mainly from turnpikes, significantly lowered transportation costs.<ref name=\"Taylor 1951\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860\n |last=Taylor\n |first= George Rogers\n|authorlink=\n|year=1951 |publisher = Rinehart & Co.\n|location=New York, Toronto\n|isbn= 978-0-87332-101-3|pages=133, 331\u20134}}\n</ref>\n\nThe third economic downturn was the depression of the late 1830s to 1843, following the [[Panic of 1837]], when the money supply in the United States contracted by about 34 percent with prices falling by 33 percent.

Branch mints at [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]]; [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], Georgia; and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]], North Carolina, were authorized by congress in 1835 and became operational in 1838.\n\nGold was being withdrawn from the U.S. by England and silver had also been taken out of the country because it had been under valued relative to gold by the [[Coinage Act of 1834]]. Canal projects began to fail. The result was the financial [[Panic of 1837]]. In 1838 there was a brief recovery. The business cycle upturn occurred in 1843.\n\nEconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era. For the most part, they follow the conclusions of [[Peter Temin]], who absolved Jackson's policies, and blamed international events beyond American control, such as conditions in Mexico, China and Britain. A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin's conclusion that \"the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis-a-vis the Second Bank of the U.S.\"<ref>Robert Whaples, \"Were Andrew Jackson's Policies 'Good for the Economy'?\" ''Independent Review'' (2014) 18#4 [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-362727309/were-andrew-jackson-s-policies-good-for-the-economy online]</ref>\n\n====Economics of the War of 1812====\nThe War of 1812 was financed by borrowing, by new issues of private bank notes and by an inflation in prices of 15%. The government was a very poor manager during the war, with delays in payments and confusion, as the Treasury took in money months after it was scheduled to pay it out.  Inexperience, indecision, incompetence, partisanship and confusion the main hallmarks. The federal government's management system was designed to minimize the federal role before 1812. The Republicans in power deliberately wanted to downsize the power and roles of the federal government; when the war began, the Federalist opposition worked hard to sabotage operations. Problems multiplied rapidly in 1812, and all the weaknesses were magnified, especially regarding the Army and the Treasury.  There were no serious reforms before the war ended.<ref>Leonard D. White, ''The Jeffersonians: A Study in Administrative History 1801 1829'' (1951) pp 118\u201319, 146, 216\u201337, 285, 419, 554</ref> In financial matters, the decentralizing ideology of the Republicans meant they wanted the [[First Bank of the United States]] to expire in 1811, when its 20-year charter ran out. Its absence made it much more difficult to handle the financing of the war, and cause special problems in terms of moving money from state to state, since state banks were not allowed to operate across state lines.  The bureaucracy was terrible, often missing deadlines.  On the positive side, over 120 new state banks were created all over the country, and they issued notes that financed much of the war effort, along with loans raised by Washington.  Some key Republicans, especially Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] realized the need for new taxes, but the Republican Congress was very reluctant and only raised small amounts.  The whole time, the Federalists in Congress and especially the Federalist-controlled state governments in the Northeast, and the Federalist-aligned financial system in the Northeast, was strongly opposed to the war and refused to help in the financing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker et al. eds.|title=The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVSrJBQYAk8C&pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=16\u201317|isbn=9781851099566}}.</ref>  Indeed, they facilitated smuggling across the Canadian border, and sent large amounts of gold and silver to Canada, which created serious shortages of specie in the US.<ref>Tucker, ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=hVSrJBQYAk8C&pg=PA210 p. 210]</ref>\n\nAcross the two and half years of the war, 1812\u20131815, the federal government took in more money than it spent.

The population of the West (generally meaning from Ohio to and including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri and south to include Kentucky) grew rapidly. The West was primarily a grain and pork producing region, with an important machine tool industry developing around Cincinnati, Ohio. The Southern economy was based on plantation agriculture, primarily cotton, tobacco and sugar, produced with slave labor.\n\nThe market economy and factory system were not typical before 1850, but developed along transportation routes. Steamboats and railroads, introduced in the early part of the century, became widespread and aided westward expansion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=215}}</ref> The telegraph was introduced in 1844 and was in widespread use by the mid 1850s.\n\nA machine tool industry developed and machinery became a major industry.

Hot blast is a method of using heat from the blast furnace exhaust gas to preheat combustion air, saving a considerable amount of fuel. It allowed much higher furnace temperatures and increased the capacity of furnaces.\n\nHot blast allowed blast furnaces to use [[anthracite]] or lower grade coal. Anthracite was difficult to light with cold blast. High quality metallurgical coking coal deposits of sufficient size for iron making were only available in Great Britain and western Germany in the 19th century,<ref>{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|pp=88}}</ref> but with less fuel required per unit of iron, it was possible to use lower grade coal.\n\nThe use of anthracite was rather short lived because the size of blast furnaces increased enormously toward the end of the century, forcing the use of [[coke (fuel)|coke]], which was more porous and did not impede the upflow of the gases through the furnace. Charcoal would have been crushed by the column of material in tall furnaces. Also, the capacity of furnaces would have eventually exceeded the wood supply, as happened with locomotives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=40\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIron was used for a wide variety of purposes. In 1860 large consumers were numerous types of castings, especially stoves. Of the $32 million of bar, sheet and railroad iron produced, slightly less than half was railroad iron. The value added by stoves was equal to the value added by rails.<ref name=\"North 1966 pp\">{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=}}</ref>\n\n====Coal displaces wood====\nCoal displaced wood during the mid-nineteenth century. In 1840 wood was the major fuel while coal production was minor. In 1850 wood was 90% of fuel consumption and 90% of that was for home heating. By 1880 wood was only 5% of fuel consumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=415}}</ref> Cast iron stoves for heating and cooking displaced inefficient fireplaces.  Wood was a byproduct of land clearing and was placed along the banks of rivers for steamboats. By mid century the forests were being depleted while steamboats and locomotives were using enough wood to create shortages along their routes; however, railroads, canals and navigable internal waterways were able to bring coal to market at a price far below the cost of wood. Coal sold in Cincinnati for 10 cents per bushel (94 pounds) and in New Orleans for 14 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=403\u201321}}</ref>\n\nCharcoal production was very labor and land intensive. It was estimated that to fuel a typical sized 100 ton of pig iron per week furnace in 1833 at a sustained yield, a timber plantation of 20,000 acres was required. The trees had to be hauled by oxen to where they were cut, stacked on end and covered with earth or put in a kiln to be charred for about a week. Anthracite reduced labor cost to $2.50 per ton compared to charcoal at $15.50 per ton.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= American Iron 1607\u20131900\n |last=Gordon\n |first= Robert B\n|authorlink=\n|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press\n|location=Baltimore and London\n|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |pages=45, 48\u201353 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=400}}</ref>\n\n====Manufacturing====\nManufacturing became well established during the mid 19th century.

Sewing machines were developed for sewing leather. A leather rolling machine eliminated hand hammering, and was thirty times faster. [[Thomas Blanchard (inventor)#Machine tools for gun making and pattern copying lathe|Blanchard lathes]] began being used for making shoe lasts (forms) in the 1850s, allowing the manufacture of standard sizes.<ref name=\"Thomson 1989\"/>\n\nBy the 1850s much progress had been made in the development of the [[sewing machine]], with a few companies making the machines, based on a number of patents, with no company controlling the right combination of patents to make a superior machine. To prevent damaging lawsuits, in 1856 several important patents were pooled under the [[Sewing Machine Combination]], which licensed the patents for a fixed fee per machine sold.\n\nThe sewing [[machine industry]] was a beneficiary of machine tools and the manufacturing methods developed at the Federal Armories. By 1860 two sewing machine manufacturers were using interchangeable parts.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe sewing machine increased the productivity of sewing cloth by a factor of 5.\n\nIn 1860 the textile industry was the largest manufacturing industry in terms of workers employed (mostly women and children), capital invest and value of goods produced.

According to the 1838 report there were an estimated 2,000 engines totaling 40,000&nbsp;hp, of which 64% were used in transportation, mostly in steamboats.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=69, 73}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Corliss steam engine]], patented in 1848, was called the most significant development in steam engineering since [[Watt steam engine|James Watt]]. The Corliss engine was more efficient than previous engines and maintained more uniform speed in response to load changes, making it suitable for a wide variety of industrial applications. It was the first steam engine that was suitable for cotton spinning. Previously steam engines for cotton spinning pumped water to a water wheel that powered the machinery.\n\nSteam power greatly expanded during the late 19th century with the rise of large factories, the expanded railroad network and early electric lighting and electric street railways.\n\n====Steamboats and ships====\nThe number of steamboats on western rivers in the U.S. grew from 187 in 1830 to 735 in 1860.

The U.S. tried to compete by building wooden [[Clipper|clipper ships]], which were fast, but too narrow to carry economic volumes of low value freight.\n\n====Telegraph====\nCongress approved funds for a short demonstration [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] [[Baltimore\u2013Washington telegraph line|line from Baltimore to Washington D.C.]], which was operational in 1844. The telegraph was quickly adopted by the railroad industry, which needed rapid communication to coordinate train schedules, the importance of which had been highlighted by a collision on the Western Railroad in 1841. Railroads also needed to communicate over a vast network in order to keep track of freight and equipment.<ref name=\"Chandler 1993 pp\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=}}</ref> Consequently, railroads installed telegraphs lines on their existing [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-ways]].

Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the Northeast; cotton cloth production was the leading industry, with the manufacture of shoes, woolen clothing, and machinery also expanding. Most of the workers in the new factories were immigrants or their children. Between 1845 and 1855, some 300,000 European immigrants arrived annually. Many remained in eastern cities, especially mill towns and mining camps, while those with farm experience and some savings bought farms in the West.<ref name=\"Walter Licht 1995\">Walter Licht, ''Industrializing America: The Nineteenth Century'' (1995)</ref>\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[File:Batteuse 1881.jpg|thumb|Threshing machine from 1881.

The Second Bank of the U.S. had also maintained some control over other banks, but in its absence banks were only under state regulation.<ref name=\"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nOne of the main problems with banks was over-issuance of [[banknotes]]. These were redeemable in specie (gold or silver) upon presentation to the chief cashier of the bank.<ref name=\"Atack & Passell 1994 469\"/> When people lost trust in a bank they rushed to redeem its notes, and because banks issued more notes than their specie reserves, the bank couldn't redeem the notes, often causing the bank to fail. In 1860 there were over 8,000 state chartered banks issuing notes. In 1861 the U.S. began issuing United States Notes as legal tender.<ref name=\"Fed_News_2013\">{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.frbservices.org/fedfocus/archive_fedcash/fedcash_0413_01.html?elq=76f341601598453f8ec4655651ea9a4a\n |title       = A Brief History of U.S. Paper Currency\n |author      = Federal Reserve Banks\n |date        = April 2013\n |publisher   = Federal Reserve Banks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151016025106/https://www.frbservices.org/fedfocus/archive_fedcash/fedcash_0413_01.html?elq=76f341601598453f8ec4655651ea9a4a\n |archivedate = 2015-10-16\n}}</ref>\n\nBanks began paying interest on deposits and using the proceeds to make short term ''call loans'', mainly to stock brokers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Huston|1986|pp=}}</ref>\n\nNew York banks created a [[Bankers' clearing house|clearing house]] association in 1853 in which member banks cleared accounts with other city banks at the close of the week. The clearinghouse association also handled notes from banks in other parts of the country. The association was able to detect banks that were issuing excessive notes because they could not settle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Huston|1986|pp=3}}</ref>\n\n====Panic of 1857====\nThe recovery from the depression that followed the [[Panic of 1837]] began in 1843 and lasted until the [[Panic of 1857]].\n\nThe panic was triggered by the August 24 failure of the well regarded Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co. A manager in the New York branch, one of the city's largest financial institutions, had embezzled funds and made excessive loans. The company's president announced suspension of specie redemption, which triggered a rush to redeem banknotes, causing many banks to fail because of lack of specie.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe United States had been running a trade deficit, draining gold out of the country. Because of the tariff revenues, the U.S. Treasury held a considerable amount of gold, which kept it out of circulation. On September 12, the [[SS Central America]], which was carrying $1.5 million in gold from California, sank, contributing to the panic. Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb came to the aid of New York mercantile interests by buying back some of the national debt. On September 25 the Bank of Pennsylvania suspended specie payment, starting a nationwide bank run.<ref name=\"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe danger of interest bearing deposits became apparent when bankers had to call loans made to stock brokers, many of whom were unable to pay. Banks then had to curtail credit to commercial and industrial customers. Many business were unable to pay workers back wages because they held so many worthless banknotes.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe [[Crimean War]], which had cut off Russian wheat exports, ended in 1856. The war had caused high wheat prices and overexpansion in the U.S., which had been exporting wheat to Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=209}}</ref> Bountiful western harvests in 1857 caused grain prices to fall. Good harvests in England, France and Russia caused collapse in demand for U.S. grains in 1858 and 1859. This caused railroad shipments from the West to fall, which resulted in the bankruptcy of some railroads.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe inability of the West to sell its crops hurt businesses in other regions, such as New England, which manufactured shoes sold in the West.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic [[modernization]] that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.<ref>Heather Cox Richardson, ''The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies during the Civil War'' (1997)</ref> For a list of the major industrialists see .\n\n=====Financing the war=====\n\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.<ref>Jane Flaherty, \"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', (2009) 55#2 pp. 244\u2013277 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v055/55.2.flaherty.html in Project MUSE]</ref> Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary [[Salmon P.

The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics.

Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\".

Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n======Tariffs======\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n=====Land grants=====\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] railroad construction was heavily subsidized (with much corruption), but the region maintained its dependence on cotton. Former slaves became wage laborers, [[tenant farmer]]s, or [[sharecropper]]s. They were joined by many poor whites, as the population grew faster than the economy. As late as 1940 the only significant manufacturing industries were textile mills (mostly in the upland Carolinas) and some steel in Alabama.<ref>Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy since the Civil War'' (1986).</ref><ref>Roger Ransom, ''Conflict and Compromise: The Political Economy of Slavery, Emancipation and the American Civil War'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe industrial advantages of the North over the South helped secure a Northern victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The Northern victory sealed the destiny of the nation and its economic system. The slave-labor system was abolished; sharecropping emerged and replaced slavery to supply the labor needed for cotton production, but cotton prices plunged during the Depression of 1873, leading Southern plantations to decline in profitability. Northern industry, which had expanded rapidly before and during the war, surged ahead.

Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Fourth the government printed \"greenbacks\"\u2014paper money\u2014which were controversial because they caused inflation.\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Congressman Justin Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue, but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>James L.

The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt.  The government did this by breaking it up into smaller plots for private ownership, through various federal laws.\n\nBounty-land warrants were issued to military veterans in the United States from 1775 to 1855.  The land grants were used extensively for settlement of pre-Louisiana Purchase lands east of the Mississippi River, including the [[Ohio Country]], the [[Northwest Territory]], and the [[Platte Purchase]] in Missouri.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/research/military/bounty-land-1775-1855.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=1165 | title=U.S. War Bounty Land Warrants, 1789-1858}}</ref>\n\nAbout 180 million acres were granted to railroad construction companies between 1850 and 1871.<ref name=\"gfeldmeth\">http://faculty.polytechnic.org/gfeldmeth/chart.land.pdf</ref>  The [[Land Grant Act of 1850]] provided for 3.75 million acres of land to the states to support railroad projects; by 1857 21 million acres of public lands were used for railroads in the [[Mississippi River]] valley, and the stage was set for more substantial Congressional subsidies to future railroads.<ref>Julian E. Zelizer, ''The American Congress: the building of democracy'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC&pg=PA288& p.288]</ref>\n\nThe [[Pacific Railroad Acts]] financed several [[transcontinental railroad]]s by granting land directly to corporations for the first time.  In addition to operating revenues, railroads were able to finance networks crossing vast distances by selling granted property adjacent to the tracks; these would become highly desirable plots for new settlers and businesses because of the easy access to long-distance transportation.\n\n[[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] starting in 1860 benefited colleges and universities.\n\nVarious [[Homestead Acts]] distributed land nearly for free in return for improvements such as building a house, farming, or planting trees. \nBetween 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed {{convert|270000000|acre|mi2}} of federal land for private ownership. This was a total of 10% of all land in the United States.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/homestead-act/ ''The Homestead Act of 1862'']; Archives.gov</ref>  Eligibility for the last such program, in Alaska, ended in 1986.<ref>US Department of the Interior, National Park Service.

Land grants creating the [[Indian Reservation]] system were used by the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1851 to segregate native tribes, but later acts opened some of that land to white settlement, notably including a [[land run]] opening the [[Unassigned Lands]] in Oklahoma. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 pressured Native Americans to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate to European-American culture]], offering former tribal land to individuals separating from their tribes and putting \"surplus\" reservation land up for auction.  Overall, about half of Indian Reservation land was sold to white Americans by 1906, about 75 million acres.<ref name=\"gfeldmeth\" />\n\n{{further|Land grant#United_States}}\n\n====Banking====\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.\n\n====Education====\nBritish Parliamentary Committee members [[Joseph Whitworth]] and [[George Wallis]] were very impressed at the educational level of workers in the U.S., commenting that \"...{{nbsp}}so that everybody reads ... and intelligence penetrates through the lowest grades of society.\"  They also remarked that most states had compulsory education laws requiring a minimum of three months per year schooling for child factory workers.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=174}}''The Industry of the United States in Machinery, Manufactures and Useful and Applied Arts'', compiled from the Official Reports of Messrs Whitworth and Wallis, London, 1854.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\nThe [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] grew rich fighting the war, as the Confederate economy was destroyed.<ref>Emerson David  Fite, ''Social and industrial conditions in the North during the Civil War'' (1910) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wI0-AAAAYAAJ  online edition]</ref> The [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in control in Washington had a Whig vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, national banks, and high-speed rail links. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit; with the South gone, and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war, and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for the most of the rest. (The remainder can be charged to inflation.) They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy. The key policy-maker in Congress was [[Thaddeus Stevens]], as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]]. He took charge of major legislation that funded the war effort and revolutionized the nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.<ref>{{cite book|author=Heather Cox Richardson|title=The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies During the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZVjReDrxKYC&pg=PA9|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=9, 41, 52, 111, 116, 120, 182, 202|isbn=9780674059658}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have debated whether or not the Civil War sped up the rate of economic growth in the face of destruction throughout the South and the diversion of resources to military supplies and away from civilian goods.

The old paper currency issued by state banks had been withdrawn, and Confederate currency was worthless. The national banks had issued $207 million in currency, which was backed by gold and silver. The federal treasury had issued $428 million in greenbacks, which was legal tender but not backed by gold or silver. In addition about $275 million of coin was in circulation. The new administration policy announced in October would be to make all the paper convertible into specie, if Congress so voted. The House of Representatives passed the Alley Resolution on December 18, 1865 by vote of 144 to 6. In the Senate it was a different matter, for the key player was Senator [[John Sherman]], who said that inflation contraction was not nearly as important as refunding the short-term and long-term national debt. the war had been largely financed by national debt, in addition to taxation and inflation. The national debt stood at $2.8 billion. By October 1865, most of it in short term and temporary loans.<ref>For an econometric approach see Lee E.

The goal premium over greenbacks was hundred and $145 in greenbacks to  $100 in gold, and the optimists thought that they heavy demand for currency in an era of prosperity would return the ratio to 100.<ref>Schell, 1930.</ref> A compromise was reached in April 1866, that limited the treasury to a currency contraction of only $10 million over six months. Meanwhile, the Senate refunded the entire national debt, but the House failed to act. By early 1867, postwar prosperity was a reality, and the optimists wanted an end to contraction, which Congress ordered in January 1868. Meanwhile, the Treasury issued new bonds at a lower interest rate to refinance the redemption of short-term debt. while the old state bank notes were disappearing from circulation, new national bank notes, backed by species, were expanding.

Steel rails lasted roughly ten times longer than iron rails. Steel rails, which became heavier as steel prices fell, enabled heavier, more powerful locomotives that could pull longer trains.

The [[Bessemer process]] was the first large scale process for producing steel, which it was able to do at low cost.  The first U.S. licensed Bessemer plant began operation in 1865. Bessemer steel was used mostly for rails.  Due to difficulty in controlling quality and embrittlement with aging, Bessemer steel was not suitable for structural purposes.\n\nThe Siemens-Martin process, or [[open hearth furnace|open hearth process]], produced a suitable grade structural steel. Open hearth steel displaced wrought iron as a structural material in the 1880s.  Open hearth steel began being used in a wide variety of applications including high rise buildings, ships, machinery, pipelines, rails and bridges.\n\n====Electric lights and electric street railways====\n{{Main|Electrification}}\nEarly electrification was too limited to have a big impact on the late 19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of power plants and the fact that most utilities offered only nighttime service. Daytime service became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the [[AC motor]], which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway ([[tram]] or streetcar).<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant 1991\">\n{{cite book |title      = A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power\n |last1      = Hunter\n |first1     = Louis C.\n |last2      = Bryant\n |first2     = Lynwood\n |year       = 1991\n |publisher  = MIT Press\n |location   = Cambridge, Massachusetts, London\n |isbn       = 978-0-262-08198-6\n |page       = \n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/historyofindustr00hunt\n}}\n</ref>\n\nElectric street railways were introduced in the U.S. in 1888 when [[Frank J.

They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved. The farther west the settlers went, the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market, and the more inclined they were to protest, as in the Populist movement of the 1890s. Wheat farmers blamed local [[grain elevator]] owners (who purchased their crop), railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices.<ref name=\"Elwyn B. Robinson 1982 p 203\">Elwyn B.

The Granges focused initially on social activities to counter the isolation most farm families experienced. Women's participation was actively encouraged. Spurred by the Panic of 1873, the Grange soon grew to 20,000 chapters and 1.5 million members. The Granges set up their own marketing systems, stores, processing plants, factories and [[cooperative]]s. Most went bankrupt. The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s. A few Midwestern states passed \"[[Granger Laws]]\", limiting railroad and warehouse fees.<ref name=\"D. Sven Nordin 1974\">D. Sven Nordin, ''Rich Harvest: A History of the Grange, 1867\u20131900'' (1974)</ref>\n\nFederal land grants helped each state create an agricultural college and a network of extension agents who demonstrated modern techniques to farmers. Wheat and cotton farmers in the 1890s supported the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] movement, but failed in their demands for free silver and inflation. Instead the 1896 election committed the nation to the gold standard and a program of sustained industrialization. Farmers in the Midwest and East gave verbal support to the Populists. They focused on the nearby urban markets, rather than on highly fluctuating European markets for weaving cotton.\n\n====Oil, minerals and mining====\n=====Oil=====\n{{Details|Standard Oil}}\n[[File:John D. Rockefeller 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John D. Rockefeller]]]]\nIn the 1850s an advance in lighting was the use of kerosene lamps with glass chimneys, which produced a good quality light at a relatively affordable price.  Kerosene lighting effectively extended the day and made it easier to read at night.  An industry developed to produce [[coal oil]], as kerosene was then called.<ref name=\"Yergin\">{{cite book |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power |last=Yergin |first= Daniel |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-4391-1012-6 |pages= |url=}}</ref>  Kerosene was also being distilled from Pennsylvania crude oil by [[Samuel Kier]].\n\n[[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]] paid a visit [[Dartmouth College]], which he had attended, and saw a sample of \"rock oil\" from Pennsylvania. Suspecting that the oil may have potential as an illuminant and lubricant, he organized an investor group.  In 1853 Bissell's group, which became the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co., hired Yale chemistry professor [[Benjamin Silliman, Jr.]] to perform an analysis of \"rock oil\". Silliman's report of April 1864 stated that \"rock oil\" could yield an excellent illuminating oil.  However, there was no economical means for producing sufficient commercial quantities of oil.  Bissell had a chance insight when he saw a picture of oil derricks used to produce an oil based patent medicine obtained as a byproduct of a brine well.<ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\nFollowing a shareholder disagreement, Bissell and fellow investor [[Jonathan Greenleaf Eveleth|Jonathan Eveleth]] investor split with Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. and formed Seneca Oil in 1858.  [[Edwin Drake]], a shareholder, was hired by the company to drill for oil.  The site chosen to drill the well was on Oil Creek near Titusville, PA, where a water well was producing oil.  Drake chose to use brine well drilling technology based on the technique used in China since ancient times that reached the West in the late 1820s, except that Drake used iron cable, an iron well casing and a steam engine.  The [[Drake Well]] hit oil at a depth of 69.55 feet on August 27, 1858, starting a drilling  boom in the region.<ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\nAmong the numerous refineries that were started were several along a new rail link to Cleveland, Ohio, where [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his partner Maurice Clark owned a grocery produce shipping business.  Rockefeller and Clark also got in the refining business, and in 1865 the partners decided to hold a private auction between the two, with Rockefeller being the successful bidder.  The refining industry was intensely competitive, and by 1869 there was three times the capacity needed, a situation which lasted many years, with the number of refineries reaching 6000.\n\nIn 1870 John D. Rockefeller, his brother [[William Rockefeller]], [[Henry Flagler]], [[Oliver Burr Jennings]] and silent partner [[Stephen V. Harkness]] formed [[Standard Oil]].  John D. Rockefeller was the master planner and organizer of the systematic plan to form combinations with or acquire competitors and enter all phases of the oil industry from production to transportation, refining and distribution, a concept called [[vertical integration]]. Standard Oil sought every possible advantage over its competitors.  One method was using Standard's high shipping volume to secure discounts and drawbacks (payments from railroads for transporting competitors products) from railroads.  By 1879 Standard oil controlled 90% of U.S. refining capacity.  Producers in the Pennsylvania oil region tried to counter Standard Oil's transportation arrangements buy building the first long distance pipeline, the 110 mile long Tidewater Pipeline to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, which was on the Reading Railroad.  Standard Oil fought back by building four pipelines of its own.  Standard continued to monopolize the oil industry in the U.S. until it was broken up by the 1911 supreme court case [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]].\n\nEfficient gas mantles and electric lighting were eroding the illuminating oil market beginning in the 1880s; however a previously low value byproduct of refining was gasoline, which more than offset the role of kerosene in the early 20th century.<ref name= \"Nye 1990\"/><ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\n=====Coal=====\nCoal was found in abundance in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from Pennsylvania south to [[Kentucky]].\n\n=====Iron ore=====\nLarge iron ore mines opened in the [[Lake Superior]] region of the upper Midwest.

However, a sharp break in the growth rate to around 2.8% occurred from 1910 to 1929. Economists are uncertain what combination of supply and demand factors caused the break, but productivity growth was strong, enabling the labor cost per unit of output to decline from 1910 to 1929. The growth rate in hours worked fell 57% compared to the decline in the growth rate of output of 27%.  It is generally accepted that the new technologies and more efficient business methods permanently shifted the supply and demand relationship for labor, with labor being in surplus (except during both world wars when the economy was engaged in war-time production and millions of men served in the armed forces).  The technologies that became widespread after 1910, such as electrification, internal powered transportation and mass production, were capital saving. Total non-residential fixed business fell after 1910 due to the fall of investment in structures.<ref>{{ Cite journal\n| last1 = Vatter\n| last2 = Walker\n| last3 =Alperovitz\n| first1 = Harold G.\n| first2 = John F.\n| first3 =Gar\n| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910\u20131990, Journal of Economic Issues\n| year = 2005\n| url = \n}}</ref>\n\n===Industry, commerce and agriculture===\n{{Details|Causes of the Great Depression#Specific theories of cause#Productivity shock}}\nTwo of the most transformative technologies of the century were widely introduced during the early decades: [[electrification]], powered by high pressure boilers and [[steam turbine]]s and automobiles and trucks powered by the [[internal combustion engine]].<ref name=\"Godron_2016\" /><ref name=\"Constable_2003\">{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives\n|last=Constable |first=George\n|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location= |isbn= 978-0309089081 |pages= |url=|date=2003-01-01 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book |title=Transforming the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations and Their Consequences\n|last=Smil |first=Vaclav|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|location=Oxford, New York\n|isbn= 9780195168754|page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_kRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22United%20States%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nChain stores experienced rapid growth.<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/>\n\nStandardization was urged by Dept. of Commerce for consumer goods such as bedspreads and screws.

Electric motors that were used in daytime, such as the [[DC motor]]s that powered street railways, helped balance the load, and many street railways generated their own electricity and also operated as electric utilities.  The [[AC motor]], developed in the 1890s, was ideal for industrial and commercial power and greatly increased the demand for electricity, particular during daytime.<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant\">{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power\n|last1=Hunter\n|first1=Louis C.\n|last2=Bryant\n|first2=Lynwood\n|year=1991\n|publisher=MIT Press\n|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts\n|isbn=978-0-262-08198-6\n|page=\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofindustr00hunt\n}}</ref>\n\nElectrification in the U.S. started in industry around 1900, and by 1930 about 80% of power used in industry was electric.

By 1940 almost all urban households had electricity. Electrical appliances such as irons, cooking appliances and washing machines were slowly adopted by households.

Many large central power stations, equipped with high pressure boilers and steam turbine generators began being built after 1913. These central stations were designed for efficient handling of coal from the layout of the rail yards to the conveyor systems.  They were also much more fuel efficient, lowering the amount of fuel per kilowatt-hour of electricity to a small fraction of what it had been. In 1900 it took 7 lbs coal to generate one kilowatt hour.

Ford Motor Co. used techniques of scientific management although [[Henry Ford]] claimed not to know of the Taylor's system. Ford Motor used every practical means to reduce the effort and movement of workers in order to reduce the time involved in making parts, moving parts and assembling parts into automobiles. Ford used electric powered factories and in 1913 Ford introduced the [[assembly line]], a step in the process that became known as ''[[mass production]]''.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>  The price of a [[Ford Model T]] fell from $900 in 1908\u20139 to $360 in 1916, despite the fact that wages doubled to $5 per day in 1914.

Important examples include aluminum made by the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process and chlorine and caustic (sodium and potassium compounds). Chlorine and caustic had been produced by chemical processes but producing aluminum this way was prohibitively expensive. A large plant using Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process was opened in Pittsburgh, USA in 1888 and others opened around the world. Falling electricity prices in the early 20th century greatly lowered the cost of making electrochemicals. There was high demand for aluminum for aircraft during World War I and afterward for commercial aviation.\n\nSome other electrochemicals are chromium, manganese and tungsten.\n\nChlorine began being used for treating household water to kill microorganisms.\n\n====Railroads====\n{{Main|Rail transportation in the United States}}\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the railroad network had over-expanded with many miles of unprofitable routes. In 1906 Congress gave the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate freight rates and the industry was unable to increase revenue enough to cover rising costs. By 1916, the peak year of track mileage, one-sixth of the nations railroad trackage was in bankruptcy.\n\nThe railroads proved inadequate to the increased freight volume created by [[World War I]]. There were major traffic jams in the system and critical supplies were experiencing delays. In December 1917 the railroads were taken over by the government and put under control of the [[United States Railroad Administration]] (USRA). The USRA ordered 1,930 new standardized steam locomotives and over 100,000 railcars. The USRA's control over the railroads ended  in March 1920.\n\n====Automobiles and trucks====\n[[File:File-Firestone Edison Ford and Fred Seely Grove Park Inn Asheville 1918.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Harvey Firestone]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[Fred Loring Seely|Fred Seely]] in Asheville, North Carolina, 1918]]\nBy the dawn of the 20th century, automobiles had begun to replace horse-drawn carriages.<ref>John F.

The rate of decline was most rapid in 1950s\u20131960s, the reason for this was because of the increased innovation in farms where new technology was able to create more product which resulted in the need for fewer farms. Also during the 1950s\u20131960s people moved from the bigger cities and farms to more suburban areas so these smaller farms would be sold and people would move closer to cities. People also could not afford the new technologies to help them farm so bigger farms would be very successful during this time, while smaller farms would close.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/u-s-agriculture-in-the-twentieth-century/ | title=U.S. Agriculture in the Twentieth Century}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n=====Telephone=====\nBefore 1900 telephones were used primarily by businesses.

The triode [[vacuum tube]] made it possible to build amplifiers for broadcasting and for receivers. Radio circuit design also advanced, allowing better signals with less noise.

The stock market had its best year in history in 1916. The U.S. gold reserves doubled between 1913 and 1918, causing the price level to rise. Interest rates had been held low to minimize interest on war bonds, but after the final war bonds were sold in 1919, the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate from 4% to 6%. Interest rates rose and the money supply contracted. The economy entered the [[Depression of 1920-21]], which was a sharp decline financially.

The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] reduced the quota from 3% to 2% and added additional restrictions on certain nationalities.\n\nIn the early years of American history, most political leaders were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of transportation. In general, they accepted the concept of [[laissez-faire]], a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude started to change during the latter part of the 19th century, when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf.<ref name=\"Harold U.

Known as [[Progressives]], these people favored government regulation of business practices to, in their minds, ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the [[Interstate Commerce Act]]), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1901\u20131909), Democrat President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913\u20131921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. [[Ida M.

This period of prosperity, along with the culture of the time, was known as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The rapid growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil, glass, and road-building. Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a much wider radius for their shopping. Small cities prospered, and large cities had their best decade ever, with a boom in construction of offices, factories and homes. The new electric power industry transformed both business and everyday life. Telephones and electricity spread to the countryside, but farmers never recovered from the wartime bubble in land prices.

The U.S. money supply began to contract by one-third. The protectionist [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]] incited retaliation by Canada, Britain, Germany and other trading partners. Congress, in 1932, worried about the rapidly growing deficit and national debt, and raised income tax rates. Economists generally agree that these measures deepened an already serious crisis. By 1932, the unemployment rate was 25%. Conditions were worse in heavy industry, lumbering, export agriculture (cotton, wheat, tobacco), and mining. Conditions were not quite as bad in white collar sectors and in light manufacturing.<ref>Broadus Mitchell, ''The Depression Decade: From New Era through New Deal, 1929\u20131941'' (1947)</ref>\n\n[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was elected President in 1932 without a specific program.

Roosevelt balanced the \"regular\" budget the emergency budget was funded by debt, which increased from 33.6% of GNP in 1932 to 40.9% in 1936.[1] Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists, most notably John Maynard Keynes in Britain. Roosevelt met Keynes but did not pay attention to his recommendations. After a meeting with Keynes, who kept drawing diagrams, Roosevelt remarked that \"He must be a mathematician rather than a political economist\". John Keynes approach to the great depression could have been a solution. His method was to keep the feds spending as much as they could even on random purchases but the money had to keep moving. It is believed that if America went through with John Keynes plan the Great Depression could have been avoided entirely. The Feds started to spend more when President Roosevelt came in to office as the federal government doubled income tax rates in 1932. Total government tax revenues as a percentage of GDP shot up from 10.8% in 1929 to 16.6% in 1933. Higher tax rates tended to reduce consumption and aggregate demand. Spending would go up and America would get out of the great depression when World War II happened after Japan\u2019s attack on American forces in Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 led to much sharper increases in government purchases, and the economy pushed quickly into an inflationary gap.\n.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moggridge |first=Donald Edward |title=Maynard Keynes: An Economist's Biography |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-05141-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/maynardkeyneseco0047mogg/page/582 582] |url=https://archive.org/details/maynardkeyneseco0047mogg |url-access=registration |accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://open.lib.umn.edu/macroeconomics/chapter/17-1-the-great-depression-and-keynesian-economics/ | title=17.1 the Great Depression and Keynesian Economics \u2013 Principles of Macroeconomics}}</ref>\n\n====Banking crisis====\nIn 1929\u201333 the economy was destabilized by bank failures. The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by [[bank run]]s. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers lost confidence in their deposits (which were not insured) and rushed to withdraw their deposits. Runs destabilized many banks to the point where they faced bankruptcy. Between 1929 and 1933 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) went bankrupt.<ref>R. W. Hafer, ''The Federal Reserve System'' (Greenwood, 2005) p  18</ref> Much of the [[Great Depression]]'s economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.<ref>[[Ben Bernanke]], \"Nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great Depression\", (1983) ''American Economic Review'' .

The act was passed and signed into law the same day. It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the [[Federal Reserve System]] reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6 billion; depositors lost a total of $540 million, and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Milton Friedman |author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz |title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7J_EUM3RfoC&pg=PA427 |year=1963 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-00354-2 |pages=438\u20139}}</ref> The [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms to regulate speculations.

Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs. The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref><ref>Robert  A.

However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief. They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC, and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.<ref>Donald S. Howard, ''The WPA and Federal Relief Policy'' (1943) [https://www.questia.com/library/1220692/the-wpa-and-federal-relief-policy Online edition]</ref>\n\n====Relief====\nThe extent to which the spending for relief and public works provided a sufficient stimulus to revive the U.S. economy, or whether it harmed the economy, is also debated. If one defines economic health entirely by the gross domestic product, the U.S. had gotten back on track by 1934, and made a full recovery by 1936, but as Roosevelt said, one third of the nation was ill fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed. See Chart 3. GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than 1932, and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. The economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime, and then grew another 56% from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime. The unemployment rate fell from 25.2% in 1932 to 13.9% in 1940 when the draft started. During the war the economy operated under so many different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime, such as massive spending, price controls, bond campaigns, controls over raw materials, prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles, rationing, guaranteed cost-plus profits, subsidized wages, and the draft of 12 million soldiers.\n\n[[File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|lang=en|thumb|Chart 3: GDP annual pattern and long-term trend, 1920\u201340, in billions of constant dollars<ref>based on data in Susan Carter, ed.

A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/economy/2008/04/11/did-the-new-deal-work.html|title=Did the New Deal Work}}</ref> The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist [[Eric Rauchway]] of the [[University of California]] stated \"very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms\", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Fannie Mae. Regardless, unemployment peaked in 1932 at 25% and was reduced to 13.9% by 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eh.net/lists/archives/eh.res/feb-1997/0010.php |title=EH.R: FORUM: The Great Depression |publisher=Eh.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080616030525/http://eh.net/lists/archives/eh.res/feb-1997/0010.php |archivedate =2008-06-16 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nAs Broadus Mitchell summarized, \"Most indexes worsened until the summer of 1932, which may be called the low point of the depression economically and psychologically\".<ref>Mitchell p 404</ref> Economic indicators show the American economy declined until February 1933. After Roosevelt took office, there began a steady, sharp upward recovery that persisted until the brief [[Recession of 1937\u20131938]] (see graph) after which they continued their upward climb. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production bottomed at 52.8 on July 1, 1932 and was practically unchanged at 54.3 on March 1, 1933; however by July 1, 1933, it had climbed to 85.5 (with 1935\u201339 = 100, and for comparison 2005 = 1,342).<ref>[http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/INDPRO.txt Industrial Production Index] Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US)</ref>\n\n====New Deal impact====\nA 2017 review of the published scholarship summarized the findings of researchers as follows:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fishback|first=Price|date=2017|title=How Successful Was the New Deal?

The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.</blockquote>\n\n===Wartime output and controls: 1940\u20131945===\n[[File:Women aluminum shells wwii.jpg|thumb|Women making aluminum shells for the war in 1942]]\nUnemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service.\n\nAll economic sectors grew during the war. Farm output went from an index (by volume) of 106 in 1939 to 128 in 1943. Coal output went from 446 million tons in 1939 to 651 in 1943; oil from 1.3 billion barrels to 1.5 billion. Manufacturing output doubled, from a volume index of 109 in 1939 to 239 in 1943. Railroads strained to move it all to market, going from an output of 13.6 billion loaded car miles in 1939 to 23.3 in 1943.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1946'' (1946) pp 507, 629, 749, 755, 811.

Converted consumer-products plants filled many military orders. Automakers built tanks and aircraft, for example, making the United States the \"arsenal of democracy\". In an effort to prevent rising national income and scarce consumer products from causing inflation, the newly created [[Office of Price Administration]] rationed and set prices for consumer items ranging from sugar to meat, clothing and gasoline, and otherwise tried to restrain price increases. It also set rent in war centers.<ref>Harold G.

Some were replacing men away in the military. These working women were symbolized by the fictional character of [[Rosie the Riveter]]. After the war many women returned to household work as men returned from military service.

Bill]] financed a well-educated work force. The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period\u2014labor union membership peaked historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities\u2014a process largely completed by 1960.\n\nCongress created the [[Council of Economic Advisors]], to promote high employment, high profits and low inflation. The Eisenhower administration (1953\u20131961) supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish [[Keynesianism]] as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation.

So the well-organized Farm Bureau and other lobbyists, worked in the 1970s to appeal to urban Congressman through  food stamp programs for the poor. By 2000, the food stamp program was the largest component of the farm bill. In 2010, the [[Tea Party movement]] brought in many Republicans committed to cutting all federal subsidies, including those agriculture. Meanwhile, urban Democrats strongly opposed reductions,  pointing to the severe hardships caused by the 2008\u201310 economic recession. The [[Agricultural Act of 2014]] saw many rural Republican Congressman voting against the program despite its support from farmers; it passed with urban support.<ref>Christopher  Bosso, ''Framing the Farm Bill: Interests, Ideology, and Agricultural Act of 2014'' (2017).</ref><ref>Carl Zulauf and David Orden, \"The US Agricultural Act of 2014: Overview and Analysis.\" (International Food Policy Research Institute  discussion paper 01393, 2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Orden2/publication/308138378_The_US_Agricultural_Act_of_2014/links/57dae99e08ae5292a3768d07.pdf online].</ref><ref>David Orden and Carl Zulauf, \"Political economy of the 2014 farm bill.\" ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' 97.5 (2015): 1298\u20131311.

The United States was the leading producer of combat aircraft during World War II and had a large surplus of machine tools and manufacturing facilities for airplanes at the end of the war.[3] There were also experienced airplane manufacturing and maintenance personnel. Additionally, radar had been developed just before the war.\n\nThe aircraft industry had the highest productivity growth of any major industry, growing by 8.9% per year in 1929\u20131966.\n\nDuring World War 2 the United States hired hundreds of thousands of workers put them all in 4 major factories and had a government budget of over 3 billion dollars which would be have been 50,024,489,795.92 dollars in 2017. The B-29 project required the US Army Air Forces to have unprecedented organizational capabilities as this project included several major private contractors and labor unions. American aircraft production was the single largest sector of the war economy, costing $45 billion (almost a quarter of the $183 billion spent on war production), employing a staggering two million workers, and, most importantly, producing over 125,000 aircraft.\n\nProduction of Selected U.S. Military Aircraft (1941\u20131945): Bombers-49,123 Fighters-63,933 Cargo-14,710 Total-127,766\n<ref name=\"Rosenberg-1982\">{{cite book |title= Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last= Rosenberg |first= Nathan |authorlink=  |year= 1982 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge, New York |isbn= 978-0-521-27367-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/164 164] |ref= harv |url= https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/164 }}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\nVery little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War II, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing non-farm units had been constructed from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 units built annually from 1946 through 1955.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States '' (1976) series H-156</ref>\n\nThe G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization \u2013 for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves, allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools.<ref>Joseph Goulden, ''The Best Years, 1945\u20131950'' (1976) pp 135\u201339.</ref> The most famous development was [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.<ref>Barbara Mae Kelly, ''Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown'' (SUNY Press, 1993).</ref>\n\n===Interstate highway system===\nConstruction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] began in 1956.\n\n===Computer technology===\n{{Main|Computer}}\nMainframe business computer systems were introduced in the 1950s following the manufacture of [[transistor]]s. Mainframe computers\nwere in widespread use by the 1960s. These computers handled a variety of accounting, billing and payroll applications.\n\nOne highly significant application was the [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre airline reservations system]], which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre reservations could be placed remotely using teleprinters and all functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This eliminated manually handling file cards.\n\n===Fiscal policy===\nFederal taxes on incomes, profits and payrolls had risen to high levels during World War II and had been cut back only slowly; the highest rates for individuals reached the 90% level. Congress cut tax rates in 1964. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963\u201369) dreamed of creating a \"[[Great Society]]\", and began many new social programs to that end, such as [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].\n\n===Military and space spending===\nAfter the [[Cold War]] began in 1947, and especially after the [[Korean War]] began in 1950, the government adopted a strategy in [[NSC 68]] military spending.<ref>Ken Young, \"Revisiting NSC 68,\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (2013) 15#1 pp: 3\u201333.</ref> Economists examined how much this \"military Keynesianism\" stimulated the economy.<ref>Alex Mintz, and Alexander Hicks. \"Military Keynesianism in the United States, 1949\u20131976: Disaggregating military expenditures and their determination.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' (1984): 411\u2013417 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2779222 in  JSTOR].</ref>\n\nPresident Eisenhower feared that excessive military spending would damage the economy, so he downsized the Army after Korea and shifted priorities to missiles and nuclear weapons (which were much less expensive than army divisions). He also promoted the [[Interstate Highway]] system as necessary for national defense, and made space exploration a priority. His successor [[John F. Kennedy]] made a manned mission to the moon a national priority. Much of the new spending went to California and the West, a continuation of wartime spending.<ref>Kevin Fernlund, ''The Cold War American West'' (1998)</ref>\n\nAn even greater impact came in the South, where it stimulated a modernization of the economy away from cotton towards manufacturing and high technology. For example, there were new, large technologically sophisticated installations at the Atomic Energy Commission's [[Savannah River Site]] in South Carolina; the [[Redstone Arsenal]] at Huntsville in Alabama; nuclear research facilities at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]; and space facilities at [[Space Coast|Cape Canaveral]], Florida, at the [[Lyndon B.

The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from [[OPEC]] after [[Oil reserves in the United States|peaking production]] in 1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]. [[Stagflation]] gripped the nation, and the government experimented with [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] under [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]].\nThe [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] collapsed in 1971\u20131972, and President Nixon closed the gold window at the Federal Reserve, taking the United States entirely off the [[gold standard]].<ref name=\"Michael French 1997\"/>\n\nPresident [[Gerald Ford]] introduced the slogan, \"[[Whip Inflation Now]]\" (WIN). In 1974, productivity shrunk by 1.5%, though this soon recovered. In 1976, [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Presidency. Carter would later take much of the blame for the even more turbulent economic times to come, though some{{who|date=September 2011}} say circumstances were outside his control. Inflation continued to climb skyward. Productivity growth was small, when not negative. Interest rates remained high, with the prime reaching 20% in January 1981; [[Art Buchwald]] quipped that 1980 would go down in history as the year when it was cheaper to borrow money from the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] than the local bank.<ref name=\"Michael French 1997\">Michael French,  ''US  Economic History since 1945'' (1997)</ref>\n\nUnemployment dropped mostly steadily from 1975 to 1979, although it then began to rise sharply.\n\nThis period also saw the increased rise of the environmental and consumer movements, and the government established new regulations and regulatory agencies such as the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], and others.\n\n===Deregulation and Reaganomics: 1976\u20131992===\nDeregulation gained momentum in the mid-1970s, spurred by slow productivity growth and increasing operation and capital costs in several key sectors. It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful deregulation legislation, the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], was cleared by Congress. Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980, with the deregulation of railroads and trucking. Deregulation of interstate buses followed in 1982. In addition to transportation deregulation, savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] in 1980 and the [[Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]] in 1982.\n\nOn a broader front, the economy initially recovered at a brisk pace from the [[1973\u201375 recession]]. Incoming president [[Jimmy Carter]] instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy. However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose by double digits following the [[1979 energy crisis]].

Levy, ''Encyclopedia of the Reagan-Bush Years'' (1996)</ref>\n\nThe advent of deindustrialization in the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Great Divergence (inequality)|saw income inequality increase dramatically]] to levels never seen before. But at the same time, most orthodox economists, and most policy makers, pointed to the fact that consumers could buy so many goods, even with the inflation of the 1970s, as evidence that the general shift away from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread prosperity. In 1968, the U.S. [[Gini coefficient]] was 0.386. In 2005, the American Gini coefficient had reached 0.469.\n\nCritics of economic policies favored by Republican and Democratic administrations since the 1960s, particularly those expanding \"free trade\" and \"open markets\" (see [[Neoliberalism]]) say that these policies, though benefiting trading as well as the cost of products in the U.S., could have taken their own on the prosperity of the America middle-class. But in this period, consumers were buying as never before with so many products and goods at such low costs and in high quantities. Critics however argued that this consumer behavior was giving a false reading of the health of the economy, because it was being paid for by taking on rapidly increasing levels of indebtedness, thus covering up the stagnating wages and earnings of most of the workforce.\n\n===The rise of globalization: 1990s \u2013 late 2000===\n{{Main|New economy|1990s United States boom}}\n[[File:Comparison of three stock indices after 1975.svg|thumb|300px|This graph shows three major stock indices since 1975. Notice the meteoric rise of the stock market in the 1990s, followed by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2000 on the tech-heavy [[NASDAQ]].]]\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[government debt]] increased by 75%, GDP rose by 69%, and the stock market as measured by the [[S&P 500]] grew more than threefold.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000 real output increased, inflation was manageable and unemployment dropped to below 5%, resulting in a soaring stock market known as the [[dot-com boom]]. The second half of the 1990s was characterized by well-publicized [[initial public offering]]s of high-tech and \"[[dot-com company|dot-com]]\" companies. By 2000, however, it was evident a bubble in stock valuations ''had'' occurred, such that beginning in March 2000, the market would give back some 50% to 75% of the growth of the 1990s.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Update section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|Economy of the United States}}\nThe economy worsened in 2001 with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures rising substantially, and [[early 2000s recession|triggering a recession]] that is often blamed on the [[September 11 attacks]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAn additional factor in the fall of the US markets and in investor confidence included numerous [[list of corporate scandals|corporate scandals]].\n\nIn 2001\u20132007, the red-hot housing market across the United States fueled a false sense of security regarding the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\n===Great Recession===\n{{Further|Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u201310}}\n\nThe Great Recession was a sharp decline in the United States' economy. In 2008, a series of related economic disasters hit the American and European financial systems. The bursting of a worldwide bubble in housing set the recession in motion. The end of [[United States housing bubble|housing bubbles]] in California, Florida and Arizona led to the collapse of housing prices and the shrinkage of construction sector. Millions of [[mortgages]] (averaging about $200,000 each) had been bundled into securities called [[collateralized debt obligation]]s that were resold worldwide. Many banks and hedge funds had borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to buy these securities, which were now \"[[toxic asset#Debt repackaging and subprime crisis|toxic]]\" because their value was unknown and no one wanted to buy them.<ref>Charles R. Morris, ''The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash'' (2009)</ref>\n\nA series of the largest banks in the U.S. and Europe collapsed; some went bankrupt, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] with $690&nbsp;billion in assets; others such as the leading [[American International Group|insurance company AIG]], the leading bank [[Citigroup]], and the two largest mortgage companies were bailed out by the government. Congress voted $700&nbsp;billion in bailout money, and the Treasury and Federal Reserve committed trillions of dollars to shoring up the financial system, but the measures did not reverse the declines. Banks drastically tightened their lending policies, despite infusions of federal money. The government for the first time took major ownership positions in the largest banks. The stock market plunged 40%, wiping out tens of trillions of dollars in wealth; housing prices fell 20% nationwide wiping out trillions more. By late 2008 distress was spreading beyond the financial and housing sectors, especially as the \"Big Three\" of the automobile industry ([[General Motors]], [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]) were on the verge of bankruptcy, and the retail sector showed major weaknesses. Critics of the $700&nbsp;billion [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]] (TARP) expressed anger that much of the TARP money that has been distributed to banks is seemingly unaccounted for, with banks being secretive on the issue.<ref>Mauro F.

The plan is largely based on the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian theory]] that government spending should offset the fall in private spending during an economic downturn; otherwise the fall in private spending may perpetuate itself and productive resources, such as the labor hours of the unemployed, will be wasted. Critics claim that government spending cannot offset a fall in private spending because government must borrow money from the private sector in order to add money to it. However, most economists do not think such \"[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]\" is an issue when [[Zero interest rate policy|interest rates are near zero]] and the economy is [[economic stagnation|stagnant]]. Opponents of the stimulus also point to problems of possible future inflation and [[government debt]] caused by such a large expenditure.<ref>Mark H.

Settlers had to depend on what they could hunt and gather, what they brought with them, and uncertain shipments of food, tools, and supplies until they could build shelters and forts, clear land, and grow enough food, as well as build gristmills, sawmills, ironworks, and blacksmith shops to be self-supporting. They also had to defend themselves against raids from hostile Indians. After 1629 population growth was very rapid due to high birth rates (8 children per family versus 4 in Europe) and lower death rates than in Europe, in addition to immigration.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=1}}</ref> The long life expectancy of the colonists was due to the abundant supplies of food and firewood and the low population density that limited the spread of infectious diseases. The death rate from diseases, especially malaria, was higher in the warm, humid southern colonies than in cold New England.\n\nThe higher birth rate was due to better employment opportunities. Many young adults in Europe delayed marriage for financial reasons, and there were many servants in Europe who were not permitted to marry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=1\u20135}}</ref>\nThe population of white settlers grew from an estimated 40,000 in 1650 to 235,000 in 1700. In 1690, there were an estimated 13,000 black slaves. The population grew at an annual rate of over 3% throughout the 18th century, doubling every 25 years or less.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=x}}</ref> By 1775 the population had grown to 2.6 million, of which 2.1 million were white, 540,000 black and 50,000 Native American, giving the colonies about one-third of the population of Britain. The three most populated colonies in 1775 were Virginia, with a 21% share, and Pennsylvania and Massachusetts with 11% each.\n\n===The economy===\nThe colonial economy of what would become the United States was pre-industrial, primarily characterized by subsistence farming. Farm households also were engaged in handicraft production, mostly for home consumption, but with some goods sold.<ref name=\"Perkins 1988 pp\">{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[market economy]] was based on extracting and processing natural resource and agricultural products for local consumption, such as mining, [[gristmill]]s and sawmills, and the export of agricultural products. The most important agricultural exports were raw and processed feed grains (wheat, Indian corn, rice, bread and flour) and tobacco.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=31}}</ref> Tobacco was a major crop in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] region and rice a major crop in [[South Carolina]]. Dried and salted fish was also a significant export. North Carolina was the leading producer of naval stores, which included [[turpentine]] (used for lamps), rosin (candles and soap), [[tar]] (rope and wood preservative) and [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] (ships' hulls). Another export was [[potash]], which was derived from hardwood ashes and was used as a [[fertilizer]] and for making soap and glass.\n\nThe colonies depended on Britain for many finished goods, partly because laws prohibited making many types of finished goods in the colonies. These laws achieved the intended purpose of creating a trade surplus for Britain. The colonial balance trade in goods was heavily in favor of Britain; however, American shippers were able to offset roughly half of the goods trade deficit with revenues earned by shipping between ports within the British Empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=24, 28}}</ref>\n\nThe largest non-agricultural segment was ship building, which was from 5 to 20% of total employment.<ref>\n{{cite book |title      = A New Economic View of American History\n |last1      = Atack\n |first1     =fake stuiuuud\n |last2      = Passell\n |first2     = Peter\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 1994\n |publisher  = W.W.

Except for slaves, [[standards of living]] were generally high\u2014higher, in fact, than in England itself.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds., ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) chapter 7</ref>\n\n====New England====\nThe [[History of New England|New England]] region's economy grew steadily over the entire colonial era, despite the lack of a staple crop that could be exported. All the provinces and many towns as well, tried to foster economic growth by subsidizing projects that improved the infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, inns and ferries. They gave bounties and subsidies or monopolies to sawmills, grist mills, [[iron mill]]s, pulling mills (which treated cloth), salt works and glassworks. Most important, colonial legislatures set up a legal system that was conducive to business enterprise by resolving disputes, enforcing contracts, and protecting property rights. Hard work and entrepreneurship characterized the region, as the Puritans and Yankees endorsed the \"[[Protestant Work Ethic|Protestant Ethic]]\", which enjoined men to work hard as part of their divine calling.<ref>Margaret Alan Newell, \"The Birth of New England in the Atlantic Economy: From its Beginning to 1770,\" in Peter Temin, ed., ''Engines of Enterprise: An Economic History of New England'' (Harvard UP, 2000), pp. 11\u201368, esp. p. 41</ref>\n\nThe benefits of growth were widely distributed in New England, reaching from merchants to farmers to hired laborers. The rapidly growing population led to shortages of good farm land on which young families could establish themselves; one result was to delay marriage, and another was to move to new lands farther west. In the towns and cities, there was strong entrepreneurship, and a steady increase in the specialization of labor. Wages for men went up steadily before 1775; new occupations were opening for women, including weaving, teaching, and tailoring. The region bordered New France, and in the numerous wars the British poured money in to purchase supplies, build roads and pay colonial soldiers. The coastal ports began to specialize in fishing, international trade and shipbuilding\u2014and after 1780 in whaling. Combined with growing urban markets for farm products, these factors allowed the economy to flourish despite the lack of technological innovation.<ref>[[Gloria L. Main]] and Jackson T.

The American Revolution cut off imports from Britain, and stimulated a manufacturing sector that made heavy use of the entrepreneurship and mechanical skills of the people. In the second half of the 18th century, difficulties arose from the shortage of good farmland, periodic money problems, and downward price pressures in the export market. <ref>Bruce C.

He argues they grew from small villages to take major leadership roles in promoting trade, land speculation, immigration, and prosperity, and in disseminating the ideas of the Enlightenment, and new methods in medicine and technology. \nFurthermore, they sponsored a consumer taste for English amenities, developed a distinctly American educational system, and began systems for care of people in need.\n\nThe colonists were not remarkable by European standards, but they did display certain distinctly American characteristics, according to Bridenbaugh. There was no aristocracy or established church, there was no long tradition of powerful guilds. The colonial governments were much less powerful and intrusive than corresponding national governments in Europe. They experimented with new methods to raise revenue, build infrastructure, and solve urban problems.<ref>Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in the Wilderness-The First Century of Urban Life in America 1625\u20131742'' (1938) [https://www.questia.com/library/7916885/cities-in-the-wilderness-the-first-century-of-urban online edition]</ref> They were more democratic than European cities, in that a large fraction of the men could vote, and class lines were more fluid. Contrasted to Europe, printers (especially as newspaper editors) had a much larger role in shaping public opinion, and lawyers moved easily back and forth between politics and their profession. Bridenbaugh argues that by the mid-18th century, the middle-class businessmen, professionals, and skilled artisans dominated the cities. He characterizes them as \"sensible, shrewd, frugal, ostentatiously moral, generally honest,\" public spirited, and upwardly mobile, and argues their economic strivings led to \"democratic yearnings\" for political power.<ref>Carl Bridenbaugh, ''Cities in Revolt: Urban Life in America, 1743\u20131776'' (1955), pp 147, 332</ref><ref>Benjamin L.

He argues that working class artisans and skilled craftsmen made up a radical element in Philadelphia that took control of the city starting about 1770 and promoted a radical Democratic form of government during the revolution. They held power for a while, and used their control of the local militia to disseminate their ideology to the working class, and to stay in power until the businessmen staged a conservative counterrevolution.<ref>Gary B.

Colonies were used as suppliers of raw materials and as markets for manufactured goods while being prohibited from engaging in most types of manufacturing.<ref name=Stark_2005/>{{rp|214}}  The colonial powers of England, France, Spain and the Dutch Republic tried to protect their investments in colonial ventures by limiting trade between each other's colonies.\n\nSpain clung to old style mercantilism, primarily concerned with enriching the Spanish government by accumulating gold and silver, mainly from mines in their colonies. The Dutch and particularly the British approach was more conducive to private business.<ref>{{cite book|title= A Patriot's History of the United States|last1= Schweikart|first1= Larry|last2= Allen|first2= Michael|year= 2004|publisher= Sentinel, member of Penguin Group|location= USA|isbn= 978-1595230010|pages= [https://archive.org/details/patriotshistoryo00larr_0/page/12 12\u201317]|url= https://archive.org/details/patriotshistoryo00larr_0/page/12}}</ref>\n\nA mercantile policy that affected the British American colonies was the [[Navigation Acts]], which were passed by the British Parliament between 1651 and 1673.\n\nImportant features of the Navigation Acts are:\n* Foreign vessels were excluded from carrying trade between ports within the British Empire\n* Manufactured goods from Europe to the colonies had to pass through England\n* Enumerated items, which included furs, ship masts, rice, indigo and tobacco, were only allowed to be exported to Great Britain.\n\nAlthough the Navigation Acts were enforced, they had a negligible effect on commerce and profitability of trade. In 1770 illegal exports and smuggling to the West Indies and Europe were about equal to exports to Britain.<ref name=Stark_2005>{{cite book|title= The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism and Western Success|url= https://archive.org/details/victoryofreasonh00star|url-access= registration|last= Stark|first= Rodney |year= 2005 |publisher =Random House Trade Paperbacks|location= New York |isbn=978-0-8129-7233-7|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|216}}\n\nOn the eve of independence Britain was in the early stage of the [[Industrial Revolution]], with cottage industries and workshops providing finished goods for export to the colonies. At that time, half of the wrought iron, beaver hats, cordage, nails, linen, silk, and printed cotton produced in Britain were consumed by the British American colonies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=26}}</ref>\n\n====Free enterprise====\nThe domestic economy of the British American colonies enjoyed a great deal of freedom, although some of their freedom was due to lack of enforcement of British regulations on commerce and industry. [[Adam Smith]] used the colonies as an example of the benefits of free enterprise.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perkins|1988|pp=13}}</ref> Colonists paid minimal taxes.\n\nSome colonies, such as Virginia, were founded principally as business ventures. England's success at colonizing what would become the United States was due in large part to its use of [[charter companies]]. Charter companies were groups of stockholders (usually merchants and wealthy landowners) who sought personal economic gain and, perhaps, wanted also to advance England's national goals. While the private sector financed the companies, the king also provided each project with a charter or grant conferring economic rights as well as political and judicial authority. The colonies did not show profits, however, and the disappointed English investors often turned over their colonial charters to the settlers. The political implications, although not realized at the time, were enormous. The colonists were left to build their own governments and their own economy.\n\n====Taxation====\nThe colonial governments had few expenses and taxes were minimal.\n\nAlthough the colonies provided an export market for finished goods made in Britain or sourced by British merchants and shipped from Britain, the British incurred the expenses of providing protection against piracy by the British Navy and other military expenses. An early tax was the [[Molasses Act]] of 1733.\n\nIn the 1760s the London government raised small sums by new taxes on the colonies. This occasioned an enormous uproar, from which historians date the origins of the American Revolution. The issue was not the amount of the taxes\u2014they were quite small\u2014but rather the constitutional authority of Parliament versus the colonial assemblies to vote taxes.<ref>Edmund Morgan, and Helen M.

The British tried to crush the American economy with a blockade of all ports, but with 90% of the people in farming, and only 10% in cities, the American economy proved resilient and able to support a sustained war, which lasted from 1775 to 1783.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds., ''A Companion to the American Revolution'' (2004) chapters 42, 48</ref>\n\n[[File:A Picturesque View of the State of the Nation for February 1778 (caricature) RMG PU4786.jpg|thumb|Revolutionary era cartoon showing US sawing of the horn of a cow (symbolizing a break from British commerce) with a distressed Englishman watching as other European powers wait to collect milk.

The Treasury borrowed 40% of the money it needed and raised the rest through an efficient system of taxation.<ref>Paul Kennedy, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers'' (1987) p. 81, 119</ref><ref>John Brewer, ''The sinews of power: war, money, and the English state, 1688\u20131783'' (1990) p 91</ref> Heavy spending brought France to the [[Causes of the French Revolution#Economics and finances|verge of bankruptcy and revolution]].\n\nCongress and the American states had no end of difficulty financing the war.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962) pp 23\u201344</ref> In 1775 there was at most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover existing transactions, let alone on a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen, and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise it would be made good after the war. Indeed, in 1783 the soldiers and officers were given land grants to cover the wages they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781, when [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was named [[Superintendent of Finance of the United States]], did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters. Morris used a French loan in 1782 to set up the private [[Bank of North America]] to finance the war. Seeking greater efficiency, Morris reduced the civil list, saved money by using competitive bidding for contracts, tightened accounting procedures, and demanded the federal government's full share of money and supplies from the states.<ref>Charles Rappleye, ''Robert Morris: Financier of the American Revolution'' (2010) pp 225\u201352</ref>\n\nCongress used four main methods to cover the cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in specie (gold and silver).<ref>Oliver Harry Chitwood, ''A History of Colonial America'' (1961) pp 586\u2013589</ref> Congress made two issues of paper money, in 1775\u20131780, and in 1780\u201381. The first issue amounted to 242&nbsp;million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was \"not worth a Continental\", as people said, and a second issue of new currency was attempted. The second issue quickly became nearly worthless\u2014but it was redeemed by the new federal government in 1791 at 100 cents on the dollar. At the same time the states, especially Virginia and the Carolinas, issued over 200&nbsp;million dollars of their own currency. In effect, the paper money was a hidden tax on the people, and indeed was the only method of taxation that was possible at the time. The skyrocketing inflation was a hardship on the few people who had fixed incomes\u2014but 90 percent of the people were farmers, and were not directly affected by that inflation. Debtors benefited by paying off their debts with depreciated paper.<ref>Ralph Volney Harlow, \"Aspects of Revolutionary Finance, 1775\u20131783\", ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 35, No. 1 (Oct., 1929), pp. 46\u201368 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838471 in JSTOR]</ref> The greatest burden was borne by the soldiers of the Continental Army, whose wages\u2014usually in arrears\u2014declined in value every month, weakening their morale and adding to the hardships suffered by their families.\n\nStarting in 1776, the Congress sought to raise money by loans from wealthy individuals, promising to redeem the bonds after the war. The bonds were in fact redeemed in 1791 at face value, but the scheme raised little money because Americans had little specie, and many of the rich merchants were supporters of the Crown. Starting in 1776, the French secretly supplied the Americans with money, gunpowder and munitions in order to weaken its arch enemy, Great Britain. When France officially entered the war in 1778, the subsidies continued, and the French government, as well as bankers in Paris and Amsterdam loaned large sums to the American war effort. These loans were repaid in full in the 1790s.<ref>E. James Ferguson, ''The power of the purse: A history of American public finance, 1776\u20131790'' (1961)</ref>\n\nBeginning in 1777, Congress repeatedly asked the states to provide money. But the states had no system of taxation either, and were little help. By 1780 Congress was making requisitions for specific supplies of corn, beef, pork and other necessities\u2014an inefficient system that kept the army barely alive.<ref>Erna Risch, ''Supplying Washington's Army'' (1982)</ref><ref>E. Wayne Carp, ''To Starve the Army at Pleasure: Continental Army Administration and American Political Culture, 1775\u20131783'' (1990)</ref>\n\nThe cities played a major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775\u201383. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the blockade by the British Navy. Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776\u201383, and the others for briefer periods. During the occupations they were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. When the British finally departed in 1783, they took out large numbers of wealthy merchants who resumed their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.<ref>Curtis P. Nettles, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962)</ref>\n\n==The new nation==\n[[File:GROWTH1850.JPG|thumb|350px|Chart 1: trends in economic growth, 1700\u20131850]]\n\nThe [[U.S. Constitution]], adopted in 1787, established that the entire nation was a unified, or common market, with no internal tariffs or taxes on interstate commerce. The extent of federal power was much debated, with [[Alexander Hamilton]] taking a very broad view as the first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] during the presidential administration of [[George Washington]]. Hamilton successfully argued for the concept of \"[[implied powers]]\", whereby the federal government was authorized by the Constitution to create anything necessary to support its contents, even if it not specifically noted in it (build lighthouses, etc.). He succeeded in building strong national credit based on taking over the state debts and bundling them with the old national debt into new securities sold to the wealthy. They in turn now had an interest in keeping the new government solvent. Hamilton funded the debt with tariffs on imported goods and a highly controversial tax on whiskey. Hamilton believed the United States should pursue economic growth through diversified shipping, manufacturing, and banking. He sought and achieved Congressional authority to create the [[First Bank of the United States]] in 1791; the charter lasted until 1811.<ref>Curtis P. Nettels, ''The Emergence of a National Economy, 1775\u20131815'' (1962)</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the older cities finally restored their economic basis; newer growing cities included Salem, Massachusetts (which opened a new trade with China), New London, Connecticut, and Baltimore, and Maryland. The Washington administration under the leadership of Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton set up a national bank in 1791, and local banks began to flourish in all the cities. Merchant entrepreneurship flourished and was a powerful engine of prosperity in the cities.<ref>Robert A. East, \"The Business Entrepreneur in a Changing Colonial Economy, 1763\u20131795,\" ''Journal of Economic History''\n (May, 1946), Vol. 6, Supplement pp. 16\u201327 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2113072 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nWorld peace lasted only a decade, for in 1793 a two decades of war between Britain and France and their allies broke out. As the leading neutral trading partner the United States did business with both sides. France resented it, and the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798\u201399 disrupted trade. Outraged at British impositions on American merchant ships, and sailors, the Jefferson and Madison administrations engaged in economic warfare with Britain [[Embargo of 1807|1807\u20131812]], and then [[War of 1812|full-scale warfare 1812 to 1815]].\n\n===Industry and commerce===\n====Transportation====\nThere were very few roads outside of cities and no canals in the new nation. In 1792 it was reported that the cost of transport of many crops to seaport was from one-fifth to one half their cost.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=34}}</ref> The cheapest form of transportation was by water, along the seacoast or on lakes and rivers.  In 1816 it was reported that \"A ton of goods could be brought 3000 miles from Europe for about $9, but for that same sum it could be moved only 30 miles in this country\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|year-1969}}</ref>{{rp|132}}\n\n====Automatic flour mill====\nIn the mid 1780s [[Oliver Evans]] invented a [[Oliver Evans#Developing the Automatic Flour Mill, 1783\u20131790|fully automatic mill]] that could process grain with practically no human labor or operator attention. This was a revolutionary development in two ways: 1) it used bucket elevators and conveyor belts, which would eventually revolutionize materials handling, and 2) it used [[centrifugal governor|governors]], a forerunner of modern automation, for control.\n\n====Cotton gin====\n[[File:Cotton gin harpers.jpg|thumb|\"The First Cotton Gin\" conjectural image from 1869]]\nCotton was at first a small-scale crop in the South.

Britain prohibited the export of textile machinery and designs and did not allow mechanics with such skills to emigrate.\n[[Samuel Slater]], who worked as mechanic at a cotton spinning operation in England, memorized the design of the machinery. He was able to disguise himself as a laborer and emigrated to the U.S., where he heard there was a demand for his knowledge. In 1789 Slater began working as a consultant to Almy & Brown in Rhode Island who were trying to successfully spin cotton on some equipment they had recently purchased. Slater determined that the machinery was not capable of producing good quality yarn and persuaded the owners to have him design new machinery. Slater found no mechanics in the U.S. when he arrived and had great difficulty finding someone to build the machinery. Eventually he located Oziel Wilkinson and his son David to produce iron castings and forgings for the machinery. According to [[David Wilkinson (machinist)|David Wilkinson]]: \"all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by [[Samuel Slater|Mr. Slater]] was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power\".<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |ref        = harv\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom\n}}\n</ref> By 1791 Slater had some of the equipment operating.

In 1801, however, Jefferson became president and turned to promoting a more decentralized, agrarian democracy called [[Jeffersonian democracy]]. (He based his philosophy on protecting the common man from political and economic tyranny. He particularly praised small farmers as \"the most valuable citizens\".) However, Jefferson did not change Hamilton's basic policies. As president in 1811 Madison let the bank charter expire, but the [[War of 1812]] proved the need for a national bank and Madison reversed positions.

The high birth rate, and the availability of cheap land caused the rapid expansion of population. The average age was under 20, with children everywhere. The population grew from 5.3 million people in 1800, living on 865,000 square miles of land to 9.6 million in 1820 on 1,749,000 square miles. By 1840, the population had reached 17,069,000 on the same land.<ref>Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970 '' (1976) series A-1 and A-2, p 8</ref>\n\nNew Orleans and St. Louis joined the United States and grew rapidly; entirely new cities were begun at Pittsburgh, Marietta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Nashville and points west. The coming of the steamboat after 1810 made upstream traffic economical on major rivers, especially the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers.<ref>George Rogers Taylor, ''The transportation revolution, 1815\u20131860'' (1951) pp 15\u201373.</ref> Historian Richard Wade has emphasized the importance of the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system in which everything flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1815, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.<ref>Richard C. Wade, ''The urban frontier: pioneer life in early Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Lexington, Louisville, and St. Louis'' (1959).</ref>\n\n====Labor shortage====\nThe U.S. economy of the early 19th century was characterized by labor shortages, as noted by numerous contemporary observers. The labor shortage was attributed to the cheapness of land and the high returns on agriculture. All types of labor were in high demand, especially unskilled labor and experienced factory workers. Labor prices in the U.S. were typically between 30 and 50 percent higher than in Britain. Women factory workers were especially scarce. The elasticity of labor was low in part because of lack of transportation and low population density. The relative labor scarcity and high price was an incentive for capital investment, particularly in machinery.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=American and British Technology in the Nineteenth Century\n |url=https://archive.org/details/americanbritisht00haba\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Habakkuk\n |first= H.

Westward expansion plus the building of canals and the introduction of steamboats opened up new areas for agriculture. Much land was cleared and put into growing cotton in the Mississippi valley and in Alabama, and new grain growing areas were brought into production in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Eventually this put severe downward pressure on prices, particularly of cotton, first from 1820 to 1823 and again from 1840 to 1843.\n\nBefore the [[Industrial Revolution]] most cotton was spun and woven near where it was grown, leaving little raw cotton for the international marketplace. World cotton demand experienced strong growth due to mechanized spinning and weaving technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Although cotton was grown in India, China, Egypt, the Middle East and other tropical and sub-tropical areas, the Americas, particularly the U.S., had sufficient suitable land available to support large scale cotton plantations, which were highly profitable.<ref>{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5}}</ref> A strain of cotton seed brought from Mexico to Natchez, Mississippi in 1806 would become the parent genetic material for over 90% of world cotton production today; it produced [[Cotton Boll|bolls]] that were three to four times faster to pick.<ref name=\"Beckert_2014\">{{cite book|title= Empire of Cotton: A Global History|last=Beckert|first= Sven|year= 2014|publisher =Vintage Books Division Penguin Random House |location=US|isbn= 978-0-375-71396-5|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|114}}The cotton trade, excluding financing, transport and marketing, was 6 percent or less of national income in the 1830s.<ref name=\"North 1966 pp\"/> Cotton became the United States' largest export.\n\nSugar cane was being grown in Louisiana, where it was refined into granular sugar. Growing and refining sugar required a large amount of capital. Some of the nation's wealthiest people owned sugar plantations, which often had their own sugar mills.\n\nSouthern plantations, which grew cotton, sugar cane and tobacco, used African slave labor. Per capita food production did not keep pace with the rapidly expanding urban population and industrial labor force in the [[Antebellum Puzzle|Antebellum]] decades.<ref>{{cite journal|title=  Robert Fogel, Economic Growth, Population Theory, and Physiology: The Bearing of Long-Term Processes on the Making of Economic Policy |jstor= 2118058 |date= June 1994|journal =The American Economic Review |volume=84|issue=3 |pages= 369\u2013395 |issn= 0002-8282 |last1= Fogel |first1= Robert W. }}</ref>\n\n====Roads====\n[[File:Rakeman \u2013 First American Macadam Road.jpg|thumb|300px|Construction of the first macadamized road in the United States (1823).

A ton-mile by wagon cost from between 30 and 70 cents in 1819. Robert Fulton's estimate for typical wagonage was 32 cents per ton-mile. The cost of transporting wheat or corn to Philadelphia exceeded the value at 218 and 135 miles, respectively.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133}}</ref> To facilitate westward expansion, in 1801 Thomas Jefferson began work on the [[Natchez Trace]], which was to connect [[Daniel Boone]]'s [[Wilderness Road]], which ended in Nashville, Tennessee, with the Mississippi River.\n\nFollowing the [[Louisiana Purchase]] the need for additional roads to the West were recognized by Thomas Jefferson, who authorized the construction of the [[National Road#Cumberland Road|Cumberland Road]] in 1806. The Cumberland Road was to connect Cumberland Maryland on the Potomac River with the Wheeling (West) Virginia on the Ohio River, which was on the other side of the [[Alleghany Mountains]]. Mail roads were also built to New Orleans.\n\nThe building of roads in the early years of the 19th century greatly lowered transportation costs and was a factor in the [[deflation]] of [[Panic of 1819|1819 to 1821, which was one of the most severe]] in U.S. history.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=133\"/>\n\nSome turnpikes were wooden plank roads, which typically cost about $1,500 to $1,800 per mile, but wore out quickly.

H. Bartlett 1839)]]\nBecause a horse can pull a barge carrying a cargo of over 50 tons compared to the typical one ton or less hauled by wagon, and the horse required a wagoner versus a couple of men for the barge, water transportation costs were a small fraction of wagonage costs. Canals' shipping costs were between two and three cents per ton-mile, compared to 17\u201320 cents by wagon.<ref name=\"Atack & Passell 1994 pp\"/> The cost of constructing a typical canal was between $20,000 and $30,000 per mile.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=53}}</ref>\n\nOnly 100 miles of canals had been built in the U.S. by 1816, and only a few were longer than two miles. The early canals were typically financially successful, such as those carrying coal in eastern Pennsylvania, where canal building was concentrated until 1820.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atack & Passell|1994}}{{rp|154\u20135}}</ref>\n\nThe 325-mile [[Erie Canal]], which connected Albany, New York, on the Hudson River with Buffalo, New York, on Lake Erie, began operation in 1825. Wagon cost from Buffalo to New York City in 1817 was 19.2 cents per ton-mile. By Erie Canal c. 1857 to 1860 the cost was 0.81 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=146}}</ref> The Erie Canal was a great commercial success and had a large regional economic impact.\n\nThe Delaware and Raritan Canal was also very successful. Also important was the [[Louisville and Portland Canal|2.5-mile canal]] bypassing the falls on the Ohio River at Louisville, which opened in 1830.<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860\n |last=Taylor\n |first= George Rogers\n|authorlink=\n|year=1969 |publisher =\n|location=\n|isbn= 978-0873321013|pages=}}\n</ref>\n\nThe success of some of the early canals led to a canal building boom, during which work began on many canals which would prove to be financially unsuccessful. As the canal boom was underway in the late 1820s, a small number of horse railways were being built. These were quickly followed by the first steam railways in the 1830s.\n\n====Steam power====\nIn 1780 the United States had three major steam engines, all of which were used for pumping water: two in mines and one for New York City's water supply. Most power in the U.S. was supplied by water wheels and water turbines after their introduction in 1840. By 1807 when the ''[[North River Steamboat]]'' (unofficially called ''Clermont'') first sailed, there were estimated to be fewer than a dozen steam engines operating in the U.S. Steam power did not overtake water power until sometime after 1850.<ref name = \"Hunter 1985\">\n{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam Power\n|last=Hunter \n|first= Louis C.\n|authorlink=\n|year=1985\n|publisher =University Press of Virginia\n|location= Charlottesville\n|isbn= |page=|ref=harv}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Oliver Evans]] began developing a high pressure steam engine that was more practical than the engine developed around the same time by [[Richard Trevithick]] in England. The high pressure engine did away with the separate condenser and thus did not require cooling water. It also had a higher power to weight ratio, making it suitable for powering steamboats and locomotives.\n\nEvans produced a few custom steam engines from 1801 to 1806, when he opened the Mars Works iron foundry and factory in Philadelphia, where he produced additional engines. In 1812 he produced a successful Colombian engine at Mars Works. As his business grew and orders were being shipped, Evans and a partner formed the [[Pittsburgh Steam Engine Company]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Steam engines soon became common in public water supply, sawmills and flour milling, especially in areas with little or no water power.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, ''Oliver Evans, Inventive Genius of the American Industrial Revolution'' (Hagley Museum & Library, 1980).</ref>\n\n====Mechanical power transmission====\nIn 1828 Paul Moody substituted leather belting for gearing in mills.<ref>{{Harvnb|Thomson|2009|pp=32}}</ref> Leather belting from [[line shaft]]s was the common way to distribute power from steam engines and water turbines in mills and factories.  In the factory boom of the late 19th century it was common for large factories to have many miles of line shafts.  Leather belting continued in use until it was displaced by unit drive electric motors in the early decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant\"/>\n\n====Shipbuilding====\nShipbuilding remained a sizable industry. U.S.-built ships were superior in design, required smaller crews and cost between 40 and 60 percent less to build than European ships. The British gained the lead in shipbuilding after they introduced iron-hulled ships in the mid 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=}}</ref>\n\n====Steamboats and steam ships====\n{{For|Steamboat monopoly|Gibbons v. Ogden}}\nCommercial steamboat operations began in 1807 within weeks of the launch of [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'', often referred to as the ''Clermont''.\n\nThe first steamboats were powered by [[Boulton and Watt]] type low pressure engines, which were very large and heavy in relation to the smaller high pressure engines. In 1807 Robert L. Stevens began operation of the ''[[Phoenix (boat)|Phoenix]]'', which used a high pressure engine in combination with a low pressure condensing engine. The first steamboats powered only by high pressure were the ''Aetna'' and ''Pennsylvania'' designed and built by [[Oliver Evans]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=14\u201331}}</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1811 to 1812, the ''[[New Orleans (steamboat)|New Orleans]]'' became the first steamboat to travel down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. The commercial feasibility of steamboats on the Mississippi and its tributaries was demonstrated by the ''[[Enterprise (1814)|Enterprise]]'' in 1814.\n\nBy the time of Fulton's death in 1815 he operated 21 of the estimated 30 steamboats in the U.S. The number of steamboats steadily grew into the hundreds. There were more steamboats in the Mississippi valley than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=63\">{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=63}}</ref>\n\nEarly steamboats took 30 days to travel from New Orleans to Louisville, which was from half to one-quarter the time by keel boat. Due to improvements in steamboat technology, by 1830 the time from New Orleans to Louisville was halved. In 1820 freight rates for keel boats were five cents per ton-mile versus two cents by steamboat, falling to one-half cent per pound by 1830.<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/46 46]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/46\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[SS Savannah]] crossed from Savannah to Liverpool in 1819 as the first trans-Atlantic steamship; however, until the development of more efficient engines, trans-ocean ships had to carry more coal than freight. Early trans-ocean steamships were used for passengers and soon some companies began offering regularly scheduled service.\n\n====Railroads====\nRailroads were an English invention, and the first entrepreneurs imported British equipment in the 1830s. By the 1850s the Americans had developed their own technology. The early lines in the 1830s and 1840s were locally funded, and connected nearby cities or connected farms to navigable waterways. They primarily handled freight rather than passengers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Atack | Passell|1994|pp=429}}</ref> The first locomotives were imported from England. One such locomotive was the [[John Bull (locomotive)|John Bull]] which arrived in 1831. While awaiting assembly, [[Matthias W. Baldwin]], who had designed and manufactured a highly successful stationary steam engine, was able to inspect the parts and obtain measurements. Baldwin was already working on an experimental locomotive based on designs shown at the [[Rainhill Trials]] in England. Baldwin produced his first locomotive in 1832; he went on to found the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], one of the largest steam locomotive manufacturers. In 1833 when there were few locomotives in the U.S., three quarters were made in England. In 1838 there were 346 locomotives recorded in the U.S., three-fourths of which were made in the U.S.<ref>{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790\u20131865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/236 236]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/236\n}}\n</ref>\n\nOhio had more railroads built in the 1840s than any other state. Ohio's railroads put the canals out of business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=46}}</ref> A typical mile of railroad cost $30,000 compared to the $20,000 per mile of canal, but a railroad could carry 50 times as much traffic. Railroads appeared at the time of the canal boom, causing its abrupt end, although some canals flourished for an additional half-century.\n\n====Manufacturing====\nStarting with textiles in the 1790s, factories were built to supply a regional and national market. The power came from waterfalls, and most of the factories were built alongside the rivers in rural New England and upstate New York.<ref>Victor Clark, ''History of manufactures in the United States: 1607\u20131860.

In 1810 the secretary of the treasury estimated that two-thirds of rural household clothing, including hosiery and linen, was produced by households.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=51}}</ref> By the 1820s, housewives bought the cloth at local stores, and continued their sewing chores.<ref>David Montgomery, \"The Working Classes of the Pre-Industrial American City, 1780\u20131830,\" ''Labor History'' (1968) 9#1 pp 3\u201322, esp. p.4</ref> The American textile industry was established during the long period of wars from 1793 to 1815, when cheap cloth imports from Britain were unavailable. [[Samuel Slater]] secretly brought in the plans for complex textile machinery from Britain, and built new factories in Rhode Island using the stolen designs.<ref>Barbara M. Tucker, ''Samuel Slater and the origins of the American textile industry: 1790\u20131860'' (1984)</ref> By the time the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] cut off trade with Britain, there were 15 cotton spinning mills in operation. These were all small operations, typically employing fewer than 50 people, and most used [[Water frame|Arckwright water frames]] powered by small streams. They were all located in southeastern New England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=57\u20139}}</ref> In 1809 the number of mills had grown to 62, with 25 under construction. To meet increased demand for cloth several manufacturers resorted to the [[putting-out system]] of having the handloom weaving done in homes. The putting-out system was inefficient because of the difficulty of distributing the yarn and collecting the cloth, embezzlement of supplies, lack of supervision and poor quality. To overcome these problems the textile manufacturers began to consolidate work in central workshops shops where they could supervise operations. Taking this to the next level, in 1815 [[Francis Cabot Lowell (businessman)|Francis Cabot Lowell]] of the [[Boston Manufacturing Company]] built the first integrated spinning and weaving factory in the world at Waltham, Massachusetts, using plans for a power loom that he smuggled out of England. This was the largest factory in the U.S., with a workforce of about 300. It was a very efficient, highly profitable mill that, with the aid of the [[Tariff of 1816]], competed effectively with British textiles at a time when many smaller operations were being forced out of business.<ref>Kenton Beerman, \"The Beginning of a Revolution: Waltham and the Boston Manufacturing Company.\" ''The Concord Review'' (1994) [http://teachers.hfcsd.org/webpages/tnassivera/files/the%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution.pdf online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402135758/http://teachers.hfcsd.org/webpages/tnassivera/files/the%20beginning%20of%20a%20revolution.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Fall River Manufactory]], located on the [[Quequechan River]] in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]], was founded in 1813 by Dexter Wheeler and cousin David Anthony.

[[Honor\u00e9 Blanc]], who had served as inspector general of the three French arsenals, began producing muskets with interchangeable locks in France when [[Thomas Jefferson]] was minister to France. Jefferson wrote a letter to [[John Jay]] about these developments in 1785.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/> The idea of armament standardization was advocated by [[Louis de Tousard]], who fled the [[French Revolution]] and in 1795 joined the U.S. Corps of Artillerists and Engineers where he taught artillery and engineering he learned in France. At the suggestion of George Washington, Tousard had been working on an artillery manual, which he published as ''The American Artillerist's Companion'' (1809). Tousard's manual, which was a standard textbook for officer training, stressed the importance of  a system of standardized armaments.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nFears of war stemming from the [[XYZ Affair]] caused the U.S. to begin offering cash advance contracts for producing small arms to private individuals in 1798. Two notable recipients of these contracts associated with interchangeable parts were [[Eli Whitney]] and [[Simeon North]]. Although Whitney was not able to make interchangeable parts, he was a proponent of using machinery for gun making; however, he employed only the simplest machines in his factory. North eventually made progress toward some degree of interchangeability and developed special machinery. North's shop used the first known [[Milling (machining)|milling machine]] ({{circa|1816}}), a fundamental [[machine tool]].<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe experience of the War of 1812 led the War Department to issue a request for contract proposals for firearms with [[interchangeable parts]]. Previously, parts from each firearm had to be carefully custom fitted; almost all infantry regiments necessarily included an artificer or armorer who could perform this intricate gunsmithing. The requirement for interchangeable parts forced forward the development of modern metal-working machine tools, including [[Milling (machining)|milling machines]], grinders, shapers and [[Planer (metalworking)|planers]]. The Federal Armories perfected the use of machine tools by developing fixtures to correctly position the parts being machined and jigs to guide the cutting tools over the proper path. Systems of blocks and gauges were also developed to check the accuracy and precision of the machined parts. Developing the manufacturing techniques for making interchangeable parts by the Federal Armories took over two decades; however, the first interchangeable small arms parts were not made to a high degree of precision. It wasn't until mid century or later that parts for U.S. rifles and could be considered truly interchangeable with a degree of precision. In 1853 when the British Parliamentary Committee on Small Arms questioned gun maker [[Samuel Colt]], and machine tool makers [[James Nasmyth]] and [[Joseph Whitworth]], there was still some question about what constituted interchangeability and whether it could be achieved at a reasonable cost.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe machinists' skills were called armory practice and the system eventually became known as the [[American system of manufacturing]]. [[Machinist]]s from the armories eventually spread the technology to other industries, such as clocks and watches, especially in the New England area. It wasn't until late in the 19th century that interchangeable parts became widespread in U.S. manufacturing. Among the items using interchangeable parts were some sewing machine brands and bicycles.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>\n\nThe development of these modern machine tools and machining practices made possible the development of modern industry capable of mass production; however, large scale industrial production did not develop in the U.S. until the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\">{{Hounshell1984}}</ref><ref>Merritt Roe Smith, ''Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology: The Challenge of Change'' (1980)</ref><ref>David R.

The first was the result of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which shut off most international shipping and trade due to the [[Napoleonic Wars]].  The embargo caused a depression in cities and industries dependent on European trade. The other two downturns were depressions accompanied by significant periods of deflation during the early 19th century. The first and most severe was during the depression from 1818 to 1821 when prices of agricultural commodities declined by almost 50 percent. A credit contraction caused by a financial crisis in England drained specie out of the U.S. The Bank of the United States also contracted its lending. The price of agricultural commodities fell by almost 50 percent from the high in 1815 to the low in 1821, and did not recover until the late 1830s, although to a significantly lower price level. Most damaging was the price of cotton, the U.S.'s main export. Food crop prices, which had been high because of the famine of 1816 that was caused by the [[year without a summer]], fell after the return of normal harvests in 1818. Improved transportation, mainly from turnpikes, significantly lowered transportation costs.<ref name=\"Taylor 1951\">\n{{cite book\n|title=The Transportation Revolution, 1815\u20131860\n |last=Taylor\n |first= George Rogers\n|authorlink=\n|year=1951 |publisher = Rinehart & Co.\n|location=New York, Toronto\n|isbn= 978-0-87332-101-3|pages=133, 331\u20134}}\n</ref>\n\nThe third economic downturn was the depression of the late 1830s to 1843, following the [[Panic of 1837]], when the money supply in the United States contracted by about 34 percent with prices falling by 33 percent.

Branch mints at [[New Orleans Mint|New Orleans]]; [[Dahlonega Mint|Dahlonega]], Georgia; and [[Charlotte Mint|Charlotte]], North Carolina, were authorized by congress in 1835 and became operational in 1838.\n\nGold was being withdrawn from the U.S. by England and silver had also been taken out of the country because it had been under valued relative to gold by the [[Coinage Act of 1834]]. Canal projects began to fail. The result was the financial [[Panic of 1837]]. In 1838 there was a brief recovery. The business cycle upturn occurred in 1843.\n\nEconomic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era. For the most part, they follow the conclusions of [[Peter Temin]], who absolved Jackson's policies, and blamed international events beyond American control, such as conditions in Mexico, China and Britain. A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin's conclusion that \"the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis-a-vis the Second Bank of the U.S.\"<ref>Robert Whaples, \"Were Andrew Jackson's Policies 'Good for the Economy'?\" ''Independent Review'' (2014) 18#4 [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-362727309/were-andrew-jackson-s-policies-good-for-the-economy online]</ref>\n\n====Economics of the War of 1812====\nThe War of 1812 was financed by borrowing, by new issues of private bank notes and by an inflation in prices of 15%. The government was a very poor manager during the war, with delays in payments and confusion, as the Treasury took in money months after it was scheduled to pay it out.  Inexperience, indecision, incompetence, partisanship and confusion the main hallmarks. The federal government's management system was designed to minimize the federal role before 1812. The Republicans in power deliberately wanted to downsize the power and roles of the federal government; when the war began, the Federalist opposition worked hard to sabotage operations. Problems multiplied rapidly in 1812, and all the weaknesses were magnified, especially regarding the Army and the Treasury.  There were no serious reforms before the war ended.<ref>Leonard D. White, ''The Jeffersonians: A Study in Administrative History 1801 1829'' (1951) pp 118\u201319, 146, 216\u201337, 285, 419, 554</ref> In financial matters, the decentralizing ideology of the Republicans meant they wanted the [[First Bank of the United States]] to expire in 1811, when its 20-year charter ran out. Its absence made it much more difficult to handle the financing of the war, and cause special problems in terms of moving money from state to state, since state banks were not allowed to operate across state lines.  The bureaucracy was terrible, often missing deadlines.  On the positive side, over 120 new state banks were created all over the country, and they issued notes that financed much of the war effort, along with loans raised by Washington.  Some key Republicans, especially Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] realized the need for new taxes, but the Republican Congress was very reluctant and only raised small amounts.  The whole time, the Federalists in Congress and especially the Federalist-controlled state governments in the Northeast, and the Federalist-aligned financial system in the Northeast, was strongly opposed to the war and refused to help in the financing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Spencer Tucker et al. eds.|title=The Encyclopedia of the War of 1812: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hVSrJBQYAk8C&pg=PA16|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|pages=16\u201317|isbn=9781851099566}}.</ref>  Indeed, they facilitated smuggling across the Canadian border, and sent large amounts of gold and silver to Canada, which created serious shortages of specie in the US.<ref>Tucker, ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=hVSrJBQYAk8C&pg=PA210 p. 210]</ref>\n\nAcross the two and half years of the war, 1812\u20131815, the federal government took in more money than it spent.

The population of the West (generally meaning from Ohio to and including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri and south to include Kentucky) grew rapidly. The West was primarily a grain and pork producing region, with an important machine tool industry developing around Cincinnati, Ohio. The Southern economy was based on plantation agriculture, primarily cotton, tobacco and sugar, produced with slave labor.\n\nThe market economy and factory system were not typical before 1850, but developed along transportation routes. Steamboats and railroads, introduced in the early part of the century, became widespread and aided westward expansion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|1969|pp=215}}</ref> The telegraph was introduced in 1844 and was in widespread use by the mid 1850s.\n\nA machine tool industry developed and machinery became a major industry.

Hot blast is a method of using heat from the blast furnace exhaust gas to preheat combustion air, saving a considerable amount of fuel. It allowed much higher furnace temperatures and increased the capacity of furnaces.\n\nHot blast allowed blast furnaces to use [[anthracite]] or lower grade coal. Anthracite was difficult to light with cold blast. High quality metallurgical coking coal deposits of sufficient size for iron making were only available in Great Britain and western Germany in the 19th century,<ref>{{Harvnb|Landes|1969|pp=88}}</ref> but with less fuel required per unit of iron, it was possible to use lower grade coal.\n\nThe use of anthracite was rather short lived because the size of blast furnaces increased enormously toward the end of the century, forcing the use of [[coke (fuel)|coke]], which was more porous and did not impede the upflow of the gases through the furnace. Charcoal would have been crushed by the column of material in tall furnaces. Also, the capacity of furnaces would have eventually exceeded the wood supply, as happened with locomotives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=40\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIron was used for a wide variety of purposes. In 1860 large consumers were numerous types of castings, especially stoves. Of the $32 million of bar, sheet and railroad iron produced, slightly less than half was railroad iron. The value added by stoves was equal to the value added by rails.<ref name=\"North 1966 pp\">{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=}}</ref>\n\n====Coal displaces wood====\nCoal displaced wood during the mid-nineteenth century. In 1840 wood was the major fuel while coal production was minor. In 1850 wood was 90% of fuel consumption and 90% of that was for home heating. By 1880 wood was only 5% of fuel consumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=415}}</ref> Cast iron stoves for heating and cooking displaced inefficient fireplaces.  Wood was a byproduct of land clearing and was placed along the banks of rivers for steamboats. By mid century the forests were being depleted while steamboats and locomotives were using enough wood to create shortages along their routes; however, railroads, canals and navigable internal waterways were able to bring coal to market at a price far below the cost of wood. Coal sold in Cincinnati for 10 cents per bushel (94 pounds) and in New Orleans for 14 cents.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=403\u201321}}</ref>\n\nCharcoal production was very labor and land intensive. It was estimated that to fuel a typical sized 100 ton of pig iron per week furnace in 1833 at a sustained yield, a timber plantation of 20,000 acres was required. The trees had to be hauled by oxen to where they were cut, stacked on end and covered with earth or put in a kiln to be charred for about a week. Anthracite reduced labor cost to $2.50 per ton compared to charcoal at $15.50 per ton.<ref>{{cite book\n|title= American Iron 1607\u20131900\n |last=Gordon\n |first= Robert B\n|authorlink=\n|year=1996 |publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press\n|location=Baltimore and London\n|isbn= 978-0-8018-6816-0 |pages=45, 48\u201353 |url= }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=400}}</ref>\n\n====Manufacturing====\nManufacturing became well established during the mid 19th century.

Sewing machines were developed for sewing leather. A leather rolling machine eliminated hand hammering, and was thirty times faster.

According to the 1838 report there were an estimated 2,000 engines totaling 40,000&nbsp;hp, of which 64% were used in transportation, mostly in steamboats.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=69, 73}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Corliss steam engine]], patented in 1848, was called the most significant development in steam engineering since [[Watt steam engine|James Watt]]. The Corliss engine was more efficient than previous engines and maintained more uniform speed in response to load changes, making it suitable for a wide variety of industrial applications. It was the first steam engine that was suitable for cotton spinning. Previously steam engines for cotton spinning pumped water to a water wheel that powered the machinery.\n\nSteam power greatly expanded during the late 19th century with the rise of large factories, the expanded railroad network and early electric lighting and electric street railways.\n\n====Steamboats and ships====\nThe number of steamboats on western rivers in the U.S. grew from 187 in 1830 to 735 in 1860. Total registered tonnage of steam vessels for the U.S. grew from 63,052 in 1830 to 770,641 in 1860.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hunter|1985|pp=30}}</ref>\n\nUntil the introduction of iron ships, the U.

Iron ships became common and more efficient multiple expansion engines were developed. After the introduction of iron ships, Britain became the leading shipbuilding country. The U.S. tried to compete by building wooden [[Clipper|clipper ships]], which were fast, but too narrow to carry economic volumes of low value freight.\n\n====Telegraph====\nCongress approved funds for a short demonstration [[Electrical telegraph|telegraph]] [[Baltimore\u2013Washington telegraph line|line from Baltimore to Washington D.C.]], which was operational in 1844. The telegraph was quickly adopted by the railroad industry, which needed rapid communication to coordinate train schedules, the importance of which had been highlighted by a collision on the Western Railroad in 1841. Railroads also needed to communicate over a vast network in order to keep track of freight and equipment.<ref name=\"Chandler 1993 pp\">{{Harvnb|Chandler|1993|pp=}}</ref> Consequently, railroads installed telegraphs lines on their existing [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-ways]].

Urbanized industry was limited primarily to the Northeast; cotton cloth production was the leading industry, with the manufacture of shoes, woolen clothing, and machinery also expanding. Most of the workers in the new factories were immigrants or their children. Between 1845 and 1855, some 300,000 European immigrants arrived annually. Many remained in eastern cities, especially mill towns and mining camps, while those with farm experience and some savings bought farms in the West.<ref name=\"Walter Licht 1995\">Walter Licht, ''Industrializing America: The Nineteenth Century'' (1995)</ref>\n\n====Agriculture====\n[[File:Batteuse 1881.jpg|thumb|Threshing machine from 1881.

The Second Bank of the U.S. had also maintained some control over other banks, but in its absence banks were only under state regulation.<ref name=\"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nOne of the main problems with banks was over-issuance of [[banknotes]]. These were redeemable in specie (gold or silver) upon presentation to the chief cashier of the bank.<ref name=\"Atack & Passell 1994 469\"/> When people lost trust in a bank they rushed to redeem its notes, and because banks issued more notes than their specie reserves, the bank couldn't redeem the notes, often causing the bank to fail. In 1860 there were over 8,000 state chartered banks issuing notes. In 1861 the U.S. began issuing United States Notes as legal tender.<ref name=\"Fed_News_2013\">{{cite web\n |url         = https://www.frbservices.org/fedfocus/archive_fedcash/fedcash_0413_01.html?elq=76f341601598453f8ec4655651ea9a4a\n |title       = A Brief History of U.S. Paper Currency\n |author      = Federal Reserve Banks\n |date        = April 2013\n |publisher   = Federal Reserve Banks\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151016025106/https://www.frbservices.org/fedfocus/archive_fedcash/fedcash_0413_01.html?elq=76f341601598453f8ec4655651ea9a4a\n |archivedate = 2015-10-16\n}}</ref>\n\nBanks began paying interest on deposits and using the proceeds to make short term ''call loans'', mainly to stock brokers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Huston|1986|pp=}}</ref>\n\nNew York banks created a [[Bankers' clearing house|clearing house]] association in 1853 in which member banks cleared accounts with other city banks at the close of the week.

The association was able to detect banks that were issuing excessive notes because they could not settle.<ref>{{Harvnb|Huston|1986|pp=3}}</ref>\n\n====Panic of 1857====\nThe recovery from the depression that followed the [[Panic of 1837]] began in 1843 and lasted until the [[Panic of 1857]].\n\nThe panic was triggered by the August 24 failure of the well regarded Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co. A manager in the New York branch, one of the city's largest financial institutions, had embezzled funds and made excessive loans. The company's president announced suspension of specie redemption, which triggered a rush to redeem banknotes, causing many banks to fail because of lack of specie.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe United States had been running a trade deficit, draining gold out of the country. Because of the tariff revenues, the U.S. Treasury held a considerable amount of gold, which kept it out of circulation. On September 12, the [[SS Central America]], which was carrying $1.5 million in gold from California, sank, contributing to the panic. Secretary of the Treasury Howell Cobb came to the aid of New York mercantile interests by buying back some of the national debt. On September 25 the Bank of Pennsylvania suspended specie payment, starting a nationwide bank run.<ref name=\"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe danger of interest bearing deposits became apparent when bankers had to call loans made to stock brokers, many of whom were unable to pay. Banks then had to curtail credit to commercial and industrial customers. Many business were unable to pay workers back wages because they held so many worthless banknotes.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe [[Crimean War]], which had cut off Russian wheat exports, ended in 1856. The war had caused high wheat prices and overexpansion in the U.S., which had been exporting wheat to Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=209}}</ref> Bountiful western harvests in 1857 caused grain prices to fall. Good harvests in England, France and Russia caused collapse in demand for U.S. grains in 1858 and 1859. This caused railroad shipments from the West to fall, which resulted in the bankruptcy of some railroads.<ref name= \"Huston-1986\"/>\n\nThe inability of the West to sell its crops hurt businesses in other regions, such as New England, which manufactured shoes sold in the West.

The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit. With the South gone and Northern Democrats weak, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for most of the rest. Economic historians attribute the remainder of the cost of the war to inflation. Congress wrote an elaborate program of economic [[modernization]] that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy.<ref>Heather Cox Richardson, ''The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies during the Civil War'' (1997)</ref> For a list of the major industrialists see .\n\n=====Financing the war=====\n\nIn 1860 the Treasury was a small operation that funded the small-scale operations of the government through land sales and customs based on a low tariff.<ref>Jane Flaherty, \"'The Exhausted Condition of the Treasury' on the Eve of the Civil War,\" ''Civil War History'', (2009) 55#2 pp. 244\u2013277 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/civil_war_history/v055/55.2.flaherty.html in Project MUSE]</ref> Peacetime revenues were trivial in comparison with the cost of a full-scale war but the Treasury Department under Secretary [[Salmon P.

The government paid for supplies in real money, which encouraged people to sell to the government regardless of their politics.

Second came much higher tariffs, through several [[Morrill tariff]] laws. Third came the nation's first income tax; only the wealthy paid and it was repealed at war's end.\n[[File:Demand Legal comparison.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|1862 Greenbacks]]\n\nApart from taxes, the second major source of income was government bonds. For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Third, the government printed paper money called \"[[United States Note|greenbacks]]\".

Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.<ref>Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref>\n\n======Tariffs======\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1890520|title = A Political Response to Industrialism: The Republican Embrace of Protectionist Labor Doctrines|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 70|issue = 1|pages = 35\u201357|last1 = Huston|first1 = James L.|year = 1983|doi = 10.2307/1890520}}</ref>\n\nCustoms revenue from tariffs totaled $345&nbsp;million from 1861 through 1865 or 43% of all federal tax revenue.\n\n=====Land grants=====\n\nThe U.S. government owned vast amounts of good land (mostly from the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the Oregon Treaty with Britain in 1846). The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt. Land grants went to railroad construction companies to open up the western plains and link up to California. Together with the free lands provided farmers by the Homestead Law the low-cost farm lands provided by the land grants sped up the expansion of commercial agriculture in the West.\n\nThe 1862 Homestead Act opened up the public domain lands for free. Land grants to the railroads meant they could sell tracts for family farms (80 to 200 acres) at low prices with extended credit.

During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] railroad construction was heavily subsidized (with much corruption), but the region maintained its dependence on cotton. Former slaves became wage laborers, [[tenant farmer]]s, or [[sharecropper]]s. They were joined by many poor whites, as the population grew faster than the economy. As late as 1940 the only significant manufacturing industries were textile mills (mostly in the upland Carolinas) and some steel in Alabama.<ref>Gavin Wright, ''Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy since the Civil War'' (1986).</ref><ref>Roger Ransom, ''Conflict and Compromise: The Political Economy of Slavery, Emancipation and the American Civil War'' (1989)</ref>\n\nThe industrial advantages of the North over the South helped secure a Northern victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865). The Northern victory sealed the destiny of the nation and its economic system. The slave-labor system was abolished; sharecropping emerged and replaced slavery to supply the labor needed for cotton production, but cotton prices plunged during the Depression of 1873, leading Southern plantations to decline in profitability. Northern industry, which had expanded rapidly before and during the war, surged ahead.

Overall the Northern financial system was highly successful in raising money and turning patriotism into profit, while the Confederate system impoverished its patriots.<ref>Jane Flaherty, ''The revenue imperative'' (2009)</ref>\n\nThe United States needed $3.1 billion to pay for the immense armies and fleets raised to fight the Civil War \u2014 over $400&nbsp;million just in 1862.<ref>Jerry W.

For the first time bonds in small denominations were sold directly to the people, with publicity and patriotism as key factors, as designed by banker [[Jay Cooke]]. State banks lost their power to issue banknotes. Only national banks could do that, and Chase made it easy to become a national bank; it involved buying and holding federal bonds and financiers rushed to open these banks. Chase numbered them, so that the first one in each city was the \"First National Bank\".<ref>Bray Hammond, ''Sovereignty and the Empty Purse: Banks and Politics in the Civil War'' (1970).</ref> Fourth the government printed \"greenbacks\"\u2014paper money\u2014which were controversial because they caused inflation.\n\nSecretary Chase, though a long-time free-trader, worked with Congressman Justin Morrill to pass a second tariff bill in summer 1861, raising rates another 10&nbsp;points in order to generate more revenues.<ref>Richardson, 100, 113</ref> These subsequent bills were primarily revenue driven to meet the war's needs, though they enjoyed the support of protectionists such as Carey, who again assisted Morrill in the bill's drafting. The [[Morrill Tariff]] of 1861 was designed to raise revenue. The tariff act of 1862 served not only to raise revenue, but also to encourage the establishment of factories free from British competition by taxing British imports. Furthermore, it protected American factory workers from low paid European workers, and as a major bonus attracted tens of thousands of those Europeans to immigrate to America for high wage factory and craftsman jobs.<ref>James L.

The challenge was to make the land useful to people and to provide the economic basis for the wealth that would pay off the war debt.  The government did this by breaking it up into smaller plots for private ownership, through various federal laws.\n\nBounty-land warrants were issued to military veterans in the United States from 1775 to 1855.  The land grants were used extensively for settlement of pre-Louisiana Purchase lands east of the Mississippi River, including the [[Ohio Country]], the [[Northwest Territory]], and the [[Platte Purchase]] in Missouri.<ref>https://www.archives.gov/research/military/bounty-land-1775-1855.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=1165 | title=U.S. War Bounty Land Warrants, 1789-1858}}</ref>\n\nAbout 180 million acres were granted to railroad construction companies between 1850 and 1871.<ref name=\"gfeldmeth\">http://faculty.polytechnic.org/gfeldmeth/chart.land.pdf</ref>  The [[Land Grant Act of 1850]] provided for 3.75 million acres of land to the states to support railroad projects; by 1857 21 million acres of public lands were used for railroads in the [[Mississippi River]] valley, and the stage was set for more substantial Congressional subsidies to future railroads.<ref>Julian E. Zelizer, ''The American Congress: the building of democracy'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=_MGEIIwT5pUC&pg=PA288& p.288]</ref>\n\nThe [[Pacific Railroad Acts]] financed several [[transcontinental railroad]]s by granting land directly to corporations for the first time.  In addition to operating revenues, railroads were able to finance networks crossing vast distances by selling granted property adjacent to the tracks; these would become highly desirable plots for new settlers and businesses because of the easy access to long-distance transportation.\n\n[[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] starting in 1860 benefited colleges and universities.\n\nVarious [[Homestead Acts]] distributed land nearly for free in return for improvements such as building a house, farming, or planting trees. \nBetween 1862 and 1934, the federal government granted 1.6 million homesteads and distributed {{convert|270000000|acre|mi2}} of federal land for private ownership. This was a total of 10% of all land in the United States.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/homestead-act/ ''The Homestead Act of 1862'']; Archives.gov</ref>  Eligibility for the last such program, in Alaska, ended in 1986.<ref>US Department of the Interior, National Park Service.

Land grants creating the [[Indian Reservation]] system were used by the [[Indian Appropriations Act]] of 1851 to segregate native tribes, but later acts opened some of that land to white settlement, notably including a [[land run]] opening the [[Unassigned Lands]] in Oklahoma. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 pressured Native Americans to [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilate to European-American culture]], offering former tribal land to individuals separating from their tribes and putting \"surplus\" reservation land up for auction.  Overall, about half of Indian Reservation land was sold to white Americans by 1906, about 75 million acres.<ref name=\"gfeldmeth\" />\n\n{{further|Land grant#United_States}}\n\n====Banking====\nThe North's most important war measure was perhaps the creation of a system of national banks that provided a sound currency for the industrial expansion. Even more important, the hundreds of new banks that were allowed to open were required to purchase government bonds. Thereby the nation monetized the potential wealth represented by farms, urban buildings, factories, and businesses, and immediately turned that money over to the Treasury for war needs.\n\n====Education====\nBritish Parliamentary Committee members [[Joseph Whitworth]] and [[George Wallis]] were very impressed at the educational level of workers in the U.S., commenting that \"...{{nbsp}}so that everybody reads ... and intelligence penetrates through the lowest grades of society.\"  They also remarked that most states had compulsory education laws requiring a minimum of three months per year schooling for child factory workers.<ref>{{Harvnb|North|1966|pp=174}}''The Industry of the United States in Machinery, Manufactures and Useful and Applied Arts'', compiled from the Official Reports of Messrs Whitworth and Wallis, London, 1854.</ref>\n\n====Civil War====\nThe [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] grew rich fighting the war, as the Confederate economy was destroyed.<ref>Emerson David  Fite, ''Social and industrial conditions in the North during the Civil War'' (1910) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wI0-AAAAYAAJ  online edition]</ref> The [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] in control in Washington had a Whig vision of an industrial nation, with great cities, efficient factories, productive farms, national banks, and high-speed rail links. The South had resisted policies such as tariffs to promote industry and homestead laws to promote farming because slavery would not benefit; with the South gone, and Northern Democrats very weak in Congress, the Republicans enacted their legislation. At the same time they passed new taxes to pay for part of the war, and issued large amounts of bonds to pay for the most of the rest. (The remainder can be charged to inflation.) They wrote an elaborate program of economic modernization that had the dual purpose of winning the war and permanently transforming the economy. The key policy-maker in Congress was [[Thaddeus Stevens]], as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]]. He took charge of major legislation that funded the war effort and revolutionized the nation's economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants.<ref>{{cite book|author=Heather Cox Richardson|title=The Greatest Nation of the Earth: Republican Economic Policies During the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZVjReDrxKYC&pg=PA9|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=9, 41, 52, 111, 116, 120, 182, 202|isbn=9780674059658}}</ref>\n\nHistorians have debated whether or not the Civil War sped up the rate of economic growth in the face of destruction throughout the South and the diversion of resources to military supplies and away from civilian goods.

Wholesale prices had more than doubled, and reduction of inflation was a priority for Secretary of the Treasury [[Hugh McCulloch]].<ref>Herbert S.

The old paper currency issued by state banks had been withdrawn, and Confederate currency was worthless. The national banks had issued $207 million in currency, which was backed by gold and silver. The federal treasury had issued $428 million in greenbacks, which was legal tender but not backed by gold or silver. In addition about $275 million of coin was in circulation. The new administration policy announced in October would be to make all the paper convertible into specie, if Congress so voted. The House of Representatives passed the Alley Resolution on December 18, 1865 by vote of 144 to 6. In the Senate it was a different matter, for the key player was Senator [[John Sherman]], who said that inflation contraction was not nearly as important as refunding the short-term and long-term national debt. the war had been largely financed by national debt, in addition to taxation and inflation. The national debt stood at $2.8 billion. By October 1865, most of it in short term and temporary loans.<ref>For an econometric approach see Lee E. Ohanian, ''The Macroeconomic Effects of War Finance in the United States: Taxes, Inflation, and Deficit Finance'' (Routledge, 2018).</ref> Wall Street bankers typified by [[Jay Cooke]] believe that the economy was about to grow rapidly, thanks to the development of agriculture through the Homestead Act, the expansion of railroads, especially rebuilding the devastated Southern railroads and n opening the transcontinental line to the West Coast, and especially the flourishing of manufacturing during the war. The goal premium over greenbacks was hundred and $145 in greenbacks to  $100 in gold, and the optimists thought that they heavy demand for currency in an era of prosperity would return the ratio to 100.<ref>Schell, 1930.</ref> A compromise was reached in April 1866, that limited the treasury to a currency contraction of only $10 million over six months. Meanwhile, the Senate refunded the entire national debt, but the House failed to act. By early 1867, postwar prosperity was a reality, and the optimists wanted an end to contraction, which Congress ordered in January 1868. Meanwhile, the Treasury issued new bonds at a lower interest rate to refinance the redemption of short-term debt. while the old state bank notes were disappearing from circulation, new national bank notes, backed by species, were expanding.

The [[Bessemer process]] was the first large scale process for producing steel, which it was able to do at low cost.  The first U.S. licensed Bessemer plant began operation in 1865. Bessemer steel was used mostly for rails.  Due to difficulty in controlling quality and embrittlement with aging, Bessemer steel was not suitable for structural purposes.\n\nThe Siemens-Martin process, or [[open hearth furnace|open hearth process]], produced a suitable grade structural steel. Open hearth steel displaced wrought iron as a structural material in the 1880s.  Open hearth steel began being used in a wide variety of applications including high rise buildings, ships, machinery, pipelines, rails and bridges.\n\n====Electric lights and electric street railways====\n{{Main|Electrification}}\nEarly electrification was too limited to have a big impact on the late 19th century economy. Electricity was also very expensive because of the low conversion efficiency of fuel to power, the small scale of power plants and the fact that most utilities offered only nighttime service. Daytime service became common during the early 20th century after the introduction of the [[AC motor]], which tended to be used more during the day, balancing the load. Until that time a large share of power was self-generated by the user, such as a factory, hotel or electric street railway ([[tram]] or streetcar).<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant 1991\">\n{{cite book |title      = A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power\n |last1      = Hunter\n |first1     = Louis C.\n |last2      = Bryant\n |first2     = Lynwood\n |year       = 1991\n |publisher  = MIT Press\n |location   = Cambridge, Massachusetts, London\n |isbn       = 978-0-262-08198-6\n |page       = \n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/historyofindustr00hunt\n}}\n</ref>\n\nElectric street railways were introduced in the U.S. in 1888 when [[Frank J.

The wheat farmers enjoyed abundant output and good years from 1876 to 1881 when bad European harvests kept the world price high. They then suffered from a slump in the 1880s when conditions in Europe improved. The farther west the settlers went, the more dependent they became on the monopolistic railroads to move their goods to market, and the more inclined they were to protest, as in the Populist movement of the 1890s. Wheat farmers blamed local [[grain elevator]] owners (who purchased their crop), railroads and eastern bankers for the low prices.<ref name=\"Elwyn B. Robinson 1982 p 203\">Elwyn B.

The Granges focused initially on social activities to counter the isolation most farm families experienced. Women's participation was actively encouraged. Spurred by the Panic of 1873, the Grange soon grew to 20,000 chapters and 1.5 million members. The Granges set up their own marketing systems, stores, processing plants, factories and [[cooperative]]s. Most went bankrupt. The movement also enjoyed some political success during the 1870s. A few Midwestern states passed \"[[Granger Laws]]\", limiting railroad and warehouse fees.<ref name=\"D. Sven Nordin 1974\">D. Sven Nordin, ''Rich Harvest: A History of the Grange, 1867\u20131900'' (1974)</ref>\n\nFederal land grants helped each state create an agricultural college and a network of extension agents who demonstrated modern techniques to farmers. Wheat and cotton farmers in the 1890s supported the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] movement, but failed in their demands for free silver and inflation. Instead the 1896 election committed the nation to the gold standard and a program of sustained industrialization. Farmers in the Midwest and East gave verbal support to the Populists. They focused on the nearby urban markets, rather than on highly fluctuating European markets for weaving cotton.\n\n====Oil, minerals and mining====\n=====Oil=====\n{{Details|Standard Oil}}\n[[File:John D. Rockefeller 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John D. Rockefeller]]]]\nIn the 1850s an advance in lighting was the use of kerosene lamps with glass chimneys, which produced a good quality light at a relatively affordable price.  Kerosene lighting effectively extended the day and made it easier to read at night.  An industry developed to produce [[coal oil]], as kerosene was then called.<ref name=\"Yergin\">{{cite book |title=The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power |last=Yergin |first= Daniel |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-4391-1012-6 |pages= |url=}}</ref>  Kerosene was also being distilled from Pennsylvania crude oil by [[Samuel Kier]].\n\n[[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]] paid a visit [[Dartmouth College]], which he had attended, and saw a sample of \"rock oil\" from Pennsylvania. Suspecting that the oil may have potential as an illuminant and lubricant, he organized an investor group.  In 1853 Bissell's group, which became the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co., hired Yale chemistry professor [[Benjamin Silliman, Jr.]] to perform an analysis of \"rock oil\". Silliman's report of April 1864 stated that \"rock oil\" could yield an excellent illuminating oil.  However, there was no economical means for producing sufficient commercial quantities of oil.  Bissell had a chance insight when he saw a picture of oil derricks used to produce an oil based patent medicine obtained as a byproduct of a brine well.<ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\nFollowing a shareholder disagreement, Bissell and fellow investor [[Jonathan Greenleaf Eveleth|Jonathan Eveleth]] investor split with Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. and formed Seneca Oil in 1858.  [[Edwin Drake]], a shareholder, was hired by the company to drill for oil.  The site chosen to drill the well was on Oil Creek near Titusville, PA, where a water well was producing oil.  Drake chose to use brine well drilling technology based on the technique used in China since ancient times that reached the West in the late 1820s, except that Drake used iron cable, an iron well casing and a steam engine.  The [[Drake Well]] hit oil at a depth of 69.55 feet on August 27, 1858, starting a drilling  boom in the region.<ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\nAmong the numerous refineries that were started were several along a new rail link to Cleveland, Ohio, where [[John D. Rockefeller]] and his partner Maurice Clark owned a grocery produce shipping business.  Rockefeller and Clark also got in the refining business, and in 1865 the partners decided to hold a private auction between the two, with Rockefeller being the successful bidder.  The refining industry was intensely competitive, and by 1869 there was three times the capacity needed, a situation which lasted many years, with the number of refineries reaching 6000.\n\nIn 1870 John D. Rockefeller, his brother [[William Rockefeller]], [[Henry Flagler]], [[Oliver Burr Jennings]] and silent partner [[Stephen V. Harkness]] formed [[Standard Oil]].  John D. Rockefeller was the master planner and organizer of the systematic plan to form combinations with or acquire competitors and enter all phases of the oil industry from production to transportation, refining and distribution, a concept called [[vertical integration]]. Standard Oil sought every possible advantage over its competitors.  One method was using Standard's high shipping volume to secure discounts and drawbacks (payments from railroads for transporting competitors products) from railroads.  By 1879 Standard oil controlled 90% of U.S. refining capacity.  Producers in the Pennsylvania oil region tried to counter Standard Oil's transportation arrangements buy building the first long distance pipeline, the 110 mile long Tidewater Pipeline to Williamsport, Pennsylvania, which was on the Reading Railroad.  Standard Oil fought back by building four pipelines of its own.  Standard continued to monopolize the oil industry in the U.S. until it was broken up by the 1911 supreme court case [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]].\n\nEfficient gas mantles and electric lighting were eroding the illuminating oil market beginning in the 1880s; however a previously low value byproduct of refining was gasoline, which more than offset the role of kerosene in the early 20th century.<ref name= \"Nye 1990\"/><ref name=\"Yergin\"/>\n\n=====Coal=====\nCoal was found in abundance in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from Pennsylvania south to [[Kentucky]].\n\n=====Iron ore=====\nLarge iron ore mines opened in the [[Lake Superior]] region of the upper Midwest.

However, a sharp break in the growth rate to around 2.8% occurred from 1910 to 1929. Economists are uncertain what combination of supply and demand factors caused the break, but productivity growth was strong, enabling the labor cost per unit of output to decline from 1910 to 1929. The growth rate in hours worked fell 57% compared to the decline in the growth rate of output of 27%.  It is generally accepted that the new technologies and more efficient business methods permanently shifted the supply and demand relationship for labor, with labor being in surplus (except during both world wars when the economy was engaged in war-time production and millions of men served in the armed forces).  The technologies that became widespread after 1910, such as electrification, internal powered transportation and mass production, were capital saving. Total non-residential fixed business fell after 1910 due to the fall of investment in structures.<ref>{{ Cite journal\n| last1 = Vatter\n| last2 = Walker\n| last3 =Alperovitz\n| first1 = Harold G.\n| first2 = John F.\n| first3 =Gar\n| title = The onset and persistence of secular stagnation in the U.S. economy: 1910\u20131990, Journal of Economic Issues\n| year = 2005\n| url = \n}}</ref>\n\n===Industry, commerce and agriculture===\n{{Details|Causes of the Great Depression#Specific theories of cause#Productivity shock}}\nTwo of the most transformative technologies of the century were widely introduced during the early decades: [[electrification]], powered by high pressure boilers and [[steam turbine]]s and automobiles and trucks powered by the [[internal combustion engine]].<ref name=\"Godron_2016\" /><ref name=\"Constable_2003\">{{cite book |title=A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives\n|last=Constable |first=George\n|authorlink= |author2=Somerville, Bob  |publisher=Joseph Henry Press|location= |isbn= 978-0309089081 |pages= |url=|date=2003-01-01 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book |title=Transforming the Twentieth Century: Technical Innovations and Their Consequences\n|last=Smil |first=Vaclav|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|location=Oxford, New York\n|isbn= 9780195168754|page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_kRDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=%22United%20States%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\nChain stores experienced rapid growth.<ref name=\"Jerome 1934\"/>\n\nStandardization was urged by Dept. of Commerce for consumer goods such as bedspreads and screws.

Electric motors that were used in daytime, such as the [[DC motor]]s that powered street railways, helped balance the load, and many street railways generated their own electricity and also operated as electric utilities.  The [[AC motor]], developed in the 1890s, was ideal for industrial and commercial power and greatly increased the demand for electricity, particular during daytime.<ref name=\"Hunter&Bryant\">{{cite book\n|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 3: The Transmission of Power\n|last1=Hunter\n|first1=Louis C.\n|last2=Bryant\n|first2=Lynwood\n|year=1991\n|publisher=MIT Press\n|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts\n|isbn=978-0-262-08198-6\n|page=\n|url-access=registration\n|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofindustr00hunt\n}}</ref>\n\nElectrification in the U.S. started in industry around 1900, and by 1930 about 80% of power used in industry was electric.

By 1940 almost all urban households had electricity. Electrical appliances such as irons, cooking appliances and washing machines were slowly adopted by households.

Many large central power stations, equipped with high pressure boilers and steam turbine generators began being built after 1913. These central stations were designed for efficient handling of coal from the layout of the rail yards to the conveyor systems.  They were also much more fuel efficient, lowering the amount of fuel per kilowatt-hour of electricity to a small fraction of what it had been.

Ford Motor used every practical means to reduce the effort and movement of workers in order to reduce the time involved in making parts, moving parts and assembling parts into automobiles. Ford used electric powered factories and in 1913 Ford introduced the [[assembly line]], a step in the process that became known as ''[[mass production]]''.<ref name=\"Hounshell1984\"/>  The price of a [[Ford Model T]] fell from $900 in 1908\u20139 to $360 in 1916, despite the fact that wages doubled to $5 per day in 1914.

Important examples include aluminum made by the Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process and chlorine and caustic (sodium and potassium compounds). Chlorine and caustic had been produced by chemical processes but producing aluminum this way was prohibitively expensive. A large plant using Hall\u2013H\u00e9roult process was opened in Pittsburgh, USA in 1888 and others opened around the world. Falling electricity prices in the early 20th century greatly lowered the cost of making electrochemicals. There was high demand for aluminum for aircraft during World War I and afterward for commercial aviation.\n\nSome other electrochemicals are chromium, manganese and tungsten.\n\nChlorine began being used for treating household water to kill microorganisms.\n\n====Railroads====\n{{Main|Rail transportation in the United States}}\nAt the beginning of the 20th century the railroad network had over-expanded with many miles of unprofitable routes. In 1906 Congress gave the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate freight rates and the industry was unable to increase revenue enough to cover rising costs. By 1916, the peak year of track mileage, one-sixth of the nations railroad trackage was in bankruptcy.\n\nThe railroads proved inadequate to the increased freight volume created by [[World War I]]. There were major traffic jams in the system and critical supplies were experiencing delays. In December 1917 the railroads were taken over by the government and put under control of the [[United States Railroad Administration]] (USRA). The USRA ordered 1,930 new standardized steam locomotives and over 100,000 railcars.

The rate of decline was most rapid in 1950s\u20131960s, the reason for this was because of the increased innovation in farms where new technology was able to create more product which resulted in the need for fewer farms. Also during the 1950s\u20131960s people moved from the bigger cities and farms to more suburban areas so these smaller farms would be sold and people would move closer to cities. People also could not afford the new technologies to help them farm so bigger farms would be very successful during this time, while smaller farms would close.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://eh.net/encyclopedia/u-s-agriculture-in-the-twentieth-century/ | title=U.S. Agriculture in the Twentieth Century}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\n=====Telephone=====\nBefore 1900 telephones were used primarily by businesses.

The triode [[vacuum tube]] made it possible to build amplifiers for broadcasting and for receivers. Radio circuit design also advanced, allowing better signals with less noise. By the early 1920s radios began being mass-produced and commercial broadcast stations were set up around the country.\n\n====Finance, money and banking====\n{{main|Wall Street#History}}\nA major economic downturn in 1906 ended the expansion from the late 1890s.

The stock market had its best year in history in 1916. The U.S. gold reserves doubled between 1913 and 1918, causing the price level to rise. Interest rates had been held low to minimize interest on war bonds, but after the final war bonds were sold in 1919, the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate from 4% to 6%. Interest rates rose and the money supply contracted. The economy entered the [[Depression of 1920-21]], which was a sharp decline financially. By 1923, the economy had returned to full employment.<ref>{{cite book|title= Rethinking the Great Depression|last=Smiley|first=Gene |year= 2002|publisher =Ivan R.

Another such act passed the same year was the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]].  The new laws helped the large packers, and hurt small operations that lacked economy of scale or quality controls.<ref>Roger Roots,  \"A Muckraker's Aftermath: The Jungle of Meat-Packing Regulation After a Century.\" ''William  Mitchell Law Review''  27 (2000): 2413+  [http://open.mitchellhamline.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1819&context=wmlr online]</ref>\n\nThe [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which allowed the Federal Government to tax all income, was adopted in 1913.\n\nThe [[Emergency Quota Act]] (1921) established a quota system on immigrants by country of origin, with the maximum number of annual immigrants from a country limited to 3% of the number of that national background living in the U.S. according to the [[1910 United States Census]].  The [[Immigration Act of 1924]] reduced the quota from 3% to 2% and added additional restrictions on certain nationalities.\n\nIn the early years of American history, most political leaders were reluctant to involve the federal government too heavily in the private sector, except in the area of transportation. In general, they accepted the concept of [[laissez-faire]], a doctrine opposing government interference in the economy except to maintain law and order. This attitude started to change during the latter part of the 19th century, when small business, farm, and labor movements began asking the government to intercede on their behalf.<ref name=\"Harold U.

Known as [[Progressives]], these people favored government regulation of business practices to, in their minds, ensure competition and free enterprise. Congress enacted a law regulating railroads in 1887 (the [[Interstate Commerce Act]]), and one preventing large firms from controlling a single industry in 1890 (the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]). These laws were not rigorously enforced, however, until the years between 1900 and 1920, when Republican President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (1901\u20131909), Democrat President [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913\u20131921), and others sympathetic to the views of the Progressives came to power. Many of today's U.S. regulatory agencies were created during these years, including the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. [[Ida M.

In 1913, the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]] was ratified, and the [[income tax]] was instituted in the United States.

Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] worked to introduce efficiency, by [[regulation|regulating]] business practices. This period of prosperity, along with the culture of the time, was known as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. The rapid growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil, glass, and road-building. Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a much wider radius for their shopping. Small cities prospered, and large cities had their best decade ever, with a boom in construction of offices, factories and homes. The new electric power industry transformed both business and everyday life. Telephones and electricity spread to the countryside, but farmers never recovered from the wartime bubble in land prices. Millions migrated to nearby cities. However, in October 1929, the [[Stock market crash]]ed and banks began to fail in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref>George Soule, ''The Prosperity Decade: From War to Depression, 1917\u20131929''  (1947)</ref>\n\n===Quality of life===\nThe early decades of the 20th century were remarkable for the improvements of the quality of life in the U.S.  The quality of housing improved, with houses offering better protection against cold. Floor space per occupant increased.  Sanitation was greatly improved by the building of water supply and sewage systems, plus the treatment of drinking water by filtration and chlorination.

The U.S. money supply began to contract by one-third. The protectionist [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]] incited retaliation by Canada, Britain, Germany and other trading partners. Congress, in 1932, worried about the rapidly growing deficit and national debt, and raised income tax rates. Economists generally agree that these measures deepened an already serious crisis. By 1932, the unemployment rate was 25%. Conditions were worse in heavy industry, lumbering, export agriculture (cotton, wheat, tobacco), and mining. Conditions were not quite as bad in white collar sectors and in light manufacturing.<ref>Broadus Mitchell, ''The Depression Decade: From New Era through New Deal, 1929\u20131941'' (1947)</ref>\n\n[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was elected President in 1932 without a specific program.

Roosevelt balanced the \"regular\" budget the emergency budget was funded by debt, which increased from 33.6% of GNP in 1932 to 40.9% in 1936.[1] Deficit spending had been recommended by some economists, most notably John Maynard Keynes in Britain. Roosevelt met Keynes but did not pay attention to his recommendations. After a meeting with Keynes, who kept drawing diagrams, Roosevelt remarked that \"He must be a mathematician rather than a political economist\". John Keynes approach to the great depression could have been a solution. His method was to keep the feds spending as much as they could even on random purchases but the money had to keep moving. It is believed that if America went through with John Keynes plan the Great Depression could have been avoided entirely. The Feds started to spend more when President Roosevelt came in to office as the federal government doubled income tax rates in 1932. Total government tax revenues as a percentage of GDP shot up from 10.8% in 1929 to 16.6% in 1933. Higher tax rates tended to reduce consumption and aggregate demand. Spending would go up and America would get out of the great depression when World War II happened after Japan\u2019s attack on American forces in Pearl Harbor in December of 1941 led to much sharper increases in government purchases, and the economy pushed quickly into an inflationary gap.\n.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moggridge |first=Donald Edward |title=Maynard Keynes: An Economist's Biography |year=1992 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-05141-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/maynardkeyneseco0047mogg/page/582 582] |url=https://archive.org/details/maynardkeyneseco0047mogg |url-access=registration |accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref>\n<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://open.lib.umn.edu/macroeconomics/chapter/17-1-the-great-depression-and-keynesian-economics/ | title=17.1 the Great Depression and Keynesian Economics \u2013 Principles of Macroeconomics}}</ref>\n\n====Banking crisis====\nIn 1929\u201333 the economy was destabilized by bank failures. The initial reasons were substantial losses in investment banking, followed by [[bank run]]s. Bank runs occurred when a large number of customers lost confidence in their deposits (which were not insured) and rushed to withdraw their deposits. Runs destabilized many banks to the point where they faced bankruptcy. Between 1929 and 1933 40% of all banks (9,490 out of 23,697 banks) went bankrupt.<ref>R. W. Hafer, ''The Federal Reserve System'' (Greenwood, 2005) p  18</ref> Much of the [[Great Depression]]'s economic damage was caused directly by bank runs.<ref>[[Ben Bernanke]], \"Nonmonetary effects of the financial crisis in the propagation of the Great Depression\", (1983) ''American Economic Review'' .

It provided for a system of reopening sound banks under [[United States Department of Treasury|Treasury]] supervision, with federal loans available if needed. Three-quarters of the banks in the [[Federal Reserve System]] reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6 billion; depositors lost a total of $540 million, and eventually received on average 85 cents on the dollar of their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Milton Friedman |author2=Anna Jacobson Schwartz |title=A Monetary History of the United States, 1867\u20131960 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7J_EUM3RfoC&pg=PA427 |year=1963 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-00354-2 |pages=438\u20139}}</ref> The [[Glass\u2013Steagall Act]] limited commercial bank securities activities and affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms to regulate speculations.

Job losses were  less severe among women than men, among workers in nondurable industries (such as food and clothing), in services and sales, and in government jobs. The least skilled inner city men had much higher unemployment rates, as did young people who had a hard time getting their first job, and men over the age of 45 who if they lost their job would seldom find another one because employers had their choice of younger men. Millions were hired in the Great Depression, but men with weaker credentials were never hired, and fell into a long-term unemployment trap. The migration that brought millions of farmers and townspeople to the bigger cities in the 1920s suddenly reversed itself, as unemployment made the cities unattractive, and the network of kinfolk and more ample food supplies made it wise for many to go back.<ref>Richard J. Jensen, \"The causes and cures of unemployment in the Great Depression.\" ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (1989): 553\u2013583  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203954  in JSTOR]; [http://tigger.uic.edu/~rjensen/causes-cures.pdf online copy]</ref><ref>Robert  A.

However tax revenues were plunging, and the cities as well as private relief agencies were totally overwhelmed by 1931 men were unable to provide significant additional relief. They fell back on the cheapest possible relief, soup kitchens which provided free meals for anyone who showed up.<ref>Janet Poppendieck, ''Breadlines knee-deep in wheat: Food assistance in the Great Depression'' (2014)</ref> After 1933 new sales taxes and infusions of federal money helped relieve the fiscal distress of the cities, but the budgets did not fully recover until 1941.\n\nThe federal programs launched by Hoover and greatly expanded by president Roosevelt's [[New Deal]] used massive construction projects to try to jump start the economy and solve the unemployment crisis. The alphabet agencies ERA, CCC, FERA, WPA and PWA built and repaired the public infrastructure in dramatic fashion, but did little to foster the recovery of the private sector. FERA, CCC, and especially WPA focused on providing unskilled jobs for long-term unemployed men.<ref>Donald S. Howard, ''The WPA and Federal Relief Policy'' (1943) [https://www.questia.com/library/1220692/the-wpa-and-federal-relief-policy Online edition]</ref>\n\n====Relief====\nThe extent to which the spending for relief and public works provided a sufficient stimulus to revive the U.S. economy, or whether it harmed the economy, is also debated. If one defines economic health entirely by the gross domestic product, the U.S. had gotten back on track by 1934, and made a full recovery by 1936, but as Roosevelt said, one third of the nation was ill fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed. See Chart 3. GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than 1932, and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. The economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in 8 years of peacetime, and then grew another 56% from 1940 to 1945 in 5 years of wartime. The unemployment rate fell from 25.2% in 1932 to 13.9% in 1940 when the draft started. During the war the economy operated under so many different conditions that comparison is impossible with peacetime, such as massive spending, price controls, bond campaigns, controls over raw materials, prohibitions on new housing and new automobiles, rationing, guaranteed cost-plus profits, subsidized wages, and the draft of 12 million soldiers.\n\n[[File:PIBUSA1920-40.svg|lang=en|thumb|Chart 3: GDP annual pattern and long-term trend, 1920\u201340, in billions of constant dollars<ref>based on data in Susan Carter, ed.

A survey of academic specialists by Whaples showed that 49% of those economists surveyed felt that the New Deal lengthened and deepened the depression, while 51% disagreed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/business/economy/2008/04/11/did-the-new-deal-work.html|title=Did the New Deal Work}}</ref> The same survey also showed that only 5% of professional historians and 27% of professional economists felt the same way. However, economist [[Eric Rauchway]] of the [[University of California]] stated \"very few people disapprove of most of the New Deal reforms\", which include Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and Fannie Mae.

The farm programs typically aided large farm owners but eliminated opportunities for share croppers, tenants, and farm workers. The Home Owners' Loan Corporation's purchases and refinancing of troubled mortgages staved off drops in housing prices and home ownership rates at relatively low ex post cost to taxpayers. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loans to banks and railroads appear to have had little positive impact, although the banks were aided when the RFC took ownership stakes.</blockquote>\n\n===Wartime output and controls: 1940\u20131945===\n[[File:Women aluminum shells wwii.jpg|thumb|Women making aluminum shells for the war in 1942]]\nUnemployment dropped to 2%, relief programs largely ended, and the industrial economy grew rapidly to new heights as millions of people moved to new jobs in war centers, and 16 million men and 300,000 women were drafted or volunteered for military service.\n\nAll economic sectors grew during the war. Farm output went from an index (by volume) of 106 in 1939 to 128 in 1943. Coal output went from 446 million tons in 1939 to 651 in 1943; oil from 1.3 billion barrels to 1.5 billion. Manufacturing output doubled, from a volume index of 109 in 1939 to 239 in 1943.

Converted consumer-products plants filled many military orders. Automakers built tanks and aircraft, for example, making the United States the \"arsenal of democracy\". In an effort to prevent rising national income and scarce consumer products from causing inflation, the newly created [[Office of Price Administration]] rationed and set prices for consumer items ranging from sugar to meat, clothing and gasoline, and otherwise tried to restrain price increases. It also set rent in war centers.<ref>Harold G.

Bill]] financed a well-educated work force. The middle class swelled, as did GDP and productivity. This growth was distributed fairly evenly across the economic classes, which some attribute to the strength of labor unions in this period\u2014labor union membership peaked historically in the U.S. during the 1950s, in the midst of this massive economic growth. Much of the growth came from the movement of low income farm workers into better paying jobs in the towns and cities\u2014a process largely completed by 1960.\n\nCongress created the [[Council of Economic Advisors]], to promote high employment, high profits and low inflation. The Eisenhower administration (1953\u20131961) supported an activist contracyclical approach that helped to establish [[Keynesianism]] as a bipartisan economic policy for the nation.

So the well-organized Farm Bureau and other lobbyists, worked in the 1970s to appeal to urban Congressman through  food stamp programs for the poor. By 2000, the food stamp program was the largest component of the farm bill. In 2010, the [[Tea Party movement]] brought in many Republicans committed to cutting all federal subsidies, including those agriculture. Meanwhile, urban Democrats strongly opposed reductions,  pointing to the severe hardships caused by the 2008\u201310 economic recession. The [[Agricultural Act of 2014]] saw many rural Republican Congressman voting against the program despite its support from farmers; it passed with urban support.<ref>Christopher  Bosso, ''Framing the Farm Bill: Interests, Ideology, and Agricultural Act of 2014'' (2017).</ref><ref>Carl Zulauf and David Orden, \"The US Agricultural Act of 2014: Overview and Analysis.\" (International Food Policy Research Institute  discussion paper 01393, 2014) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Orden2/publication/308138378_The_US_Agricultural_Act_of_2014/links/57dae99e08ae5292a3768d07.pdf online].</ref><ref>David Orden and Carl Zulauf, \"Political economy of the 2014 farm bill.\" ''American Journal of Agricultural Economics'' 97.5 (2015): 1298\u20131311.

The United States was the leading producer of combat aircraft during World War II and had a large surplus of machine tools and manufacturing facilities for airplanes at the end of the war.[3] There were also experienced airplane manufacturing and maintenance personnel. Additionally, radar had been developed just before the war.\n\nThe aircraft industry had the highest productivity growth of any major industry, growing by 8.9% per year in 1929\u20131966.\n\nDuring World War 2 the United States hired hundreds of thousands of workers put them all in 4 major factories and had a government budget of over 3 billion dollars which would be have been 50,024,489,795.92 dollars in 2017. The B-29 project required the US Army Air Forces to have unprecedented organizational capabilities as this project included several major private contractors and labor unions. American aircraft production was the single largest sector of the war economy, costing $45 billion (almost a quarter of the $183 billion spent on war production), employing a staggering two million workers, and, most importantly, producing over 125,000 aircraft.\n\nProduction of Selected U.S. Military Aircraft (1941\u20131945): Bombers-49,123 Fighters-63,933 Cargo-14,710 Total-127,766\n<ref name=\"Rosenberg-1982\">{{cite book |title= Inside the Black Box: Technology and Economics |last= Rosenberg |first= Nathan |authorlink=  |year= 1982 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge, New York |isbn= 978-0-521-27367-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/164 164] |ref= harv |url= https://archive.org/details/insideblackboxte00rose/page/164 }}</ref>\n\n===Housing===\nVery little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War II, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing non-farm units had been constructed from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 units built annually from 1946 through 1955.<ref>U.S. Bureau of the Census, ''Historical Statistics of the United States '' (1976) series H-156</ref>\n\nThe G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16 million eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7300. The construction industry kept prices low by standardization \u2013 for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators and stoves, allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, or local public officials race to build schools.<ref>Joseph Goulden, ''The Best Years, 1945\u20131950'' (1976) pp 135\u201339.</ref> The most famous development was [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.<ref>Barbara Mae Kelly, ''Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown'' (SUNY Press, 1993).</ref>\n\n===Interstate highway system===\nConstruction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] began in 1956.\n\n===Computer technology===\n{{Main|Computer}}\nMainframe business computer systems were introduced in the 1950s following the manufacture of [[transistor]]s. Mainframe computers\nwere in widespread use by the 1960s. These computers handled a variety of accounting, billing and payroll applications.\n\nOne highly significant application was the [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre airline reservations system]], which first went into operation in 1960. With Sabre reservations could be placed remotely using teleprinters and all functions were done automatically, including ticket printing. This eliminated manually handling file cards.\n\n===Fiscal policy===\nFederal taxes on incomes, profits and payrolls had risen to high levels during World War II and had been cut back only slowly; the highest rates for individuals reached the 90% level. Congress cut tax rates in 1964. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (1963\u201369) dreamed of creating a \"[[Great Society]]\", and began many new social programs to that end, such as [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].\n\n===Military and space spending===\nAfter the [[Cold War]] began in 1947, and especially after the [[Korean War]] began in 1950, the government adopted a strategy in [[NSC 68]] military spending.<ref>Ken Young, \"Revisiting NSC 68,\" ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' (2013) 15#1 pp: 3\u201333.</ref> Economists examined how much this \"military Keynesianism\" stimulated the economy.<ref>Alex Mintz, and Alexander Hicks. \"Military Keynesianism in the United States, 1949\u20131976: Disaggregating military expenditures and their determination.\" ''American Journal of Sociology'' (1984): 411\u2013417 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2779222 in  JSTOR].</ref>\n\nPresident Eisenhower feared that excessive military spending would damage the economy, so he downsized the Army after Korea and shifted priorities to missiles and nuclear weapons (which were much less expensive than army divisions). He also promoted the [[Interstate Highway]] system as necessary for national defense, and made space exploration a priority. His successor [[John F. Kennedy]] made a manned mission to the moon a national priority. Much of the new spending went to California and the West, a continuation of wartime spending.<ref>Kevin Fernlund, ''The Cold War American West'' (1998)</ref>\n\nAn even greater impact came in the South, where it stimulated a modernization of the economy away from cotton towards manufacturing and high technology. For example, there were new, large technologically sophisticated installations at the Atomic Energy Commission's [[Savannah River Site]] in South Carolina; the [[Redstone Arsenal]] at Huntsville in Alabama; nuclear research facilities at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory|Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]; and space facilities at [[Space Coast|Cape Canaveral]], Florida, at the [[Lyndon B.

The United States grew increasingly dependent on oil importation from [[OPEC]] after [[Oil reserves in the United States|peaking production]] in 1970, resulting in oil supply shocks in 1973 and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]. [[Stagflation]] gripped the nation, and the government experimented with [[incomes policy|wage and price controls]] under [[Richard Nixon|President Nixon]].\nThe [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] collapsed in 1971\u20131972, and President Nixon closed the gold window at the Federal Reserve, taking the United States entirely off the [[gold standard]].<ref name=\"Michael French 1997\"/>\n\nPresident [[Gerald Ford]] introduced the slogan, \"[[Whip Inflation Now]]\" (WIN). In 1974, productivity shrunk by 1.5%, though this soon recovered. In 1976, [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Presidency. Carter would later take much of the blame for the even more turbulent economic times to come, though some{{who|date=September 2011}} say circumstances were outside his control. Inflation continued to climb skyward. Productivity growth was small, when not negative. Interest rates remained high, with the prime reaching 20% in January 1981; [[Art Buchwald]] quipped that 1980 would go down in history as the year when it was cheaper to borrow money from the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] than the local bank.<ref name=\"Michael French 1997\">Michael French,  ''US  Economic History since 1945'' (1997)</ref>\n\nUnemployment dropped mostly steadily from 1975 to 1979, although it then began to rise sharply.\n\nThis period also saw the increased rise of the environmental and consumer movements, and the government established new regulations and regulatory agencies such as the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], and others.\n\n===Deregulation and Reaganomics: 1976\u20131992===\nDeregulation gained momentum in the mid-1970s, spurred by slow productivity growth and increasing operation and capital costs in several key sectors. It was not until 1978 that the first meaningful deregulation legislation, the [[Airline Deregulation Act]], was cleared by Congress. Transportation deregulation accelerated in 1980, with the deregulation of railroads and trucking. Deregulation of interstate buses followed in 1982. In addition to transportation deregulation, savings and loan associations and banks were partially deregulated with the [[Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act]] in 1980 and the [[Garn\u2013St. Germain Depository Institutions Act]] in 1982.\n\nOn a broader front, the economy initially recovered at a brisk pace from the [[1973\u201375 recession]]. Incoming president [[Jimmy Carter]] instituted a large fiscal stimulus package in 1977 in order to boost the economy. However, inflation began a steep rise beginning in late 1978, and rose by double digits following the [[1979 energy crisis]].

From 1982 to 1987 the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] gained over 1900 points from 776 in 1982 to 2722 in 1987 \u2013 about a 350% increase. An economic boom took place from 1983 until a recession began in 1990. Between 1983 and 1989 the number of people below the poverty line decreased by 3.8 million.<ref name=\"Gregg Jackson 2011\"/>\n\nThe boom saw the increasing popularity of electronic appliances like computers, cell phones, music players and video games. Credit cards were a symbol of the boom. The Reagan tax cuts seemed to work and Americans were able to shrug off the crash of 1987 by the beginning of 1988. The growth ended by 1990 after seven years of stock market growth and prosperity for the upper and middle class. The [[federal debt]] spawned by his policies tripled (from $930&nbsp;billion in 1981 to $2.6&nbsp;trillion in 1988), reaching record levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com//ac2/wp-dyn/A26402-2004Jun8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501122208/http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A26402-2004Jun8|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 1, 2011|title=Reagan Policies Gave Green Light to Red Ink (washingtonpost.com)|date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough debt almost always increased under every president in the latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior to Reagan. In addition to the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large [[trade deficits]]. Also it was during his second term that the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]] was passed. Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]] was elected to succeed Reagan in [[1988 U.S. presidential election|1988]]. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the [[Americans With Disabilities Act]], and negotiating the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate [[Ross Perot]] lost to Democrat [[Bill Clinton]].<ref>Peter B. Levy, ''Encyclopedia of the Reagan-Bush Years'' (1996)</ref>\n\nThe advent of deindustrialization in the late 1960s and early 1970s [[Great Divergence (inequality)|saw income inequality increase dramatically]] to levels never seen before. But at the same time, most orthodox economists, and most policy makers, pointed to the fact that consumers could buy so many goods, even with the inflation of the 1970s, as evidence that the general shift away from manufacturing and into services was creating widespread prosperity. In 1968, the U.S. [[Gini coefficient]] was 0.386. In 2005, the American Gini coefficient had reached 0.469.\n\nCritics of economic policies favored by Republican and Democratic administrations since the 1960s, particularly those expanding \"free trade\" and \"open markets\" (see [[Neoliberalism]]) say that these policies, though benefiting trading as well as the cost of products in the U.S., could have taken their own on the prosperity of the America middle-class. But in this period, consumers were buying as never before with so many products and goods at such low costs and in high quantities. Critics however argued that this consumer behavior was giving a false reading of the health of the economy, because it was being paid for by taking on rapidly increasing levels of indebtedness, thus covering up the stagnating wages and earnings of most of the workforce.\n\n===The rise of globalization: 1990s \u2013 late 2000===\n{{Main|New economy|1990s United States boom}}\n[[File:Comparison of three stock indices after 1975.svg|thumb|300px|This graph shows three major stock indices since 1975. Notice the meteoric rise of the stock market in the 1990s, followed by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] in 2000 on the tech-heavy [[NASDAQ]].]]\n\nDuring the 1990s, [[government debt]] increased by 75%, GDP rose by 69%, and the stock market as measured by the [[S&P 500]] grew more than threefold.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2000 real output increased, inflation was manageable and unemployment dropped to below 5%, resulting in a soaring stock market known as the [[dot-com boom]]. The second half of the 1990s was characterized by well-publicized [[initial public offering]]s of high-tech and \"[[dot-com company|dot-com]]\" companies. By 2000, however, it was evident a bubble in stock valuations ''had'' occurred, such that beginning in March 2000, the market would give back some 50% to 75% of the growth of the 1990s.\n\n==21st century==\n{{Update section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main|Economy of the United States}}\nThe economy worsened in 2001 with output increasing only 0.3% and unemployment and business failures rising substantially, and [[early 2000s recession|triggering a recession]] that is often blamed on the [[September 11 attacks]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAn additional factor in the fall of the US markets and in investor confidence included numerous [[list of corporate scandals|corporate scandals]].\n\nIn 2001\u20132007, the red-hot housing market across the United States fueled a false sense of security regarding the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\n===Great Recession===\n{{Further|Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|Automotive industry crisis of 2008\u201310}}\n\nThe Great Recession was a sharp decline in the United States' economy. In 2008, a series of related economic disasters hit the American and European financial systems. The bursting of a worldwide bubble in housing set the recession in motion. The end of [[United States housing bubble|housing bubbles]] in California, Florida and Arizona led to the collapse of housing prices and the shrinkage of construction sector. Millions of [[mortgages]] (averaging about $200,000 each) had been bundled into securities called [[collateralized debt obligation]]s that were resold worldwide. Many banks and hedge funds had borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to buy these securities, which were now \"[[toxic asset#Debt repackaging and subprime crisis|toxic]]\" because their value was unknown and no one wanted to buy them.<ref>Charles R. Morris, ''The Two Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers, and the Great Credit Crash'' (2009)</ref>\n\nA series of the largest banks in the U.S. and Europe collapsed; some went bankrupt, such as [[Lehman Brothers]] with $690&nbsp;billion in assets; others such as the leading [[American International Group|insurance company AIG]], the leading bank [[Citigroup]], and the two largest mortgage companies were bailed out by the government. Congress voted $700&nbsp;billion in bailout money, and the Treasury and Federal Reserve committed trillions of dollars to shoring up the financial system, but the measures did not reverse the declines. Banks drastically tightened their lending policies, despite infusions of federal money. The government for the first time took major ownership positions in the largest banks. The stock market plunged 40%, wiping out tens of trillions of dollars in wealth; housing prices fell 20% nationwide wiping out trillions more. By late 2008 distress was spreading beyond the financial and housing sectors, especially as the \"Big Three\" of the automobile industry ([[General Motors]], [[Ford]] and [[Chrysler]]) were on the verge of bankruptcy, and the retail sector showed major weaknesses. Critics of the $700&nbsp;billion [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]] (TARP) expressed anger that much of the TARP money that has been distributed to banks is seemingly unaccounted for, with banks being secretive on the issue.<ref>Mauro F.

The plan is largely based on the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian theory]] that government spending should offset the fall in private spending during an economic downturn; otherwise the fall in private spending may perpetuate itself and productive resources, such as the labor hours of the unemployed, will be wasted. Critics claim that government spending cannot offset a fall in private spending because government must borrow money from the private sector in order to add money to it. However, most economists do not think such \"[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]\" is an issue when [[Zero interest rate policy|interest rates are near zero]] and the economy is [[economic stagnation|stagnant]]. Opponents of the stimulus also point to problems of possible future inflation and [[government debt]] caused by such a large expenditure.<ref>Mark H.
