It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]].

[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]].

For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada. This will be the defined scope which is used in this article, unless otherwise specified in a particular area.<ref name=LCASDefine />\n\n===Geological/topographical===\nFrom this perspective, almost all of the region's physiographical traits, geological formations, and weather are contained within a box between 26\u00b0 and 38\u00b0 northern latitude, and 98\u00b0 30' and  124\u00b0 western longitude.<ref name=UAtsd>{{cite web | url=http://jsw.library.arizona.edu/3403/defined.html | publisher=University of Arizona | title=The Southwest Defined | editor-last=Wilder | editor-first=Joseph Carlton | accessdate=July 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological===\nWhen looking at the fauna of the region, there is a broader definition of the American Southwest.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees.\n\n[[File:Curry County Eastern New Mexico 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] in [[Eastern New Mexico]], but also located in [[Colorado Eastern Plains|Eastern Colorado]] and [[West Texas]]]]\nLandscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains, canyons, mesas, [[butte]]s, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some plains, characteristic of the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

Meinig]] defines the Southwest in a very similar fashion to Reed: the portion of New Mexico west of the [[Llano Estacado]] and the portion of Arizona east of the [[Mojave Desert|Mojave]]-[[Sonoran Desert]] and south of the \"canyon lands\" and also including the [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] district of western Texas and the southernmost part of Colorado.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 3\u20138</ref> Meinig breaks the Southwest down into four distinct subregions. He calls the first subregion \"[[Northern New Mexico]]\", and describes it as focused on [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called [[Central New Mexico]].\n\n\"Central Arizona\" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and many others.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 103\u2013106</ref>\n\nMeinig calls the third subregion \"El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands\". While [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

At the same time, two robotic replicas of Billy and Mandy are sent into the past, to stop the real Billy and Mandy from interfering with the current events.\n\nIn the present, Grim goes to reap General Skarr, who accidentally got a big wound in his torso. Due to Billy and Mandy's meddling, Skarr escapes, and they make a big mess in the city. Following his failure to be an effective Reaper, Grim is taken to the Underworld Court, presided by Judge Roy Spleen, where he is sued for misuse of his powers by his nemesis, the Boogeyman. Grim is found guilty, is stripped of his rank and magical scythe, and he, Billy, Mandy, and Irwin are sentenced to be exiled. Boogey volunteers to carry on the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] by taking the prisoners aboard his ship, and dropping them off in a river of fire; he plans to do this while he sails to obtain Horror's Hand, an object capable of transforming him into the scariest, strongest and most powerful being in existence.\n\nThe group of Billy, Mandy, Irwin, and the powerless Grim, escapes from Boogey's ship when Billy distracts Boogey and his crew with the song \"Scary-o\", and set themselves to reach Horror's Hand before Boogey does. They eventually meet Horror, the guardian of the Hand, at the same time Boogey and his [[crew]] arrive. To decide who will have the honor to battle Horror for his Hand, the heroes and Boogey participate in a challenging [[obstacle course]], which the heroes win against all odds. After dispatching Horror with ease, Billy, Mandy, and Irwin reach for the Hand, but it defends itself by making their worst nightmares come to life. Boogey gets hold of Horror's Hand, but he turns out to be the least scariest creature ever, seriously injuring himself, and being abandoned by his own crew.\n\nGrim recovers Horror's Hand, and at the same time his sentence is revoked, becoming the Reaper once again. The future Billy arrives, telling them Horror's Hand should not fall in the wrong hands, specifically Mandy's as he indirectly reveals that she was the one who used Horror's Hand to rule the world. When they return home, Grim seals Horror's Hand in his bottomless trunk, and the future Billy returns to his own time. The future Billy realizes the situation in his time did not improve, and it is Fred Fredburger who obtained Horror's Hand to rule the world.\n|LineColor=DDAAEE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = [[Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen|Billy & Mandy: Wrath<br />of the Spider Queen]]\n |DirectedBy = Matt Engstrom, Gordon Kent,<br />Kris Sherwood, and Juli Hashiguchi\n |WrittenBy = Maxwell Atoms\n |Aux2 = Chris Headrick, [[Clayton Morrow|Clay Morrow]],<br />Alex Almaguer, and Mike Diederich\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|6}}\n |ShortSummary = On a rainy day, giant spiders appear in Billy and Mandy's school and start kidnapping the children one by one. Grim presumes this is somehow related to his past, but does not figure it out until he receives a message saying that Velma, the Spider Queen, an old good friend from high school, is responsible for it. Meanwhile, Billy meets with Jeff the Spider, who informs him that he is precisely marrying Velma. After trying to recover a talking carton of chocolate milk from Jeff, Billy and Jeff get into a fight, and Jeff looks angrier than ever before.\n\nUpon meeting in the school's football field, Velma tells Grim that she has finally come to devour his skull and absorb his magical and supernatural powers, since one hundred thousand years ago, Grim had cheated and robbed her from the possibility of becoming the Reaper in a scare election. Converting the school into her own palace, and with help from the [[Elf|Dark Elves]], Velma captures Mandy, Mindy, and Grim, and proceeds to devour the latter's skull. When Velma cracks open Grim's skull, his thoughts start coming out in the form of light blue light, and she is able to see his past memories.\n\nGrim's skull is connected to a projection screen, and the story on how he became the Reaper is shown. It is revealed that an [[election]] was held in the Underworld's high school to choose the Reaper, in which students had to vote on the scariest participant. Velma was the scariest contestant and she received more votes than the pathetic Grim and the Boogeyman. Boogey decided to tamper with the [[ballot]]s, and Grim in turn decided to help Velma by filling the ballot with votes for her, but she got the impression that Grim was the cheater and ran away. In a fit of anger for what Boogey had caused, Grim used the [[prototype]] scythe in a spectacular fashion to scare Boogey off. The people that had not yet cast their vote voted for Grim, who became the new Reaper. While the story is being told, Mandy and Mindy form a temporary alliance to fight the spiders, and also Billy conquers his [[arachnophobia]], and fights the spider-cow [[centaur]]-like extraterrestrial from the milk carton.\n\nVelma realizes she was wrong, with respect to Grim, and she apologizes for the whole vengeful ordeal.

Billy opens the door to his house expecting the [[The Powerpuff Girls|Powerpuff Girls]] but it turns out to be the [[Codename: Kids Next Door|Sector V operatives]]. Numbuh 1 disguises as Billy while Billy is taken back to the Deep Sea Lab. Mandy arrives at Billy's house and knows Numbuh 1 is not Billy, and tortures him into revealing the truth. Meanwhile, the Delightful Children from Down the Lane and Billy accidentally fuse with the scythe's power to create the Delightful Reaper. Mandy takes over the KND by fooling Numbuh 362 and the rest of the KND, but Numbuh 5 knows she is not Numbuh 1, but is taken to the med lab. The Delightful Reaper assimilates nearly all of Endsville (including Numbuh 2) and grows more powerful. Numbuh 1 and Grim try to get the KND to see the truth, but are imprisoned. Numbuh 5 escapes and finds Numbuh 1 and Grim. Grim and Numbuh 1 fuse with the Bone of Barnacles and become the Skeleton Samurai. Mandy, in her M.A.N.D.R.O.B.O.T. (Monkeys And Nice Doggies Ride On Bodies Of Turtles), fights the Delightful Reaper, and so does the Skeleton Samurai, but they cannot defeat it. Grim finds out that the pants belong to Billy's dad (which are shown to be immune to lasers, supernatural energies and mustard). Mandy is their only hope to defeat the Reaper, but instead she fuses with the Reaper. Billy's dad takes off the pants, and the Samurai Skeleton destroys the Reaper, freeing all of the assimilated children inside it. Mandy becomes furious with Numbuh 1 and Grim, and escapes to vow revenge. Numbuh 1 is mistaken to be Billy by Billy's dad, who punishes him for ruining his lucky pants, as Billy, on the other hand, disguises as Numbuh 1, causing the KND to throw various objects at him in response to prevent what happened that day.<br />'''Note''': This is an episode of ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]''.\n|LineColor=006161\n}}\n|}\n\n==Shorts==\n===Billy's Birthday Shorties===\nThese shorts were parts of a mini-series called ''Billy's Birthday Shorties'', which mostly starred Billy.

At the same time, two robotic replicas of Billy and Mandy are sent into the past, to stop the real Billy and Mandy from interfering with the current events.\n\nIn the present, Grim goes to reap General Skarr, who accidentally got a big wound in his torso. Due to Billy and Mandy's meddling, Skarr escapes, and they make a big mess in the city. Following his failure to be an effective Reaper, Grim is taken to the Underworld Court, presided by Judge Roy Spleen, where he is sued for misuse of his powers by his nemesis, the Boogeyman. Grim is found guilty, is stripped of his rank and magical scythe, and he, Billy, Mandy, and Irwin are sentenced to be exiled. Boogey volunteers to carry on the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] by taking the prisoners aboard his ship, and dropping them off in a river of fire; he plans to do this while he sails to obtain Horror's Hand, an object capable of transforming him into the scariest, strongest and most powerful being in existence.\n\nThe group of Billy, Mandy, Irwin, and the powerless Grim, escapes from Boogey's ship when Billy distracts Boogey and his crew with the song \"Scary-o\", and set themselves to reach Horror's Hand before Boogey does. They eventually meet Horror, the guardian of the Hand, at the same time Boogey and his [[crew]] arrive. To decide who will have the honor to battle Horror for his Hand, the heroes and Boogey participate in a challenging [[obstacle course]], which the heroes win against all odds. After dispatching Horror with ease, Billy, Mandy, and Irwin reach for the Hand, but it defends itself by making their worst nightmares come to life. Boogey gets hold of Horror's Hand, but he turns out to be the least scariest creature ever, seriously injuring himself, and being abandoned by his own crew.\n\nGrim recovers Horror's Hand, and at the same time his sentence is revoked, becoming the Reaper once again. The future Billy arrives, telling them Horror's Hand should not fall in the wrong hands, specifically Mandy's as he indirectly reveals that she was the one who used Horror's Hand to rule the world. When they return home, Grim seals Horror's Hand in his bottomless trunk, and the future Billy returns to his own time. The future Billy realizes the situation in his time did not improve, and it is Fred Fredburger who obtained Horror's Hand to rule the world.\n|LineColor=DDAAEE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |Title = [[Billy & Mandy: Wrath of the Spider Queen|Billy & Mandy: Wrath<br />of the Spider Queen]]\n |DirectedBy = Matt Engstrom, Gordon Kent,<br />Kris Sherwood, and Juli Hashiguchi\n |WrittenBy = Maxwell Atoms\n |Aux2 = Chris Headrick, [[Clayton Morrow|Clay Morrow]],<br />Alex Almaguer, and Mike Diederich\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|6}}\n |ShortSummary = On a rainy day, giant spiders appear in Billy and Mandy's school and start kidnapping the children one by one. Grim presumes this is somehow related to his past, but does not figure it out until he receives a message saying that Velma, the Spider Queen, an old good friend from high school, is responsible for it. Meanwhile, Billy meets with Jeff the Spider, who informs him that he is precisely marrying Velma. After trying to recover a talking carton of chocolate milk from Jeff, Billy and Jeff get into a fight, and Jeff looks angrier than ever before.\n\nUpon meeting in the school's football field, Velma tells Grim that she has finally come to devour his skull and absorb his magical and supernatural powers, since one hundred thousand years ago, Grim had cheated and robbed her from the possibility of becoming the Reaper in a scare election. Converting the school into her own palace, and with help from the [[Elf|Dark Elves]], Velma captures Mandy, Mindy, and Grim, and proceeds to devour the latter's skull. When Velma cracks open Grim's skull, his thoughts start coming out in the form of light blue light, and she is able to see his past memories.\n\nGrim's skull is connected to a projection screen, and the story on how he became the Reaper is shown. It is revealed that an [[election]] was held in the Underworld's high school to choose the Reaper, in which students had to vote on the scariest participant. Velma was the scariest contestant and she was getting most of the votes over the pathetic Grim and the Boogeyman. Boogey decided to tamper with the [[ballot]]s, and Grim in turn decided to help Velma by filling the ballot with votes for her, but she got the impression that Grim was the cheater and ran away. In a fit of anger for what Boogey had caused, Grim used the [[prototype]] scythe in a spectacular fashion to scare Boogey off. The people that had not yet cast their vote voted for Grim, who became the new Reaper. While the story is being told, Mandy and Mindy form a temporary alliance to fight the spiders, and also Billy conquers his [[arachnophobia]], and fights the spider-cow [[centaur]]-like extraterrestrial from the milk carton.\n\nVelma realizes she was wrong, with respect to Grim, and she apologizes for the whole vengeful ordeal. After the [[wedding ceremony]], Billy suddenly realizes Velma is a spider, and forbids Jeff from getting married to her, despite the fact that Jeff is a spider too. With no wedding and no revenge, Velma decides to go ahead and conquer Earth, just like her parents wanted.\n|LineColor=DDAAEE\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |Title = [[Underfist: Halloween Bash|Underfist: Halloween<br />Bash]]\n |DirectedBy = Shaun Cashman\n |WrittenBy = Maxwell Atoms\n |Aux2 = Maxwell Atoms<br />Alex Almaguer, Spencer Laudiero, Kelsey<br />Mann, and Ian Wasseluk <small>(additional)</small>\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|10|12}}\n |ShortSummary = Billy, Mandy, and Irwin go [[trick-or-treating]] on [[Halloween]], and an evil [[marshmallow]] bunny attacks children with chocolate beasts.\n|LineColor=DDAAEE\n}}\n|}\n\n===Special===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #006161;\" | Title\n! style=\"background-color: #006161;\" | Written by\n! style=\"background-color: #006161;\" | Storyboarded by\n! style=\"background-color: #006161;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n |Title = The Grim Adventures of the KND\n |WrittenBy = [[Maxwell Atoms]] and [[Tom Warburton|Mr. Warburton]]\n |Aux2 = Maurice Fontenot, Jesse Schmal, Alex Almaguer, and Scott \"Diggs\" Underwood\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|11|11}}\n |ShortSummary = While Billy's dad is underwear shopping, Billy wears his dad's lucky pants, and accidentally rips them with Grim's scythe. Billy opens the door to his house expecting the [[The Powerpuff Girls|Powerpuff Girls]] but it turns out to be the [[Codename: Kids Next Door|Sector V operatives]]. Numbuh 1 disguises as Billy while Billy is taken back to the Deep Sea Lab. Mandy arrives at Billy's house and knows Numbuh 1 is not Billy, and tortures him into revealing the truth. Meanwhile, the Delightful Children from Down the Lane and Billy accidentally fuse with the scythe's power to create the Delightful Reaper. Mandy takes over the KND by fooling Numbuh 362 and the rest of the KND, but Numbuh 5 knows she is not Numbuh 1, but is taken to the med lab. The Delightful Reaper assimilates nearly all of Endsville (including Numbuh 2) and grows more powerful. Numbuh 1 and Grim try to get the KND to see the truth, but are imprisoned. Numbuh 5 escapes and finds Numbuh 1 and Grim. Grim and Numbuh 1 fuse with the Bone of Barnacles and become the Skeleton Samurai. Mandy, in her M.A.N.D.R.O.B.O.T. (Monkeys And Nice Doggies Ride On Bodies Of Turtles), fights the Delightful Reaper, and so does the Skeleton Samurai, but they cannot defeat it. Grim finds out that the pants belong to Billy's dad (which are shown to be immune to lasers, supernatural energies and mustard). Mandy is their only hope to defeat the Reaper, but instead she fuses with the Reaper. Billy's dad takes off the pants, and the Samurai Skeleton destroys the Reaper, freeing all of the assimilated children inside it. Mandy becomes furious with Numbuh 1 and Grim, and escapes to vow revenge. Numbuh 1 is mistaken to be Billy by Billy's dad, who punishes him for ruining his lucky pants, as Billy, on the other hand, disguises as Numbuh 1, causing the KND to throw various objects at him in response to prevent what happened that day.<br />'''Note''': This is an episode of ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]''.\n|LineColor=006161\n}}\n|}\n\n==Shorts==\n===Billy's Birthday Shorties===\nThese shorts were parts of a mini-series called ''Billy's Birthday Shorties'', which mostly starred Billy.
