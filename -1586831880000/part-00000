Under the scheme, Gujarat plans to generate 5 MW of solar power by putting solar panels on about 50 state-government buildings and 500 private buildings.\n\nIt also plans to generate solar power by putting solar panels along the Narmada canals. As part of this scheme, the state has commissioned the 1 MW [[Canal Solar Power Project]] on a branch of the [[Narmada Canal]] near the village of Chandrasan in [[Mehsana district]].

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*6IXVI (6 Figure Music)\n*Ay Em\n*Baseman\n*Clue\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*Dappy\n*Fekky\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*House of Pharaohs\n*K-Trap\n*Lancey Foux\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*Nafe Smallz\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*S-X\n*S Loud\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*Sigeol\n*Skeamer\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n*Solo LDN\n*Suspect\n*TE dness\n*Young Tribez (formerly Bank Roll Young)\n*Yung Fume\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market.

Unlike in the US, the British hip hop scene was cross-racial from the beginning, as various ethnic groups in Britain tend not to live in segregated areas, even in areas with a high percentage of non-white individuals. Such places allow youth to share culture with one another, including musical genres such as hip hop.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom\", pp. 86\u2013101 in Global Noise: Rap and Hip Hop Outside of the USA, edited by Tony Mitchell.

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals. Scarlxrd has cited some of his main inspirations and influences as including the likes of [[Eminem]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Travi$ Scott]] and [[Linkin Park]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|work=Kerrang|title=SCARLXRD: \"BRING ME THE HORIZON\u2019S LEGACY INSPIRES ME\"|date=27 February 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806082026/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/scarlxrd-bring-me-the-horizons-legacy-inspires-me/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|work=XXL|title=Scarlxrd Ditches YouTuber Lifestyle and His Black Mask for Screamo Success|date=25 May 2019|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519003815/https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2019/05/scarlxrd-interview/|archive-date=19 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSgIYzwOYw|work=PopkillerTV|title=SCARLXRD \u2013 interview: \"My style is a mix of Eminem, Travis Scott and Slipknot\" (05.2018) \u2013 YouTube|date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNotable British trap artists and groups include:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*6IXVI (6 Figure Music)\n*Ay Em\n*Baseman\n*Clue\n*[[D-Block Europe]]\n*Dappy\n*Fekky\n*[[Fredo (rapper)|Fredo]]\n*House of Pharaohs\n*K-Trap\n*Lancey Foux\n*[[M Huncho]]\n*Nafe Smallz\n*[[Octavian (rapper)|Octavian]]\n*S-X\n*S Loud\n*[[Scarlxrd]]\n*Sigeol\n*Skeamer\n*[[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz)\n*[[Smoke Boys]] (formerly Section Boyz)\n*Solo LDN\n*Suspect\n*TE dness\n*Young Tribez (formerly Bank Roll Young)\n*Yung Fume\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Backlash against commercialisation==\nSince grime's post-millennial boom period coincided with UK hip-hop's, the eagerly anticipated commercial breakout of the latter did not happen. Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop.

The panelists then discuss that week's top news stories of concern to skeptics. This is generally followed with answering of listener email.\n\n<!-- \"Whaddyaknow?\" -->\n; \"What's the Word\": Cara Santa Maria presents a technical word, discussing the history and etymology of the word and how it currently applies to various scientific disciplines.\n\n[[File:Live at the Australian Skeptics National Convention 2014.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The SGU at 2014 Australian Skeptics National Convention. From left to right: George Hrab, Evan Bernstein, Rebecca Watson, Steven Novella, Jay Novella, Bob Novella, and Richard Saunders.]]\n\n;\"Forgotten Superheroes of Science\": Bob Novella describes a notable scientific figure from the past who is not well-known, ending with an encouragement to mention the figure to your friends when discussing their obscure area of expertise.\n\n; \"Who's That Noisy?\": A [[Media clip|sound clip]] is played for listeners to guess what, or who it is.  This segment was originally hosted by Bernstein, but is currently hosted by Jay Novella.  The first episode it appeared in was [https://legacy.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/181 #181].  The name comes from Steven's daughter who, when she was 2 years old, would say \"who's that noisy\" instead of \"what's that noise?\"\n\n; \"A Quickie with Bob\": Any of the rogues (apart from Bob) can ask for 'a quickie with Bob' who will then address an issue of current scientific news. Tends to happen before the interview section in around one minute, to a set length piece of background music.\n\n; Interview: Most weeks the panel interview a guest skeptic or scientist.\n\n; \"Science or Fiction\":  Steven Novella presents the panelists with three recent stories of a scientific nature, one of which is fiction. The co-hosts then have to use their knowledge of science and skeptical senses to figure out which story is fiction. The fake story may either be a complete fabrication or based on a factual story with a critical detail changed to make it fictitious. \"Science or Fiction\" is occasionally themed, such that all stories discuss similar topics.\n\n; \"Skeptical Quote\": The show closes with Jay Novella reading a quote from a famous person that is relevant to skepticism or science. Bob did the first skeptical quote although it wasn't really specific to any one of the rogues. (\"Isaac Asimov. A scientist fiction writer of some note.\") Jay announces the source in an exaggerated radio announcer voice. On May 10, 2008 host Steven Novella  posted a survey on the SGU message board asking listeners if they preferred Jay read the source of the quote before or after the reading of the quote.<ref>{{cite web|author=Novella, Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Topic: Skeptical Quote Survey|publisher=The Skeptics Guide to the Universe Forum|url=http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,10521.msg236235.html#msg236235|date=May 10, 2008|accessdate=April 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213603/https://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,10521.msg236235.html#msg236235|archive-date=April 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The voting is open ended.\n\nOnly since 2010, has the \"Who's That Noisy?\" segment been before the interview; pre-2010, it was just before the \"Skeptical Quote\".\n\nMost podcasts last around 80 minutes but on September 23, 2011 SGU produced a 24-hour-long podcast with contributions by skeptics from around the world. It was referred to as SGU-24.\n\n==== Occasional and defunct segments ====\n; \"Guest Rogue\": Since the start of 2010, sometimes, instead of having an interview, the Skeptic's Guide will invite a \"guest rogue\" to be present throughout the show including the news and \"Science or Fiction\" segments, as if they were one of the cast.\n\n; \"Skeptical Puzzle\": At the end of the show, Evan Bernstein used to present the listeners with a skeptical puzzle, usually about some person or topic within the field of [[pseudoscience]]. Occasionally the puzzle was presented in verse, and on Episode 96 it was presented as if by a fictional skeptical rapper Kom\u2019n Cents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204827/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-09-27|work=Official Skeptics' Guide Site|title=Episode 96}}</ref> Listeners would answer the puzzle via email or on the message board. Recognition (albeit no actual cash prize or gift) was given the following week to the first person to correctly answer the puzzle. The Skeptical puzzle has been discontinued since episode #130 to allow Evan to concentrate on other areas including SGU 5x5, though he has since occasionally offered a logic puzzle in lieu of \"Who's That Noisy?\".\n\n; This Day in History: Until 2015, the first segment after introductions was a description of a historical event of scientific or skeptical importance whose anniversary falls on the date of recording or the date the podcast is released.\n\n; \"Randi Speaks\": As of September 20, 2006, [[James Randi]] joined the podcast providing a pre-recorded commentary segment called \"Randi Speaks\". Randi, a professional magician and skeptic, expounds upon a topic on his mind for that week which may or may not have to do with skeptical matters. The segment disappeared for a period but returned for the August 8, 2007 episode with a different format. Instead of Randi delivering a prepared essay, an SGU host asks Randi a question which Randi then answers and expands upon.\n\n; \"Name That Logical Fallacy\": Steven Novella regularly presents the panelists with a recent argument, usually of a pseudoscientific nature, that has either appeared in recent news or has been submitted by listeners for consideration. The panelists are challenged to point out the flaws in the presented argument, with specific references to any [[informal fallacy|logical fallacies]] employed.

The panelists then discuss that week's top news stories of concern to skeptics. This is generally followed with answering of listener email.\n\n<!-- \"Whaddyaknow?\" -->\n; \"What's the Word\": Cara Santa Maria presents a technical word, discussing the history and etymology of the word and how it currently applies to various scientific disciplines.\n\n[[File:Live at the Australian Skeptics National Convention 2014.JPG|thumb|250x250px|The SGU at 2014 Australian Skeptics National Convention. From left to right: George Hrab, Evan Bernstein, Rebecca Watson, Steven Novella, Jay Novella, Bob Novella, and Richard Saunders.]]\n\n;\"Forgotten Superheroes of Science\": Bob Novella describes a notable scientific figure from the past who is not well-known, ending with an encouragement to mention the figure to your friends when discussing their obscure area of expertise.\n\n; \"Who's That Noisy?\": A [[Media clip|sound clip]] is played for listeners to guess what, or who it is.  This segment was originally hosted by Bernstein, but is currently hosted by Jay Novella.  The first episode it appeared in was [https://legacy.theskepticsguide.org/podcast/sgu/181 #181].  The name comes from Steven's daughter who, when she was 2 years old, would say \"who's that noisy\" instead of \"what's that noise?\"\n\n; \"A Quickie with Bob\": Any of the rogues (apart from Bob) can ask for 'a quickie with Bob' who will then address an issue of current scientific news. Tends to happen before the interview section in around one minute, to a set length piece of background music.\n\n; Interview: Most weeks the panel interview a guest skeptic or scientist.\n\n; \"Science or Fiction\":  Steven Novella presents the panelists with three recent stories of a scientific nature, one of which is fiction. The co-hosts then have to use their knowledge of science and skeptical senses to figure out which story is fiction. The fake story may either be a complete fabrication or based on a factual story with a critical detail changed to make it fictitious. \"Science or Fiction\" is occasionally themed, such that all stories discuss similar topics.\n\n; \"Skeptical Quote\": The show closes with Jay Novella reading a quote from a famous person that is relevant to skepticism or science. Bob did the first skeptical quote although it wasn't really specific to any one of the rogues. (\"Isaac Asimov. A scientist fiction writer of some note.\") Jay announces the source in an exaggerated radio announcer voice. On May 10, 2008 host Steven Novella  posted a survey on the SGU message board asking listeners if they preferred Jay read the source of the quote before or after the reading of the quote.<ref>{{cite web|author=Novella, Steven|authorlink=Steven Novella|title=Topic: Skeptical Quote Survey|publisher=The Skeptics Guide to the Universe Forum|url=http://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,10521.msg236235.html#msg236235|date=May 10, 2008|accessdate=April 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213603/https://sguforums.com/index.php/topic,10521.msg236235.html#msg236235|archive-date=April 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The voting is open ended.\n\nOnly since 2010, has the \"Who's That Noisy?\" segment been before the interview; pre-2010, it was just before the \"Skeptical Quote\".\n\nMost podcasts last around 80 minutes but on September 23, 2011 SGU produced a 24-hour-long podcast with contributions by skeptics from around the world. It was referred to as SGU-24.\n\n==== Occasional and defunct segments ====\n; \"Guest Rogue\": Since the start of 2010, sometimes, instead of having an interview, the Skeptic's Guide will invite a \"guest rogue\" to be present throughout the show including the news and \"Science or Fiction\" segments, as if they were one of the cast.\n\n; \"Skeptical Puzzle\": At the end of the show, Evan Bernstein used to present the listeners with a skeptical puzzle, usually about some person or topic within the field of [[pseudoscience]]. Occasionally the puzzle was presented in verse, and on Episode 96 it was presented as if by a fictional skeptical rapper Kom\u2019n Cents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927204827/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcastinfo.asp?pid=96|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-09-27|work=Official Skeptics' Guide Site|title=Episode 96}}</ref> Listeners would answer the puzzle via email or on the message board. Recognition (albeit no actual cash prize or gift) was given the following week to the first person to correctly answer the puzzle. The Skeptical puzzle has been discontinued since episode #130 to allow Evan to concentrate on other areas including SGU 5x5, though he has since occasionally offered a logic puzzle in lieu of \"Who's That Noisy?\".\n\n; This Day in History: Until 2015, the first segment after introductions was a description of a historical event of scientific or skeptical importance whose anniversary falls on the date of recording or the date the podcast is released.\n\n; \"Randi Speaks\": As of September 20, 2006, [[James Randi]] joined the podcast providing a pre-recorded commentary segment called \"Randi Speaks\". Randi, a professional magician and skeptic, expounds upon a topic on his mind for that week which may or may not have to do with skeptical matters. The segment disappeared for a period but returned for the August 8, 2007 episode with a different format. Instead of Randi delivering a prepared essay, an SGU host asks Randi a question which Randi then answers and expands upon.\n\n; \"Name That Logical Fallacy\": Steven Novella regularly presents the panelists with a recent argument, usually of a pseudoscientific nature, that has either appeared in recent news or has been submitted by listeners for consideration. The panelists are challenged to point out the flaws in the presented argument, with specific references to any [[informal fallacy|logical fallacies]] employed. The segment debuted during Episode 40 but it is not featured in every show.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcast-042606.html |title= Episode 40 |work= Official Skeptics' Guide web site] |access-date= October 4, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924184634/http://www.theskepticsguide.org/skepticsguide/podcast-042606.html |archive-date= September 24, 2008 |url-status= dead }}</ref> Many of the fallacies named are taken from the show's \"Top 20 Logical Fallacies\" list.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theskepticsguide.org/logicalfallacies.asp | work = Official Skeptics' Guide web site] | title = Top 20 Logical Fallacies | last = Novella | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Novella | 7 =  | access-date = July 15, 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090126061244/http://theskepticsguide.org/logicalfallacies.asp | archive-date = January 26, 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n; \"Swindlers List\": Starting on May 21, 2011, Jay Novella talks about a particular scam he has discovered or been told about.

As Ali's army came back from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son and the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. The Corps was established in 1828 and a specialized school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.\nIn 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 regiments scattered all over Egypt. The regiments and their respective locations included:\n\n* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)\n* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)\n* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)\n* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)\n* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )\n* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)\n* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)\n* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===\nClot Bey mentioned in his book{{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army did not start according to the new system until after the army's return from the Greek War of Independence, because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the good [[France|French]] cavalry system and realized the importance of cavalry organization. After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and a number of European teachers prepared for this purpose.\n\nThe Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at [[Mourad Bey Palace]], which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organized by [[Monsieu Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry maneuvers and infantry movements.\n\nThe school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out maneuvers, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organizing the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the maneuvers they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>\n\n== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==\nAfter the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was totally controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it totally became a homeland defence.\nThe Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion]]s instead of [[Regiment]]s. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]\n\n== World War I ==\nIn [[World War I]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation were on the [[North Africa]]n and Arabian fronts.\n\n== Modernization ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}\nA few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established.

In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.'' The mechanization process went totally on the Egyptian Cavalry Corps where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armored Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanized.\n\n[[Category:Military of Egypt]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n{{Overly detailed|details=details of individual conflicts seem unimportant to the history of the article's subject|date=April 2020}}}}\nThe '''Egyptian Calvary Corps''' was the mounted corps of the Egyptian Army\n\n== Establishment ==\n[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali of Egypt and the Sudan]] created a strong standing army with modern weaponry, tactics, and training. As Ali's army came back from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son, the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps. In 1828, the Egyptian Cavalry Corps was established and a specialized school was founded in [[Giza]] to train Cavalry officers.\nIn 1839, the Cavalry Corps had a total of 15 Regiments scattered all over Egypt. These were:\n\n* 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (Latakia)\n* 2nd Guards Cavalry Regiment (Besan)\n* 1st Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n* 2nd Cavalry Regiment (Zanba)\n* 3rd Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 4th Cavalry Regiment (Adana)\n* 5th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria)\n* 6th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 7th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 8th Cavalry Regiment (Damascus)\n* 9th Cavalry Regiment (Alexandria )\n* 10th Cavalry Regiment (Acre)\n* 11th Cavalry Regiment (Kilis)\n* 12th Cavalry Regiment (Tarsus)\n* 13th Cavalry Regiment (Urfa)\n\n=== The Cavalry School in Giza ===\nClot Bey mentioned in his book{{Which|date=April 2020}} that the formation of the cavalry teams in the Egyptian army did not start according to the new system until after the army's return from the Greek War of Independence, because, during this war, Ibrahim Pasha had witnessed the good [[France|French]] cavalry system and realized the importance of cavalry organization. After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and a number of European teachers prepared for this purpose.\n\nThe Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at [[Mourad Bey Palace]], which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organized by [[Monsieu Varane]], who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire including Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and his subordinate in-training officers, who were learning about cavalry maneuvers and infantry movements.\n\nThe school used to follow the system of the [[Somme Military School]] in France, except for some minor modifications that were required by the local conditions.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} Young Egyptians and Turks graduated as officers of the Cavalry Corps.\n\n[[Auguste de Marmont|Marshal Marmon]] visited this school in 1834, and there were 360 trainees in it, and he admired it and wrote about it on his journey:<blockquote>\"When I saw these students in the field carrying out maneuvers, I imagined that I was in front of a line of the finest verses in our horses. While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organizing the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the maneuvers they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"</blockquote>\n\n== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==\nAfter the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military High Command was totally controlled by [[British Empire|British]] generals and was downsized until it totally became a homeland defence.\nThe Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion]]s instead of [[Regiment]]s. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]\n\n== World War I ==\nIn [[World War I]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought for the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participation were on the [[North Africa]]n and Arabian fronts.\n\n== Modernization ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Armored Corps}}\nA few years after World War I, Egypt ended the British Protectorate and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's administration began to modernize everything in the country including economy, military, education, etc. The military modernization was focused on mechanization, building new military schools and mobilizing more men & reestablishing units. In 1928, the corps' name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps.''

Therefore, Titus Livius did not have a [[cognomen]] (third name, i.e. family name), which was not unusual during the [[Roman Republic]]. About this, classical sources agree: [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] (''[[Epistulae Morales ad Lucilium|Ep.]]'' 100.9); [[Tacitus]] (''[[Annales (Tacitus)|Ann.]]'' IV.34.4); [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] (''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Ep.]]'' II.3.8); and [[Suetonius]] (''[[The Twelve Caesars#Claudius|Claud.]]'' 41.1) call him ''Titus Livius.''

There is a debate{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} about the year of his birth \u2013 either in 64 BC, or more likely, in 59 BC ([[#Dates|see below]]).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Livy |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of World History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100110341 |access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> At the time of his birth, his home city of Patavium was the second wealthiest on the Italian peninsula, and the largest in the province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy). Cisalpine Gaul was merged in [[Roman Italy|Italy proper]] during his lifetime and its inhabitants were given Roman citizenship by Julius Caesar. In his works, Livy often expressed his deep affection and pride for Patavium, and the city was well known for its conservative values in [[morality]] and politics.{{Sfn|Livy|1998|loc=ix}} \"He was by nature a recluse, mild in temperament and averse to violence; the restorative peace of his time gave him the opportunity to turn all his imaginative passion to the legendary and historical past of the country he loved.\"<ref>{{cite book|translator=[[Aubrey de S\u00e9lincourt]]|author=Livy|title=Livy: The History of Early Rome|year=1978|publisher=Easton Press|location=Norwalk, Connecticut|edition= Collector's|page=viii|author-link=Livy}}</ref>\n\nLivy's teenage years were during the 40s BC, when a period of [[Roman civil wars|numerous civil wars throughout the Roman world]] occurred. The governor of Cisalpine Gaul at the time, [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], tried to sway Patavium{{when|date=July 2017}} into supporting [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony)]], the leader of one of the warring factions. The wealthy citizens of Patavium refused to contribute money and arms to Asinius Pollio, and went into hiding. Pollio then attempted to bribe the slaves of those wealthy citizens to expose the whereabouts of their masters; his bribery did not work, and the citizens instead pledged their allegiance to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. It is therefore likely{{cn|date=July 2017}} that the Roman civil wars prevented Livy from pursuing a higher education in Rome or going on a tour of [[Greece]], which was common for adolescent males of the nobility at the time. Many years later, Asinius Pollio derisively commented on Livy's \"patavinity\", saying that Livy's Latin showed certain \"provincialisms\" frowned on at Rome. Pollio's dig may have been the result of bad feelings he harboured toward the city of Patavium from his experiences there during the civil wars.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = ix\u2013x}}\n\nLivy probably went to Rome in the 30s BC,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hazel|first=John|url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john|title=Who's Who in the Roman World|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|series=Who's Who Series|url-access=registration|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref> and it is likely that he spent a large amount of time in the city after this, although it may not have been his primary home. During his time in Rome, he was never a senator nor held a government position. His writings contain elementary mistakes on military matters, indicating that he probably never served in the [[Roman army]]. However, he was educated in philosophy and rhetoric. It seems that Livy had the financial resources and means to live an independent life, though the origin of that wealth is unknown. He devoted a large part of his life to his writings, which he was able to do because of his financial freedom.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = x}}\n\nLivy was known to give recitations to small audiences, but he was not heard of to engage in [[declamation]], then a common pastime. He was familiar with the emperor [[Augustus]] and the imperial family. Augustus was considered by later Romans to have been the greatest Roman emperor, benefiting Livy's reputation long after his death. [[Suetonius]] described how Livy encouraged the future emperor [[Claudius]], who was born in 10 BC,<ref>{{cite-book|last=Payne|first=Robert|title=The Roman Triumph|publisher=Robert Hale|year=1962|isbn=|place=London|page=38|pages=}}</ref> to write historiographical works during his childhood.<ref>{{cite book|author=Suetonius|title=Claudius|series=[[The Twelve Caesars]]|at=41.1|quote=''Historiam in adulescentia hortante T.

In it he narrates a complete history of the city of Rome, from its foundation to the death of Augustus. Because he was writing under the reign of Augustus, Livy's history emphasizes the great triumphs of Rome. He wrote his history with embellished accounts of Roman heroism in order to promote the new type of government implemented by Augustus when he became emperor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dudley|first=Donald R|title=The Romans: 850 BC \u2013 AD 337|publisher=Alfred A.

When he began this work he was already past his youth; presumably, events in his life prior to that time had led to his intense activity as a historian. [[Seneca the Younger]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|first=|title=Moral Letters to Lucilius|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|at=100.9|quote=|author-link=Seneca the Younger}}</ref> gives brief mention that he was also known as an orator and philosopher and had written some treatises in those fields from a historical point of view.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">\"Livy wrote both dialogues, which should be ranked as history no less than as philosophy, and works which professedly deal with philosophy\" \n\n({{Lang|la|\"scripsit enim et dialogos, quos non magis philosophiae adnumerare possis quam historiae, et ex professo philosophiam continentis libros\"}}) \n\n\u2014[[Seneca the Younger]].

[[Pliny the Younger]] reported that Livy's celebrity was so widespread, a man from [[Cadiz]] travelled to Rome and back for the sole purpose of meeting him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pliny|title=Epistlae|at=II.3.|author-link=Pliny the Younger|title-link=Epistulae (Pliny)}}</ref> Livy's work was a source for the later works of [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], [[Florus]], [[Granius Licinianus]] and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Julius Obsequens]] used Livy, or a source with access to Livy, to compose his ''De Prodigiis'', an account of [[supernatural]] events in Rome from the consulship of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus|Scipio]] and [[Gaius Laelius|Laelius]] to that of Paulus Fabius and Quintus Aelius.{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\nLivy wrote during the reign of Augustus, who came to power after a civil war with generals and consuls claiming to be defending the [[Roman Republic]], such as [[Pompey]]. Patavium had been pro-Pompey. To clarify his status, the victor of the civil war, [[Octavian Caesar]], had wanted to take the title ''[[Romulus]]'' (the first king of Rome) but in the end accepted the senate proposal of ''Augustus''. Rather than abolishing the republic, he adapted it and its institutions to imperial rule.\n\nThe historian [[Tacitus]], writing about a century after Livy's time, described the Emperor Augustus as his friend.  Describing the trial of [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus|Cremutius Cordus]], Tacitus represents him as defending himself face-to-face with the frowning Tiberius as follows:\n\n{{quote |I am said to have praised [[Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy. Titus Livius, pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness, extolled [[Pompey|Cneius Pompeius]] in such a panegyric that Augustus called him Pompeianus, and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=Annales|at=IV.34|quote=Brutum et Cassium laudavisse dicor, quorum res gestas cum plurimi composuerint nemo sine honore memoravit.

Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit, ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret: neque id amicitiae eorum offecit.|author-link=Tacitus|title-link=Annales (Tacitus)}}</ref>}}\n\nLivy's reasons for returning to [[Padua]] after the death of Augustus (if he did) are unclear, but the circumstances of [[Tiberius]]' reign certainly allow for speculation.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Later===\n[[File:Briosco Titus Livius.jpg|thumb|Titus Livius by [[Andrea Riccio|Andrea Briosco]] ({{circa}} 1567)]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], interest in Livy declined because Western scholars were more focused on religious texts.{{Sfn|Foster|1919|p=24}} Due to the length of the work, the literate class was already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, that manuscripts began to be lost without replacement.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] was a time of intense revival; the population discovered that Livy's work was being lost and large amounts of money changed hands in the rush to collect Livian manuscripts. The poet [[Beccadelli]] sold a country home for funding to purchase one manuscript copied by [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio]].{{Sfn|Foster|1919|p=24}} [[Petrarch]] and [[Pope Nicholas V]] launched a search for the now missing books. [[Laurentius Valla]] published an amended text initiating the field of Livy scholarship. [[Dante]] speaks highly of him in his poetry, and [[Francis I of France]] commissioned extensive artwork treating Livian themes; [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s work on [[republic]]s, the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' is presented as a commentary on the ''History of Rome''. Respect for Livy rose to lofty heights. [[Walter Scott]] reports in [[Waverley (novel)|''Waverley'']] (1814) as an historical fact that a Scotchman involved in the first Jacobite uprising of 1715 was recaptured (and executed) because, having escaped, he yet lingered near the place of his captivity in \"the hope of recovering his favorite ''Titus Livius''.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Walter|title=Waverley|title-link=Waverley (novel)|publisher=[[Adam and Charles Black]]|year=1897|isbn=|location=London|page=570|pages=|chapter=6|author-link=Sir Walter Scott|orig-year=1814}}</ref>\n\n==Dates==\nLivy was likely born between 64 and 59 [[Before Christ|BC]] and died sometime between AD 12 to 17. He started his work sometime between 31 and 25 BC. [[St. Jerome]] says that Livy was born the same year as [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus]] and died the same year as [[Ovid]].<ref name=jerome/> Messala, however, was born earlier, in 64 BC, and Ovid's death, usually taken to be the same year as Livy's, is more uncertain. As an alternative view, [[Ronald Syme]] argues for 64 BC\u201312 AD as a range for Livy, setting the death of Ovid at 12.<ref>{{cite book|last=Livy|first=|title=Ab urbe condita|title-link=Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1994|isbn=0-521-41002-9|editor-last=Kraus|editor-first=Christina Shuttleworth|volume=Book VI|location=Cambridge|page=1|pages=}}</ref> A death date of 12 AD, however, removes Livy from Augustus' best years and makes him depart for Padua without the good reason of the second emperor, [[Tiberius]], being not as tolerant of his republicanism. The contradiction remains.\n\nThe authority supplying information from which possible vital data on Livy can be deduced is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], a [[bishop]] of the early [[Christian Church]]. One of his works was a summary of world history in [[ancient Greek]], termed the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronikon]],'' dating from the early 4th century AD. This work was lost except for fragments (mainly excerpts), but not before it had been translated in whole and in part by various authors such as [[St. Jerome]]. The entire work survives in two separate manuscripts, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and Greek (Christesen and Martirosova-Torlone 2006). St. Jerome wrote in Latin. Fragments in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] exist.{{Sfn|Fotheringham|1905|p=1}}\n\n[[Eusebius]]' work consists of two books: the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)#Contents|Chronographia]]'', a summary of history in annalist form, and the ''Chronikoi Kanones'', tables of years and events. St. Jerome translated the tables into Latin as the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'', probably adding some information of his own from unknown sources. Livy's dates appear in ''Jerome's Chronicon.''\n\nThe main problem with the information given in the [[manuscript]]s is that, between them, they often give different dates for the same events or different events, do not include the same material entirely, and reformat what they do include. A date may be in ''Ab Urbe Condita'' or in [[Olympiad]]s or in some other form, such as age. These variations may have occurred through scribal error or scribal license. Some material has been inserted under the aegis of [[Eusebius]].\n\nThe topic of manuscript variants is a large and specialized one, on which authors of works on Livy seldom care to linger. As a result, standard information in a standard rendition is used, which gives the impression of a standard set of dates for Livy. There are no such dates.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A typical presumption is of a birth in the 2nd year of the 180th Olympiad and a death in the first year of the 199th Olympiad, which are coded 180.2 and 199.1 respectively.<ref name=\"jerome\">{{cite web|url=http://www.attalus.org/translate/jerome2.html|title=St. Jerome (Hieronymus): Chronological Tables|last=|first=|date=29 February 2016|work=Attalus|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=14 August 2009}}</ref> All sources use the same first [[Olympiad]], 776/775\u2013773/772 BC by the modern calendar.

He wrote a monumental history of [[Rome]] and the Roman people, ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri]]'' (''Books from the Founding of the City''), covering the period from the earliest legends of Rome before the traditional foundation in 753 BC through the reign of [[Augustus]] in Livy's own lifetime. He was on familiar terms with members of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] and even in friendship with Augustus,<ref>{{cite-book|author=[[Tacitus]]|title=[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]|at=IV.34.}}</ref> whose young grandnephew, the future emperor [[Claudius]], he exhorted to take up the writing of history.<ref>{{cite book|author=Suetonius|title=Claudius|series=[[The Twelve Caesars]]|at=41.1.|author-link=Suetonius|title-link=The Twelve Caesars#Claudius}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nLivy was born in Patavium in northern [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]], now modern [[Padua]]. There is a debate{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} about the year of his birth \u2013 either in 64 BC, or more likely, in 59 BC ([[#Dates|see below]]).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Livy |encyclopedia=A Dictionary of World History |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2015 |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100110341 |access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> At the time of his birth, his home city of Patavium was the second wealthiest on the Italian peninsula, and the largest in the province of [[Cisalpine Gaul]] (northern Italy). Cisalpine Gaul was merged in [[Roman Italy|Italy proper]] during his lifetime and its inhabitants were given Roman citizenship by Julius Caesar. In his works, Livy often expressed his deep affection and pride for Patavium, and the city was well known for its conservative values in [[morality]] and politics.{{Sfn|Livy|1998|loc=ix}} \"He was by nature a recluse, mild in temperament and averse to violence; the restorative peace of his time gave him the opportunity to turn all his imaginative passion to the legendary and historical past of the country he loved.\"<ref>{{cite book|translator=[[Aubrey de S\u00e9lincourt]]|author=Livy|title=Livy: The History of Early Rome|year=1978|publisher=Easton Press|location=Norwalk, Connecticut|edition= Collector's|page=viii|author-link=Livy}}</ref>\n\nLivy's teenage years were during the 40s BC, when a period of [[Roman civil wars|numerous civil wars throughout the Roman world]] occurred. The governor of Cisalpine Gaul at the time, [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], tried to sway Patavium{{when|date=July 2017}} into supporting [[Mark Antony|Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony)]], the leader of one of the warring factions. The wealthy citizens of Patavium refused to contribute money and arms to Asinius Pollio, and went into hiding. Pollio then attempted to bribe the slaves of those wealthy citizens to expose the whereabouts of their masters; his bribery did not work, and the citizens instead pledged their allegiance to the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. It is therefore likely{{cn|date=July 2017}} that the Roman civil wars prevented Livy from pursuing a higher education in Rome or going on a tour of [[Greece]], which was common for adolescent males of the nobility at the time. Many years later, Asinius Pollio derisively commented on Livy's \"patavinity\", saying that Livy's Latin showed certain \"provincialisms\" frowned on at Rome. Pollio's dig may have been the result of bad feelings he harboured toward the city of Patavium from his experiences there during the civil wars.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = ix\u2013x}}\n\nLivy probably went to Rome in the 30s BC<ref>{{cite book|last=Hazel|first=John|title=Who's Who in the Roman World|url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoinromanwo00john|url-access=registration|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|series=Who's Who Series|via=EBSCOhost}}</ref>, and it is likely that he spent a large amount of time in the city after this, although it may not have been his primary home. During his time in Rome, he was never a senator nor held a government position. His writings contain elementary mistakes on military matters, indicating that he probably never served in the [[Roman army]]. However, he was educated in philosophy and rhetoric. It seems that Livy had the financial resources and means to live an independent life, though the origin of that wealth is unknown. He devoted a large part of his life to his writings, which he was able to do because of his financial freedom.{{Sfn | Livy | 1998 | loc = x}}\n\nLivy was known to give recitations to small audiences, but he was not heard of to engage in [[declamation]], then a common pastime. He was familiar with the emperor [[Augustus]] and the imperial family. Augustus was considered by later Romans to have been the greatest Roman emperor, benefiting Livy's reputation long after his death. [[Suetonius]] described how Livy encouraged the future emperor [[Claudius]], who was born in 10 BC, to write historiographical works during his childhood.<ref>{{cite book|author=Suetonius|title=Claudius|series=[[The Twelve Caesars]]|at=41.1|quote=''Historiam in adulescentia hortante T.

In it he narrates a complete history of the city of Rome, from its foundation to the death of Augustus. Because he was writing under the reign of Augustus, Livy's history emphasizes the great triumphs of Rome.<ref>{{cite-book | first = Robert | last = Payne | title = The Roman Triumph | place = London | publisher = Robert hale | year = 1962 | page = 38}}.</ref> He wrote his history with embellished accounts of Roman heroism in order to promote the new type of government implemented by Augustus when he became emperor.<ref>{{cite book | first = Donald R | last = Dudley | title = The Romans: 850 BC \u2013 AD 337 | place = New York | publisher = Alfred A.

When he began this work he was already past his youth; presumably, events in his life prior to that time had led to his intense activity as a historian. [[Seneca the Younger]] gives brief mention that he was also known as an orator and philosopher and had written some treatises in those fields from a historical point of view.<ref>{{cite book|author=Seneca the Younger|title=Moral Letters to Lucilius|at=100.9|quote=Livy wrote both dialogues, which should be ranked as history no less than as philosophy, and works which professedly deal with philosophy}} (''scripsit enim et dialogos, quos non magis philosophiae adnumerare possis quam historiae, et ex professo philosophiam continentis libros'').</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Imperial era===\nLivy's ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|History of Rome]]'' was in high demand from the time it was published and remained so during the early years of the empire. [[Pliny the Younger]] reported that Livy's celebrity was so widespread, a man from [[Cadiz]] travelled to Rome and back for the sole purpose of meeting him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pliny|title=Epistlae|at=II.3.|author-link=Pliny the Younger|title-link=Epistulae (Pliny)}}</ref>  Livy's work was a source for the later works of [[Aurelius Victor]], [[Cassiodorus]], [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], [[Florus]], [[Granius Licinianus]] and [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]]. [[Julius Obsequens]] used Livy, or a source with access to Livy, to compose his ''De Prodigiis'', an account of [[supernatural]] events in Rome from the consulship of [[Lucius Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus|Scipio]] and [[Gaius Laelius|Laelius]] to that of Paulus Fabius and Quintus Aelius.{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n\nLivy wrote during the reign of Augustus, who came to power after a civil war with generals and consuls claiming to be defending the [[Roman Republic]], such as [[Pompey]]. Patavium had been pro-Pompey. To clarify his status, the victor of the civil war, [[Octavian Caesar]], had wanted to take the title ''[[Romulus]]'' (the first king of Rome) but in the end accepted the senate proposal of ''Augustus''. Rather than abolishing the republic, he adapted it and its institutions to imperial rule.\n\nThe historian [[Tacitus]], writing about a century after Livy's time, described the Emperor Augustus as his friend.  Describing the trial of [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus|Cremutius Cordus]], Tacitus represents him as defending himself face-to-face with the frowning Tiberius as follows:\n\n{{quote |I am said to have praised [[Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]], whose careers many have described and no one mentioned without eulogy. Titus Livius, pre-eminently famous for eloquence and truthfulness, extolled [[Pompey|Cneius Pompeius]] in such a panegyric that Augustus called him Pompeianus, and yet this was no obstacle to their friendship.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tacitus|title=Annales|at=IV.34|quote=Brutum et Cassium laudavisse dicor, quorum res gestas cum plurimi composuerint nemo sine honore memoravit.

Pompeium tantis laudibus tulit, ut Pompeianum eum Augustus appellaret: neque id amicitiae eorum offecit.|author-link=Tacitus|title-link=Annales (Tacitus)}}</ref>}}\n\nLivy's reasons for returning to [[Padua]] after the death of Augustus (if he did) are unclear, but the circumstances of [[Tiberius]]' reign certainly allow for speculation.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Later===\n[[File:Briosco Titus Livius.jpg|thumb|Titus Livius by [[Andrea Riccio|Andrea Briosco]] ({{circa}} 1567)]]\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], interest in Livy declined because Western scholars were more focused on religious texts.{{Sfn|Foster|1919|p=24}} Due to the length of the work, the literate class was already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, that manuscripts began to be lost without replacement.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] was a time of intense revival; the population discovered that Livy's work was being lost and large amounts of money changed hands in the rush to collect Livian manuscripts. The poet [[Beccadelli]] sold a country home for funding to purchase one manuscript copied by [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini|Poggio]].{{Sfn|Foster|1919|p=24}} [[Petrarch]] and [[Pope Nicholas V]] launched a search for the now missing books. [[Laurentius Valla]] published an amended text initiating the field of Livy scholarship. [[Dante]] speaks highly of him in his poetry, and [[Francis I of France]] commissioned extensive artwork treating Livian themes; [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s work on [[republic]]s, the ''[[Discourses on Livy]]'' is presented as a commentary on the ''History of Rome''. Respect for Livy rose to lofty heights. [[Walter Scott]] reports in [[Waverley (novel)|''Waverley'']] (1814) as an historical fact that a Scotchman involved in the first Jacobite uprising of 1715 was recaptured (and executed) because, having escaped, he yet lingered near the place of his captivity in \"the hope of recovering his favorite ''Titus Livius''.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Walter |author-link=Sir Walter Scott |title=Waverley |chapter=6 |publisher=[[Adam and Charles Black]] |year=1897 |orig-year=First published 1814|page=570|title-link=Waverley (novel) }}</ref>\n\n==Dates==\nLivy was likely born between 64 and 59 B.C. and died sometime between A.D. 12 to 17. He started his work sometime between 31 B.C. and 25 B.C. [[St. Jerome]] says that Livy was born the same year as [[Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus]] and died the same year as [[Ovid]].<ref name=jerome/> Messala, however, was born earlier, in 64 BC, and Ovid's death, usually taken to be the same year as Livy's, is more uncertain. As an alternative view, [[Ronald Syme]] argues for 64 BC \u2013 12 AD as a range for Livy, setting the death of Ovid at 12.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ab vrbe condita |volume=Book VI |last=Livy |editor-first=Christina Shuttleworth |editor-last=Kraus |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |year=1994 |isbn=0-521-41002-9 |page=1|title-link=Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy) }}</ref> A death date of 12, however, removes Livy from Augustus' best years and makes him depart for Padua without the good reason of the second emperor, [[Tiberius]], being not as tolerant of his republicanism. The contradiction remains.\n\nThe authority supplying information from which possible vital data on Livy can be deduced is [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], a [[bishop]] of the early [[Christian Church]]. One of his works was a summary of world history in [[ancient Greek]], termed the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronikon]],'' dating from the early 4th century AD. This work was lost except for fragments (mainly excerpts), but not before it had been translated in whole and in part by various authors such as [[St. Jerome]]. The entire work survives in two separate manuscripts, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and Greek (Christesen and Martirosova-Torlone 2006). St. Jerome wrote in Latin. Fragments in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] exist.{{Sfn|Fotheringham|1905|p=1}}\n\n[[Eusebius]]' work consists of two books: the ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)#Contents|Chronographia]]'', a summary of history in annalist form, and the ''Chronikoi Kanones'', tables of years and events. St. Jerome translated the tables into Latin as the ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'', probably adding some information of his own from unknown sources. Livy's dates appear in ''Jerome's Chronicon.''\n\nThe main problem with the information given in the [[manuscript]]s is that, between them, they often give different dates for the same events or different events, do not include the same material entirely, and reformat what they do include. A date may be in ''Ab Urbe Condita'' or in [[Olympiad]]s or in some other form, such as age. These variations may have occurred through scribal error or scribal license. Some material has been inserted under the aegis of [[Eusebius]].\n\nThe topic of manuscript variants is a large and specialized one, on which authors of works on Livy seldom care to linger. As a result, standard information in a standard rendition is used, which gives the impression of a standard set of dates for Livy. There are no such dates.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} A typical presumption is of a birth in the 2nd year of the 180th Olympiad and a death in the first year of the 199th Olympiad, which are coded 180.2 and 199.1 respectively.<ref name= jerome>{{cite web |title=St. Jerome (Hieronymus): Chronological Tables \u2013 for Olympiads 170 to 203 [= 100 BC \u2013 36 AD] |url=http://www.attalus.org/translate/jerome2.html |work=Attalus |access-date=14 August 2009 |date=29 February 2016}}</ref> All sources use the same first [[Olympiad]], 776/775\u2013773/772 BC by the modern calendar.
