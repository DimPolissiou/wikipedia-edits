Having spent the majority of his career at [[Real Madrid]], Casillas is one of the few players to achieve over [[List of footballers with the most official appearances|1000 professional career matches]], and holds the record for the most clean sheets in the [[UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions league]], as well as for the [[Spain national football team|Spanish national team]].\n\nAt club level, Casillas started his career with the [[Real Madrid CF (youth)|Real Madrid youth team]], eventually gaining promotion to the main team in 1999, where he became the youngest goalkeeper to play in the final of the Champions league, and to win the title, at 19 years and four days. Casillas became the first choice goalkeeper at Real Madrid, winning 2 champions leagues and la Liga titles in his first three seasons, establishing himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. During his highly successful career in Madrid, Casillas won all major club titles, including five [[La Liga]] titles, four [[Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey]] titles, three [[UEFA Champions League|Champions leagues]], two [[UEFA Super Cup]]s, one [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]]. After 25 years with Real Madrid, Casillas joined FC Porto in 2015 on a free transfer, where he won the [[2017\u201318 Primeira Liga|Primeira Liga]] and a [[2018 Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira|Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira]] title. While at Porto, he broke the record for most consecutive seasons played in the champions league (20) and amassed the most appearances in the competition (177).\n\nWith 167 international caps, Casillas has the second most appearances for the Spanish national team, making him the joint tenth-[[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|most capped footballer of all time]]. Becoming the nation's first choice goalkeeper at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], Casillas went on to play at [[UEFA Euro 2004]] and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. In 2008, he was made [[List of Spain national football captains|captain]], and led the team to that year's [[UEFA Euro 2008|European Championship]]. Casillas also led Spain to their first [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup win in 2010]], where he kept a record five clean sheets, winning the [[Yashin Award]] for best goalkeeper of the tournament. Spain became the first nation to retain the European Championship, winning again in [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], where he set the record for [[List of UEFA European Championship records and statistics|most consecutive minutes without conceding a goal]] in the competition (509). In 2014, Casillas became one of four players to [[List of players who have appeared in multiple FIFA World Cups|represent Spain at four World Cups]].\n\nIn 2008, Casillas placed Fourth overall in the [[Ballon d'Or]], and has been selected for the [[UEFA Team of the Year|UEFA Team of the year]] six consecutive times from 2007 to 2012, a record for a goalkeeper. Casillas was also selected in the [[FIFPro World XI|FIFPro world XI]] a record 5 times for a goalkeeper, and was named as the [[IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper]] a record 5 times, alongside [[Gianluigi Buffon]].
