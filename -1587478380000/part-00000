The show is presented by [[Piotr G\u0105sowski]] and Maciej Dowbor, whilst the judging panel consists of Kacper Kuszewski, [[Ma\u0142gorzata Walewska]], Adam Strycharczuk and [[Katarzyna Skrzynecka]].\n\nThe show involves eight celebrities (singers, actors and television personalities) portraying various iconic singers each week to win 10,000 PLN for their chosen charity.\n\n==Format==\nThe show challenges celebrities (singers and actors) to impersonate different music artists every week, which are chosen by the show's \"Randomiser\". Afterwards they are judged by the panel of celebrity judges. The 'randomiser' can choose any older or younger artist available in the machine, or even a singer of the opposite sex, or a deceased singer. The winner of each episode wins 10,000 PLN, and the winner of the whole show wins 100,000 PLN. All money goes for a charity of their choice.\n\n===Voting===\nThe contestants are awarded points from the judges (and each other) based on their singing and dance routines. The points go from 1 to 7 and 10, with 10 being the judge's favorite of the night. After that, each contestant gives 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice (known as \"Bonus\" points). The judges' score is combined with the \"Bonus\" points.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Hosts===\n;Key\n:{{Color box|orange|border=darkgray}} Main host\n:{{Color box|lightblue|border=darkgray}} Contestant\n:{{Color box|#ffc6c6|border=darkgray}} Back-up host\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

series. The show is presented by [[Piotr G\u0105sowski]] and Maciej Dowbor, whilst the judging panel consists of Kacper Kuszewski, [[Ma\u0142gorzata Walewska]], Adam Strycharczuk and [[Katarzyna Skrzynecka]].\n\nThe show involves eight celebrities (singers, actors and television personalities) portraying various iconic singers each week to win 10,000 PLN for their chosen charity.\n\n==Format==\nThe show challenges celebrities (singers and actors) to impersonate different music artists every week, which are chosen by the show's \"Randomiser\". Afterwards they are judged by the panel of celebrity judges. The 'randomiser' can choose any older or younger artist available in the machine, or even a singer of the opposite sex, or a deceased singer. The winner of each episode wins 10,000 PLN, and the winner of the whole show wins 100,000 PLN. All money goes for a charity of their choice.\n\n===Voting===\nThe contestants are awarded points from the judges (and each other) based on their singing and dance routines. The points go from 1 to 7 and 10, with 10 being the judge's favorite of the night. After that, each contestant gives 5 points to a fellow contestant of their choice (known as \"Bonus\" points). The judges' score is combined with the \"Bonus\" points.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Hosts===\n;Key\n:{{Color box|orange|border=darkgray}} Main host\n:{{Color box|lightblue|border=darkgray}} Contestant\n:{{Color box|#ffc6c6|border=darkgray}} Back-up host\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

The bridges were designed by engineering staff of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and built in 1870 by day labour. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1064>{{cite NSW SHR|5012261|Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|hr=01064|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBy the early 1900s the original single track from [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nNormally the {{convert|6.1|m|ft|0|adj=on}} clear span would have been bridged by a simple steel plate web girder, but the shortage of steel meant a continuance of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nThis bridge is easily accessible via Springvale Lane which is off the [[Mudgee]] Road, south-east of the [[Wallerawang Power Station]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is a significant technical accomplishment. It has seventeen stone arch [[Span (architecture)|spans]] totalling {{convert|139.6|m|ft|0}} and is the longest masonry arch bridge ever built in Australia. Its main span of {{convert|16.5|m|ft|0}} is also large, being the fifth longest of its type for its age (1870). It is also unusual in having an elliptical arch rib. The main span is flanked by stone [[buttress]]es or [[columns]] which extend above the deck. The treatment of the [[spandrel]] is unusual in that the radial joints of the arch rib are extended out to fill the entire spandrel space The bridge is thus an integral part of a section of the New South Wales rail system of immense historical significance.<ref name=RNE>Register of the National Estate.</ref>\n\nThe brick double track underbridge over Coxs River, 1923.<ref name=nswshr-1064/><ref name=RNE/>\n\nThe bridge retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 March 2006, this 1870 bridge is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with [[John Whitton]] the \"father of New South Wales railways\", it is an impressive sandstone structure on the outskirts of historic Wallerawang, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and the extension west to Wallerawang.

The bridges were designed by engineering staff of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and built in 1870 by day labour. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1064>{{cite NSW SHR|5012261|Wallerawang rail bridges over Cox's River|hr=01064|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nBy the early 1900s the original single track from [[Bowenfels, New South Wales|Bowenfels]] to Wallerawang was inadequate for railway operations so plans were made to duplicate that section of line and at the same time ease the grades and flatten some curves.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nA major programme of similar works was begun in 1910 and continued until the mid 1920s but, because steel was an expensive import from Britain, the dominant material for bridging the many waterways was bricks, mostly from the 1912 State Brickworks at [[Homebush, New South Wales|Homebush]] and mostly in the form of brick arch culverts and viaducts.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The quantity of bricks used in the programme was enormous and the period could be aptly described as the \"era of the brick arch\".<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nNormally the {{convert|6.1|m|ft|0|adj=on}} clear span would have been bridged by a simple steel plate web girder, but the shortage of steel meant a continuance of brick arch construction.<ref name=nswshr-1064/> The Bowenfels to Wallerawang work was delayed until after [[World War I]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\nThis bridge is easily accessible via Springvale Lane which is off the [[Mudgee]] Road, south-east of the [[Wallerawang Power Station]].<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Description ==\nThe bridge is a significant technical accomplishment. It has seventeen stone arch [[Span (architecture)|spans]] totalling {{convert|139.6|m|ft|0}} and is the longest masonry arch bridge ever built in Australia. Its main span of {{convert|16.5|m|ft|0}} is also large, being the fifth longest of its type for its age (1870). It is also unusual in having an elliptical arch rib. The main span is flanked by stone [[buttress]]es or [[columns]] which extend above the deck. The treatment of the [[spandrel]] is unusual in that the radial joints of the arch rib are extended out to fill the entire spandrel space The bridge is thus an integral part of a section of the New South Wales rail system of immense historical significance.<ref name=RNE>Register of the National Estate.</ref>\n\nThe brick double track underbridge over Coxs River, 1923.<ref name=nswshr-1064/><ref name=RNE/>\n\nThe bridge retains its original fabric.<ref name=nswshr-1064/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 15 March 2006, this 1870 bridge is significant because it is one the oldest stone arch railway viaducts in New South Wales. It is associated with [[John Whitton]] the \"father of New South Wales railways\", it is an impressive sandstone structure on the outskirts of historic Wallerawang, its construction contributed significantly to the subsequent railway extension to [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and on to western New South Wales and when John Whitton was denied funds to continue with the expensive wrought iron girder bridges he chose the stone arch viaduct for his major bridge works, particularly for the Zig Zag east of [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]] and the extension west to Wallerawang. It is the largest of Whitton's stone arch viaducts.

He was named after his uncle and godfather, Duke [[Georg, Duke of Saxony|Georg the Bearded]] of Saxony, who had married the younger sister of George's mother.  As a child, George spent time at the court of his uncle and godfather in Saxony, which resulted in a lifetime friendship.\n\nGeorge essentially continued the policies of his father.  He worked energetically on limiting the power of the cities and the nobility. He pursued a policy of limiting the suzerainty of Brandenburg. In 1493 he concluded with Elector [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg|John Cicero]] the [[Treaty of Pyritz]] by which Pomerania was to gain [[imperial immediacy]] within the Holy Roman Empire, of the same rank as Brandenburg, which again received the succession in Pomerania once the ducal house would become extinct in the male line. However, when - unlike as expected - the duke successfully procreated - John Cicero intrigued against Pomerania gaining imperial recognition as imperial estate. \n\nAfter he and his brother [[Barnim XI, Duke of Pomerania|Barnim IX]] took up government jointly, George showed an interest in the efforts of the [[Reformation]], yet he personally remained faithful to the Catholic church. George was introduced to government by his father at an early age.  In 1520 he was already active at the court of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and participated in the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 and the Diet of [[Nuremberg]] in 1523.\n\nWhen in 1524 a military conflict threatened with Brandenburg, George crafted an alliance with King [[Sigismund I of Poland]], which was directed against Brandenburg and Duke [[Albert of Prussia]] and against the followers of the Reformation.  Nevertheless, he failed to suppress the Reformation in his country; he could in the end only steer it onto moderate tracks.\n\nAfter the [[First Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 he tried to approach Brandenburg. Due to Brandenburg claims and the refusal of the Pomeranian estates to cooperate, the negotiations took until 1529. In the meantime, Brandenburg once again threatened to resolve the conflict using its military. But on 26 August 1529, a compromise was struck, the [[Treaty of Grimnitz]], with Elector [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim I]] of Brandenburg thanks to the mediation of the Dukes [[Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Eric I]] of Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen-Calenberg and [[Henry II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Henry the Younger]] of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. George would marry Joachim's daughter [[Margaret of Brandenburg]] and Brandenburg would recognise Pomerania's imperial immediacy.\n\nDomestically, a dispute with his brother Barnim IX, who wanted to divide the country, began after the Treaty of Grimnitz had been ratified.  A large part of the Estates backed Barnim because they feared that once George had resolved the dispute with Brandenburg, he would turn his efforts against the reformation, and also because they were hoping that Barnim might be easier to influence than George.  The situation changed somewhat after George died, aged 38, at [[Szczecin|Stettin]], as his son and successor [[Philip I, Duke of Pomerania|Philip I]], joined the Reformation.  Nevertheless, the country was split into Pomerania-Wolgast (ruled by Philip I) and Pomerania-Szczecin (ruled by Barnim IX).\n\n== Marriages and issue ==\nGeorge I was married twice.

He was named after his uncle and godfather, Duke [[Georg, Duke of Saxony|Georg the Bearded]] of Saxony, who had married the younger sister of George's mother.  As a child, George spent time at the court of his uncle and godfather in Saxony, which resulted in a lifetime friendship.\n\nGeorge essentially continued the policies of his father.  He worked energetically on limiting the power of the cities and the nobility. He pursued a policy of limiting the suzerainty of Brandenburg. In 1493 he concluded with Elector [[John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg|John Cicero]] the [[Treaty of Pyritz]] by which Pomerania was to gain [[imperial immediacy]] within the Holy Roman Empire, of the same rank as Brandenburg, which again received the succession in Pomerania once the ducal house would become extinct in the male line. However, when - unlike as expected - the duke successfully procreated - John Cicero intrigued against Pomerania gaining imperial recognition as imperial estate. \n\nAfter he and his brother [[Barnim XI, Duke of Pomerania|Barnim IX]] took up government jointly, George showed an interest in the efforts of the [[Reformation]], yet he personally remained faithful to the Catholic church. George was introduced to government by his father at an early age.  In 1520 he was already active at the court of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and participated in the [[Diet of Worms]] in 1521 and the Diet of [[Nuremberg]] in 1523.\n\nWhen in 1524 a military conflict threatened with Brandenburg, George crafted an alliance with King [[Sigismund I of Poland]], which was directed against Brandenburg and Duke [[Albert of Prussia]] and against the followers of the Reformation.  Nevertheless, he failed to suppress the Reformation in his country; he could in the end only steer it onto moderate tracks.\n\nAfter the [[First Diet of Speyer|Diet of Speyer]] in 1526 he tried to approach Brandenburg. Due to Brandenburg claims and the refusal of the Pomeranian estates to cooperate, the negotiations took until 1529. In the meantime, Brandenburg once again threatened to resolve the conflict using its military. But on 26 August 1529, a compromise was struck, the [[Treaty of Grimnitz]], with Elector [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim I]] of Brandenburg thanks to the mediation of the Dukes [[Eric I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg|Eric I]] of Brunswick-G\u00f6ttingen-Calenberg and [[Henry II, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Henry the Younger]] of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. George would marry Joachim's daughter [[Margaret of Brandenburg]] and Brandenburg would recognise Pomerania's imperial immediacy.\n\nDomestically, a dispute with his brother Barnim IX, who wanted to divide the country, began after the Treaty of Grimnitz had been ratified.  A large part of the Estates backed Barnim because they feared that once George had resolved the dispute with Brandenburg, he would turn his efforts against the reformation, and also because they were hoping that Barnim might be easier to influence than George.  The situation changed somewhat after George died, aged 38, at [[Szczecin|Stettin]], as his son and successor [[Philip I, Duke of Pomerania|Philip I]], joined the Reformation.  Nevertheless, the country was split into Pomerania-Wolgast (ruled by Philip I) and Pomerania-Szczecin (ruled by Barnim IX).\n\n== Marriages and issue ==\nGeorge I was married twice. In his first marriage, he married [[Amalie of the Palatinate|Amalie]] (1490\u20131524), daughter of Elector Palatine [[Philip, Elector Palatine|Philip]] and Margaret of Bavaria.  They had the following children:\n* Bogislaw XI (1514-1514)\n* [[Philip I, Duke of Pomerania|Philip I]] (1515\u20131560) married to Maria of Saxony\n* Margaret (1518\u20131569), married Duke [[Ernest III, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen|Ernest III]] of Brunswick-Grubenhagen\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Cranach the Younger Portrait of Philip I of Pomerania.jpg|Portrait of Philip I of Pomerania by Lucas Cranach the Younger\nFile:Maria of Saxony, Duchess of Pomerania.jpg|Maria of Saxony, by Lucas Cranach the Elder\nFile:Ernest III de Brunswick-Grubenhagen 04110.JPG|Ernest III, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen by Cranach\nFile:Cranach the Elder Margaret of Pomerania.jpg|Princess Margaret of Pomerania-Wolgast (1518\u20131569) by Lucas Cranach the Elder\n</gallery>\n\nHis second wife was [[Margarete of Brandenburg (1511\u20131577)|Margarete of Brandenburg]] (1511\u20131577), daughter of Elector [[Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim]] of Brandenburg and [[Elizabeth of Denmark, Electress of Brandenburg|Elizabeth of Denmark]].
