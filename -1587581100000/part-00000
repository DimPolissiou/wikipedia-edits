The party landed at [[Cook Inlet]] in late May, then traveled east, paralleling the [[Alaska Range]], before reaching the slopes of Denali in early August. Camped on the flank of the mountain on August 3, Brooks noted later that while \"the ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part of our plans,\" the party decided to delay one day so \"that we might actually set foot on the slopes of the mountain.\" Setting off alone, with good weather, on August 4, Brooks aimed to reach a 10,000&nbsp;ft shoulder. At 7,500&nbsp;ft, Brooks found his way blocked by sheer ice and, after leaving a small cairn as a marker, descended.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/dena1/history.pdf|title=A History of Mount McKinley National Park|last=Pearson|first=Grant|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=9\u201312}}</ref> After the party's return, Brooks co-authored a \"Plan For Climbing Mt McKinley,\" published in ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine in January, 1903, with fellow party-member and topographer D.L.

The group attempted to get as close to the mountain as possible via the [[Kantishna River|Kantishna river]] by [[Steamboat|steamer]], before offloading and following Chitsia Creek with a poling boat, mules and backpacks, a route suggested to them by [[Tanana Athabaskans|Tanana Athabaskan]] people they met along the way. The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali. On reaching the mountain, the mountaineers set up base camp on the lower portion of [[Peters Glacier (Alaska Range)|Peters Glacier]]. Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali's north peak, they attempted to ascend directly, however crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via [[Jeffery Glacier]] where they believed they could see a way to the summit. After a dangerous ascent, at around 10,000&nbsp;ft, Wickersham found that the route did not connect as it had appeared from below, instead discovering \"a tremendous precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible.\" This wall, now known as the [[Wickersham Wall]], juts 14,000&nbsp;ft upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/dena/hrs3.htm|title=Denali NP: Historic Resource Study (Chapter 3)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> Because of the route's history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=139}}\n\nLater in the summer of 1903, Dr. [[Frederick Cook]] led a team of five men on another attempt at the summit.

Cook approached the mountain via the Peters Glacier, as Wickersham had done, however he was able to overcome the ice fall that had caused the previous group to turn up the spur towards the Wickersham Wall. Despite avoiding this obstacle, on August 31, having reached an elevation of about 10,900 ft on the northwest buttress of the north peak, the party found they had reached a dead end and could make no further progress. On the descent, the group completely circumnavigated the mountain, the first climbing party to do so.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Mount McKinley: Icy Crown of North America|last=Beckey|first=Fred|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|year=1993|isbn=9780898866469|location=|pages=295}}</ref>  Although Cook's 1903 expedition did not reach the summit, he received acclaim for the accomplishment, a 1000 mile trek in which he not only circled the entire mountain but also found, on the descent, an accessible pass northeast of the [[Muldrow Glacier]] following the headwaters of the [[Toklat River|Toklat]] and [[Chulitna River (Susitna River)|Chulitna]] rivers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1906, Cook launched another expedition to Denali with co-leader [[Herschel Parker]], a [[Columbia University]] professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience. Belmore Browne, an experienced climber and five other men comprised the rest of the group. Cook and Parker's group spent the bulk of the summer season exploring the southern and southeastern approaches to the mountain, eventually reaching a high point on [[Tokositna Glacier|Tokositna glacier]], 25 miles from the summit.<ref name=\":3\" /> During their explorations the party mapped out many of the tributaries and glaciers of the [[Susitna River|Susitna river]] along the mountain's south flank.<ref name=\":0\" />  As the summer ended, the team retreated to the coast and began to disperse. In September 1906, Cook and a single party-member, horseman Robert Barrill, struck out towards the summit again, in what Cook later described as \"a last desperate attempt\" in a telegram to his financial backers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cook and Barrill spent 12 days in total on the attempt, and claimed to have reached the summit via the [[Ruth Glacier]].<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nUpon hearing Cook's claims, Parker and Browne were immediately suspicious. Browne later wrote that he knew Cook's claims were lies, just as \"any New Yorker would know that no man could walk from the Brooklyn Bridge to Grant's Tomb [a distance of eight miles] in ten minutes.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In May 1907, ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' published Cook's account of the climb along with a photograph of what appeared to be Barrill standing on the summit. By 1909, Barrill had recanted at least part of his story about the climb, and others publicly questioned the account, however Cook continued to assert his claim<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/projects/frederick-cook/controversy.html|title=Controversy - Frederick A. Cook Digital Exhibition|website=library.osu.edu|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>  The controversy continued for decades. In 1956, mountaineers [[Bradford Washburn]] and Walter Gonnason tried to settle the matter, with Gonnason attempting to follow Cook's purported route to the summit. Washburn noted inconsistencies between Cook's account of locations of glaciers and found a spot, at 5,400 ft and 19 miles southeast of the summit that appeared identical to the supposed summit image. Gonnason was not able to complete the climb, but because he was turned back by poor weather, felt that this did not definitely disprove Cook's story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4017660/mount-mckinley-denali-ascent-hoax/|title=The Other Mount McKinley Controversy: Who Climbed Denali First|last=Berman|first=Eliza|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In 1998, historian Robert Bryce discovered an original and un-cropped version of the \"fake peak\" photograph of Barrill standing on the promontory.

The group spent approximately three months on the mountain.  Their purported summit ascent day included carrying a bag of doughnuts each, a thermos of hot chocolate, and a 14-foot (4.2 m) spruce pole.  Two of them reached the North Summit, the lower of the two, and erected the pole near the top. According to the group, the time they took to reach the summit was a total of 18 hours.  Until the first ascent in 1913, their claims were disbelieved, in part due to false claims they had climbed both summits.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nIn 1912, the [[Herschel Clifford Parker|Parker]]-Browne expedition nearly reached the summit, turning back within just a few hundred yards of it due to harsh weather.

The first man to reach the summit was [[Walter Harper]], an [[Alaska Native]]. [[Robert Tatum]] also made the summit. Using the mountain's contemporary name, Tatum later commented, \"The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!\"{{sfn|Coombs|Washburn|1997|p=26}} They ascended the Muldrow Glacier route pioneered by the earlier expeditions, which is still often climbed today. Stuck confirmed, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and today it is widely believed that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about 200 feet (61 m) of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back.\n\nIn 1990, Russian high altitude mountaineer [[Anatoli Boukreev]] completed a solo speed ascent in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours from base camp to the summit via the west rib.<ref name=\"ABspeed\">{{cite web | url=http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web17s/newswire-katie-bono-denali-female-speed-record | title=Katie Bono sets probable women's speed record on Denali | publisher=Alpinist Magazine | date=June 23, 2017 | accessdate=March 13, 2019 | author=Franz, Derek}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain is regularly climbed today.

Camped on the flank of the mountain on August 3, Brooks noted later that while \"the ascent of Mount McKinley had never been part of our plans,\" the party decided to delay one day so \"that we might actually set foot on the slopes of the mountain.\" Setting off alone, with good weather, on August 4, Brooks aimed to reach a 10,000&nbsp;ft shoulder. At 7,500&nbsp;ft, Brooks found his way blocked by sheer ice and, after leaving a small cairn as a marker, descended.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/dena1/history.pdf|title=A History of Mount McKinley National Park|last=Pearson|first=Grant|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=9\u201312}}</ref> After the party's return, Brooks co-authored a \"Plan For Climbing Mt McKinley,\" published in ''[[National Geographic]]'' magazine in January, 1903, with fellow party-member and topographer D.L.

The group attempted to get as close to the mountain as possible via the [[Kantishna River|Kantishna river]] by [[Steamboat|steamer]], before offloading and following Chitsia Creek with a poling boat, mules and backpacks, a route suggested to them by [[Tanana Athabaskans|Tanana Athabaskan]] people they met along the way. The party received further navigational assistance at Anotoktilon, an Athabaskan hunting camp, where residents gave the group detailed directions to reach the glaciers at the foot of Denali. On reaching the mountain, the mountaineers set up base camp on the lower portion of [[Peters Glacier (Alaska Range)|Peters Glacier]]. Aiming for the northwest buttress of Denali's north peak, they attempted to ascend directly, however crevasses, ice fall and the lack of a clear passage caused them to turn and attempt to follow a spur via [[Jeffery Glacier]] where they believed they could see a way to the summit. After a dangerous ascent, at around 10,000&nbsp;ft, Wickersham found that the route did not connect as it had appeared from below, instead discovering \"a tremendous precipice beyond which we cannot go. Our only line of further ascent would be to climb the vertical wall of the mountain at our left, and that is impossible.\" This wall, now known as the [[Wickersham Wall]], juts 14,000&nbsp;ft upwards from the glacier to the north peak of Denali.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/dena/hrs3.htm|title=Denali NP: Historic Resource Study (Chapter 3)|website=www.nps.gov|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> Because of the route's history of avalanche danger, it was not successfully climbed until 1963.{{sfn|Beckey|1993|p=139}}\n\nLater in the summer of 1903, Dr. [[Frederick Cook]] led a team of five men on another attempt at the summit.

Cook approached the mountain via the Peters Glacier, as Wickersham had done, however he was able to overcome the ice fall that had caused the previous group to turn up the spur towards the Wickersham Wall. Despite avoiding this obstacle, on August 31, having reached an elevation of about 10,900 ft on the northwest buttress of the north peak, the party found they had reached a dead end and could make no further progress. On the descent, the group completely circumnavigated the mountain, the first climbing party to do so.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Mount McKinley: Icy Crown of North America|last=Beckey|first=Fred|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|year=1993|isbn=9780898866469|location=|pages=295}}</ref>  Although Cook's 1903 expedition did not reach the summit, he received acclaim for the accomplishment, a 1000 mile trek in which he not only circled the entire mountain but also found, on the descent, an accessible pass northeast of the [[Muldrow Glacier]] following the headwaters of the [[Toklat River|Toklat]] and [[Chulitna River (Susitna River)|Chulitna]] rivers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1906, Cook launched another expedition to Denali with co-leader [[Herschel Parker]], a [[Columbia University]] professor of electrical engineering with extensive mountaineering experience. Belmore Browne, an experienced climber and five other men comprised the rest of the group. Cook and Parker's group spent the bulk of the summer season exploring the southern and southeastern approaches to the mountain, eventually reaching a high point on [[Tokositna Glacier|Tokositna glacier]], 25 miles from the summit.<ref name=\":3\" /> During their explorations the party mapped out many of the tributaries and glaciers of the [[Susitna River|Susitna river]] along the mountain's south flank.<ref name=\":0\" />  As the summer ended, the team retreated to the coast and began to disperse. In September 1906, Cook and a single party-member, horseman Robert Barrill, struck out towards the summit again, in what Cook later described as \"a last desperate attempt\" in a telegram to his financial backers.<ref name=\":0\" /> Cook and Barrill spent 12 days in total on the attempt, and claimed to have reached the summit via the [[Ruth Glacier]].<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\nUpon hearing Cook's claims, Parker and Browne were immediately suspicious.

By 1909, Barrill had recanted at least part of his story about the climb, and others publicly questioned the account, however Cook continued to assert his claim<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.osu.edu/projects/frederick-cook/controversy.html|title=Controversy - Frederick A. Cook Digital Exhibition|website=library.osu.edu|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>  The controversy continued for decades. In 1956, mountaineers [[Bradford Washburn]] and Walter Gonnason tried to settle the matter, with Gonnason attempting to follow Cook's purported route to the summit. Washburn noted inconsistencies between Cook's account of locations of glaciers and found a spot, at 5,400 ft and 19 miles southeast of the summit that appeared identical to the supposed summit image. Gonnason was not able to complete the climb, but because he was turned back by poor weather, felt that this did not definitely disprove Cook's story.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4017660/mount-mckinley-denali-ascent-hoax/|title=The Other Mount McKinley Controversy: Who Climbed Denali First|last=Berman|first=Eliza|website=Time|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> In 1998, historian Robert Bryce discovered an original and un-cropped version of the \"fake peak\" photograph of Barrill standing on the promontory.

The group spent approximately three months on the mountain.  Their purported summit ascent day included carrying a bag of doughnuts each, a thermos of hot chocolate, and a 14-foot (4.2 m) spruce pole.  Two of them reached the North Summit, the lower of the two, and erected the pole near the top. According to the group, the time they took to reach the summit was a total of 18 hours.

The first man to reach the summit was [[Walter Harper]], an [[Alaska Native]]. [[Robert Tatum]] also made the summit. Using the mountain's contemporary name, Tatum later commented, \"The view from the top of Mount McKinley is like looking out the windows of Heaven!\"{{sfn|Coombs|Washburn|1997|p=26}} They ascended the Muldrow Glacier route pioneered by the earlier expeditions, which is still often climbed today. Stuck confirmed, via binoculars, the presence of a large pole near the North Summit; this report confirmed the Sourdough ascent, and today it is widely believed that the Sourdoughs did succeed on the North Summit. However, the pole was never seen before or since, so there is still some doubt. Stuck also discovered that the Parker-Browne party were only about 200 feet (61 m) of elevation short of the true summit when they turned back.\n\nIn 1990, Russian high altitude mountaineer [[Anatoli Boukreev]] completed a solo speed ascent in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours from base camp to the summit via the west rib.<ref name=\"ABspeed\">{{cite web | url=http://www.alpinist.com/doc/web17s/newswire-katie-bono-denali-female-speed-record | title=Katie Bono sets probable women's speed record on Denali | publisher=Alpinist Magazine | date=June 23, 2017 | accessdate=March 13, 2019 | author=Franz, Derek}}</ref>\n\nThe mountain is regularly climbed today.

Between the [[London 2012 Olympic bid|successful bid]] and the Olympics and Paralympics themselves, several details and venues changed.\n\n==Sporting venues==\nThe 2012 Games used a mixture of newly built venues, existing facilities and temporary facilities, some of them in well known locations such as [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Horse Guards Parade]]. In the wake of the problems that plagued the [[Millennium Dome]], the intention was that there would be no [[white elephant]]s after the games. Some of the facilities are being reused in their Olympic form, while others were constructed so that they could either be reduced in size or moved elsewhere in the UK. The plans were intended to contribute to the regeneration of [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] in east London which is the site of the Olympic Park and of the neighbouring [[Lower Lea Valley]].\n\nThe venues within [[Greater London]] were divided into three zones: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition to these were venues that, by necessity, are outside the boundaries of Greater London.\n\n===Naming===\nThe IOC has a number of major [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] sponsors for the Olympics, who are entitled to have their name exclusively associated with the event. As a consequence, any other company that provided sponsorship was not permitted to use its name or branding during the games, which includes as part of the name of any venue. Thus, three Olympic venues were temporarily renamed for the duration of the Games:\n*[[The O2 Arena]] \u2013 North Greenwich Arena\n*[[St James' Park|Sports Direct Arena]] \u2013 St James' Park\n*[[Ricoh Arena|The Ricoh Arena]] \u2013 City of Coventry Stadium\n\n===Olympic Park Zone===\nThe Olympic Zone encompassed all of the facilities within the {{convert|500|acre|sqkm|0}} [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]]. This park was developed on existing waste and industrial land, and is seven minutes by [[Olympic Javelin]] train from central London. The park contained in the following below:\n{{Wide image|Olympic Park, London, 16 April 2012 (2).jpg|800px|Aerial view of the Olympic Park in April 2012}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Venue\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Permanent/<br>Temporary\n!colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Sports\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Capacity\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n!

officials (some 17,320 beds in total). After the games the village will become a district of the [[Stratford City]] development, a multibillion-pound development project on the former railway goods yard to the east of the Olympic Park. (Accredited technical officials \u2014 referees, umpires, etc. \u2014 are housed in hotel space in [[London Docklands]]).\n* The Olympic Press and Broadcast Centres.\n* [[Park Live]]\n\nThe original plan called for the construction of five new indoor arenas, four in the Olympic Park, and one in the River Zone (see below). In order to save money this was reduced to two. The existing venues at Earls Court and Wembley Arena were added to the plans, and various sports were shuffled around to make this possible.\n\nThe construction of the Olympic Park itself commenced in 2006, with Murphy Group awarded the contract to remove the powerlines which crossed the site and move these into a tunnel to be dug beneath the site. [[Civil engineering]] companies Morrisons and Nuttalls were appointed to undertake the demolition and land remediation works, under the project management of [[Atkins (company)|WS Atkins]]. The pace of this speeded up with the closure of the roads crossing the Olympic Park in June 2007. The construction phase of the Olympic Park was managed by CLM, a consortium comprising [[CH2M Hill]], [[Laing O'Rourke]] and [[Mace (construction company)|Mace]]. This consortium is officially titled Delivery Partner, ODA. The earliest construction of venues commenced in April 2008 with the start of the main build on the Olympic Stadium by [[Sir Robert McAlpine|McAlpine]], with the nearby energy centre to be constructed by [[EDF Energy]]. Work on the Aquatics Centre began later the same year. During the construction phase the workforce on-site is expected to peak at 9,000 operatives.\n\nAccidents during construction of the venues resulted in no deaths - the only time this has happened in the history of Olympic construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehstoday.com/construction/exploring-record-breaking-health-and-safety-performance-2012-olympic-games|title=Exploring the Record-Breaking Health and Safety Performance of the 2012 Olympic Games|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===River Zone===\n[[File:Basket Ball at the O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|right|[[The O2 Arena (London)|The O2 Arena (North Greenwich Arena)]] is a venue for [[gymnastics]] and [[basketball]].]]\nThe River Zone features four main venues in the [[Thames Gateway]] area straddling the [[River Thames]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Venue\n!colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Sports\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Capacity\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n!

It was announced in August 2008 that the revised venue would be at [[Hadleigh Farm]], also in Essex.\n\nIn August 2009, [[Villa Park]] was withdrawn from the list of venues for the football competition, due to uncertainty over [[Aston Villa]]'s redevelopment plans for the stadium, and was replaced by the [[Ricoh Arena|City of Coventry Stadium]] in [[Coventry]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Villa Park pulled out of Olympics |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympic_games/8193075.stm|date=10 August 2009 |work= |publisher= BBC News|accessdate=10 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.today/20120906204358/www.london2012.com/games/venues/index.php Olympic Park venues] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20121230133038/http://www.london2012.com/ London 2012]\n* [https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&t=k&ll=51.545601,-0.008197&spn=0.008153,0.018475&om=1 View the Olympic Park] on [[Google Maps]]\n* [http://www.inclusivelondon.com/search/what/0/37523/921/0/London/Olympic%20And%20Paralympic%20Venues/0/0/0/0/0/search.aspx?tbclr=1 Olympic And Paralympic Venues in London \u2013 accessibility] at Inclusive London\n* [http://www.cashstore.com/olympics/ 2012 London Olympic Venue Ticket Prices] at CoolInfographics\n\n{{2012 Summer Olympics venues}}\n{{2012 Summer Paralympics venues}}\n{{Olympic venues}}\n{{Paralympic venues}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of 2012 Summer Olympics Venues}}\n[[Category:Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Summer Olympic venues|2012]]\n[[Category:2012 Summer Paralympic venues]]\n[[Category:Olympic Games venues in the United Kingdom|2012]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2012}}\n{{2012 Summer Olympics}}\n{{2012 Summer Paralympics Sidebar}}\nThe '''[[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]] venues''' were mostly located in the host city of [[London]], though some other events required facilities located elsewhere. Between the [[London 2012 Olympic bid|successful bid]] and the Olympics and Paralympics themselves, several details and venues changed.\n\n==Sporting venues==\nThe 2012 Games used a mixture of newly built venues, existing facilities and temporary facilities, some of them in well known locations such as [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Horse Guards Parade]]. In the wake of the problems that plagued the [[Millennium Dome]], the intention was that there would be no [[white elephant]]s after the games. Some of the facilities are being reused in their Olympic form, while others were constructed so that they could either be reduced in size or moved elsewhere in the UK. The plans were intended to contribute to the regeneration of [[Stratford, London|Stratford]] in east London which is the site of the Olympic Park and of the neighbouring [[Lower Lea Valley]].\n\nThe venues within [[Greater London]] were divided into three zones: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition to these were venues that, by necessity, are outside the boundaries of Greater London.\n\n===Naming===\nThe IOC has a number of major [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip]] sponsors for the Olympics, who are entitled to have their name exclusively associated with the event. As a consequence, any other company that provided sponsorship was not permitted to use its name or branding during the games, which includes as part of the name of any venue. Thus, three Olympic venues were temporarily renamed for the duration of the Games:\n*[[The O2 Arena]] \u2013 North Greenwich Arena\n*[[St James' Park|Sports Direct Arena]] \u2013 St James' Park\n*[[Ricoh Arena|The Ricoh Arena]] \u2013 City of Coventry Stadium\n\n===Olympic Park Zone===\nThe Olympic Zone encompassed all of the facilities within the {{convert|500|acre|sqkm|0}} [[Olympic Park, London|Olympic Park]] in [[Stratford, London|Stratford]]. This park was developed on existing waste and industrial land, and is seven minutes by [[Olympic Javelin]] train from central London. The park contained in the following below:\n{{Wide image|Olympic Park, London, 16 April 2012 (2).jpg|800px|Aerial view of the Olympic Park in April 2012}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Venue\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Permanent/<br>Temporary\n!colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Sports\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Capacity\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n!

officials (some 17,320 beds in total). After the games the village will become a district of the [[Stratford City]] development, a multibillion-pound development project on the former railway goods yard to the east of the Olympic Park. (Accredited technical officials \u2014 referees, umpires, etc. \u2014 are housed in hotel space in [[London Docklands]]).\n* The Olympic Press and Broadcast Centres.\n* [[Park Live]]\n\nThe original plan called for the construction of five new indoor arenas, four in the Olympic Park, and one in the River Zone (see below). In order to save money this was reduced to two. The existing venues at Earls Court and Wembley Arena were added to the plans, and various sports were shuffled around to make this possible.\n\nThe construction of the Olympic Park itself commenced in 2006, with Murphy Group awarded the contract to remove the powerlines which crossed the site and move these into a tunnel to be dug beneath the site. [[Civil engineering]] companies Morrisons and Nuttalls were appointed to undertake the demolition and land remediation works, under the project management of [[Atkins (company)|WS Atkins]]. The pace of this speeded up with the closure of the roads crossing the Olympic Park in June 2007. The construction phase of the Olympic Park was managed by CLM, a consortium comprising [[CH2M Hill]], [[Laing O'Rourke]] and [[Mace (construction company)|Mace]]. This consortium is officially titled Delivery Partner, ODA. The earliest construction of venues commenced in April 2008 with the start of the main build on the Olympic Stadium by [[Sir Robert McAlpine|McAlpine]], with the nearby energy centre to be constructed by [[EDF Energy]]. Work on the Aquatics Centre began later the same year. During the construction phase the workforce on-site is expected to peak at 9,000 operatives.\n\nAccidents during construction of the venues resulted in no deaths - the only time this has happened in the history of Olympic construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ehstoday.com/construction/exploring-record-breaking-health-and-safety-performance-2012-olympic-games|title=Exploring the Record-Breaking Health and Safety Performance of the 2012 Olympic Games|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===River Zone===\n[[File:Basket Ball at the O2 Arena.jpg|thumb|right|[[The O2 Arena (London)|The O2 Arena (North Greenwich Arena)]] is a venue for [[gymnastics]] and [[basketball]].]]\nThe River Zone features four main venues in the [[Thames Gateway]] area straddling the [[River Thames]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Venue\n!colspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"|Sports\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Capacity\n!rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\"| Ref.\n|-\n!

evaluation, has seen numerous improvements, including the expansion of the [[East London Line]], upgrades to the [[Docklands Light Railway]] and the [[North London Line]], and the new [[Olympic Javelin]] service. It is almost impossible to assess how many of the proposed improvements would have happened in any case. The games were won without a commitment to deliver [[Crossrail]] by 2012. This is the largest transport project proposed for London, and it was widely assumed in the early stages of the bidding process that the games could not be won without a guarantee that it would be completed before the games.\n\nDuring the games, 80% of athletes are within 20 minutes of their events and 97% are within 30 minutes of their events. Together, all the planned [[National Rail]], light rail, and underground services (excluding Crossrail) are expected to deliver around 240 trains every hour.<ref>AlwaysTouchout.com (2005).

The most significant change was the relocation of the [[volleyball]] events from a new Olympic Arena to the existing venue of [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]], which is several miles to the west. The revision also involved the re-organisation of the park shuffling the [[Basketball]], [[Cycling]], [[Fencing]], [[Tennis]] and [[Field hockey]] venues in addition to the Press and Broadcast Centre. This move was designed to remove the need for the relocation of 80 businesses and to provide a more coherent legacy for the sporting venues.\n\nAnother change was the relocation of the [[badminton]] and [[rhythmic gymnastics]] events to [[Wembley Arena]] in north-west London, instead of a proposed new venue near the [[The O2 Arena|North Greenwich Arena]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nTwo venues to be developed outside central London have been also relocated from the original bid sites.

The start of the following campaign was no different either as Barton was overlooked for the opening dozen fixtures of the season.

His dismay can perhaps be imagined when, despite the visitors scoring five goals, the home side won with what was virtually the last kick of the game.
