It was released as the album's second single on August 25, 1987 by [[Sire Records]]. Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the 1991 UK compilation EP ''[[The Immaculate Collection (EP)|The Holiday Collection]]''. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Stephen Bray]], the song was inspired by Madonna's relationship with then husband [[Sean Penn]], and his abusive and violent nature. Containing a dance-oriented, up-[[tempo]] [[groove (music)|groove]], the song begins with the [[chorus effect|chorus]] and is accompanied by a four-note descending [[bassline]] and [[staccato]] chords in the verse.\n\nSince its release, the song has received mixed to positive reviews by critics. It became a top-ten hit in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' US dance chart. Madonna performed the song on the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was transmitted via satellite to the [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours.\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]'', known at the time as ''Slammer''. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted [[Patrick Leonard]] and [[Stephen Bray]], with whom she had written and produced her third studio album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' in 1986.<ref name=\"fred1\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=203}}</ref> The song was written and produced by Madonna and Bray for the film's soundtrack. It was inspired by her then husband [[Sean Penn]] and their often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2000|p=211}}</ref> That translated as the inspiration behind the song. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life,\n<blockquote>\n\"I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [the  paparazzi] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse.\"<ref name=\"rsint\">{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Senegal|date=September 10, 1987|title=Madonna: She's That Girl|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|volume=1019|issue=32|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn the United States, \"Causing a Commotion\" was released in August 1987. In the United Kingdom, the song was released just before the commencement of Madonna's 1987 [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in October.

It was released as the album's second single on August 25, 1987 by [[Sire Records]]. Its Silver Screen Single Mix later appeared on the 1991 UK compilation EP ''[[The Holiday Collection (EP)|The Holiday Collection]]''. Written and produced by Madonna and [[Stephen Bray]], the song was inspired by Madonna's relationship with then husband [[Sean Penn]], and his abusive and violent nature. Containing a dance-oriented, up-[[tempo]] [[groove (music)|groove]], the song begins with the [[chorus effect|chorus]] and is accompanied by a four-note descending [[bassline]] and [[staccato]] chords in the verse.\n\nSince its release, the song has received mixed to positive reviews by critics. It became a top-ten hit in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom, and topped the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' US dance chart. Madonna performed the song on the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]]&nbsp;\u2013 which was transmitted via satellite to the [[1987 MTV Video Music Awards]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the [[Blond Ambition World Tour]] in 1990. The performances were included in the home video release of the tours.\n\n== Background and release ==\nIn 1986, Madonna was shooting for her third motion picture ''[[Who's That Girl (1987 film)|Who's That Girl]]'', known at the time as ''Slammer''. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she contacted [[Patrick Leonard]] and [[Stephen Bray]], with whom she had written and produced her third studio album ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' in 1986.<ref name=\"fred1\">{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=203}}</ref> The song was written and produced by Madonna and Bray for the film's soundtrack. It was inspired by her then husband [[Sean Penn]] and their often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn was on the verge of breaking up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Feldman|2000|p=211}}</ref> That translated as the inspiration behind the song. In a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life,\n<blockquote>\n\"I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [the  paparazzi] many times. I never would, you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse.\"<ref name=\"rsint\">{{cite journal|last=Lawson|first=Senegal|date=September 10, 1987|title=Madonna: She's That Girl|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|volume=1019|issue=32|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn the United States, \"Causing a Commotion\" was released in August 1987. In the United Kingdom, the song was released just before the commencement of Madonna's 1987 [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] in October. In 1991, the Silver Screen Single Mix of the song was included on Madonna's ''[[The Holiday Collection (EP)|The Holiday Collection]]'' [[Extended play|EP]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=90}}</ref>\n\n== Recording and composition ==\n{{listen\n | filename     = Madonna - causing a commotion.ogg\n | title        = 'Causing a Commotion'\n | description  = A 20 second sample of Madonna's \"Causing a Commotion\" featuring the chorus.\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\"Causing a Commotion\" was recorded and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by Bray along with [[Shep Pettibone]] who also did additional production on the track.

Andrzej Ciuk, one of the editors of the book ''Exploring Space'' noted that the proverbial status of the phrase \"opposites attract\" as a defining key ingredient of cultural concept of \"love\" and this was evident also in the song with the lyrics: \"You met your match when you met me, I know that you'll disagree its crazy, But ''opposites attract'' you'll see, And I won't let you get away so easy\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ciuk|Molek-Kozakowska|2010|p=61}}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n[[File:Madonna II A 19 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Madonna performing the song on the [[Who's That Girl World Tour]] (1987).]]\nThe song received generally mixed to positive reviews. Rikky Rooksby, author of ''The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna'', said that the song was \"Perfectly acceptable, though not in the same class as '[[Who's That Girl (Madonna song)|Who's That Girl]]'.\"<ref name=\"rikky\"/> Christian Wright from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' called the song celebratory.<ref name=\"spin\">{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Yh9p0GCKsEC&pg=PA79|last=Wright|first=Christian|title=Madonna: Like a Prayer Review|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=5|issue=2|issn=0886-3032|date=May 1, 1989|ref=harv}}</ref> [[Camille Paglia]], one of the authors of ''The Madonna Companion: Two Decades of Commentary'', said that Madonna's command of massive, resonant basslines impressed her. She wrote: \"I recall my stunned admiration as I sat in the theater in 1987 and first experienced the crashing, descending chords of Madonna's 'Causing a Commotion', which opened her dreadful movie ''Who's That Girl''. If you want to hear the essence of modernity, listen to those chords, infernal, apocalyptic, and grossly sensual.

They are [[parasite|semi-parasitic]] on [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other plants. The common name refers to the plant's use in treating eye [[infection]]s.\n\nMany species are found in [[alpine meadow|alpine]] or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are [[zygomorphic]], and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.\n\nAlternative names, mainly in [[herbalism]], are ''Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae'' and ''Herbe d'Euphraise''.\n\n==Use in herbalism and medicine==\nThe plant was known to classical [[herbalist]]s, but then was not referred to until mentioned again in 1305. [[Nicholas Culpeper]] assigned it to the [[Zodiac]] sign [[leo (astrology)|Leo]], claiming that it strengthened the brain. It was also used to treat bad [[memory]] and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref>{{aut|Howard, Michael}} (1987): ''Traditional Folk Remedies''. Century. p.136</ref>\n\nIn the Elizabethan era the plant was used in ales and [[Gervase Markham]]'s ''Countrie Farm'' (1616) recommended that one should \"Drinke everie morning a small draught of Eyebright wine.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FgW4KJUSXkIC&pg=PA292|page=292|title=A Modern Herbal: The Medicinal, Culinary, Cosmetic and Economic Properties, Cultivation and Folk-lore of Herbs, Grasses, Fungi, Shrubs, & Trees with All Their Modern Scientific Uses, Volume 1|author=Grieve, Maud|year=1971|isbn=9780486227986}}</ref>\n\nHerbalists use eyebright as a [[poultice]] with or without concurrent administration of a tea for the redness, swelling, and visual disturbances caused by [[blepharitis]] and [[conjunctivitis]]. The herb is also used for [[eyestrain]] and to relieve inflammation caused by [[colds]], [[cough]]s, [[sinus infection]]s, [[sore throat]]s and [[hay fever]].\n\nParts used include the leaf, the stem, and small pieces of the flowers. Typical preparations include a [[warm compress]] or tea.

They are [[parasite|semi-parasitic]] on [[Poaceae|grasses]] and other plants. The common name refers to the plant's use in treating eye [[infection]]s.\n\nMany species are found in [[alpine meadow|alpine]] or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are [[zygomorphic]], and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow markings on the lower petal to act as a guide to pollinating insects.\n\nAlternative names, mainly in [[herbalism]], are ''Augentrostkraut, Euphrasiae herba, Herba Euphrasiae'' and ''Herbe d'Euphraise''.\n\n==Use in herbalism and medicine==\nThe plant was known to classical [[herbalist]]s, but then was not referred to until mentioned again in 1305. [[Nicholas Culpeper]] assigned it to the [[Zodiac]] sign [[leo (astrology)|Leo]], claiming that it strengthened the brain. It was also used to treat bad [[memory]] and [[vertigo (medical)|vertigo]].<ref>{{aut|Howard, Michael}} (1987): ''Traditional Folk Remedies''.

The herb is also used for [[eyestrain]] and to relieve inflammation caused by [[colds]], [[cough]]s, [[sinus infection]]s, [[sore throat]]s and [[hay fever]].\n\nParts used include the leaf, the stem, and small pieces of the flowers.

Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by both of these organizations. There were several disagreements, with more than one champion being recognized on seven occasions.\n\nThe ''Daily Racing Form'', the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award.

It became part of the [[Eclipse Award]]s program in 1971.\n\nThe award originated in 1936 when both the ''[[Daily Racing Form]]'' (DRF) and Turf and Sports Digest (TSD) magazine began naming an annual champion. Starting in 1950, the Thoroughbred Racing Associations (TRA) began naming its own champion. The following list provides the name of the horses chosen by both of these organizations. There were several disagreements, with more than one champion being recognized on seven occasions.\n\nThe ''Daily Racing Form'', the Thoroughbred Racing Associations, and the National Turf Writers Association all joined forces in 1971 to create the Eclipse Award. In 1978, the voting resulted in a tie between two fillies.\n\nChampions from 1887 through 1935 were selected retrospectively by a panel of experts as published by ''[[The Blood-Horse magazine]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/eclipsewinners/pdf/History_Charts.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904120526/http://www.bloodhorse.com/eclipsewinners/pdf/History_Charts.pdf |archive-date=September 4, 2012 |url-status=bot: unknown |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Honorees==\n\n===Eclipse Awards===\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|-  style=\"background:#b94e48; text-align:center;\"\n! style=\"width:42px;\"| '''Year'''<br>\n! style=\"width:155px;\"| '''Horse'''<br>\n! style=\"width:165px;\"| '''Trainer'''<br>\n! style= |'''Owner'''\n|-\n|align=center|2018\n|[[Jaywalk (horse)|Jaywalk]]\n|[[John Servis]] \n|D.

The DOE Office of Biological and Environmental Research funds and oversees its research and operations.\n\n==Research==\n\nEMSL scientists and collaborators perform fundamental research that focuses on the biological, biogeochemical, and physical principles to predict processes occurring at the molecular and genomics-controlled smallest scales to the environmental Earth system changes at the largest scales.[[File:Web Size-BrownRot-28.jpg|frame|A biologist is preparing an RNA sample to understand how brown rot fungi degrades wood.]]\n\nEMSL uses six Integrated Research Platforms to uncover critical information for understanding and predicting the molecular functions of biological and ecosystem processes.\n\n* '''Functional Omics''' integrates transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to uncover biological processes in plant, fungal, and microbial systems.\n* '''Isotope and Chemical Analysis''' tracks the fate of isotopes and analyzes the chemistry of biological and environmental systems.\n* '''Molecular Bioimaging''' provides images of the structure and location of proteins and other biomolecules at nanoscale spatial and temporal resolutions.\n* Biogeochemical Transformation investigates how molecular interactions at the Earth\u2019s land, water, and air interfaces transform and transport nutrients and contaminants within the environment.\n* '''Cellular Dynamics''' uncovers the molecular signals within and between cells as they respond to their environment and other organisms.\n* '''Molecular Plant Phenotyping''' probes the interaction between genes and the environment to understand, predict, and control plant traits.\n\n==Operations==\n\nEMSL is a user research facility whereby scientists, from around the world, can submit project proposals to access the laboratory\u2019s experts and equipment at no cost. Proposals are screened through a competitive peer-review process to ensure the project is scientifically impactful and relevant to DOE's Office of Biological and Environmental Research mission.\n\nScientists whose proposals are accepted are referred to as \u201cEMSL users.\u201d Typical user research projects can last a few months to a few years. EMSL users do not have to stay on-site for the duration of their project and can visit the laboratory when needed. Much of the sample processing and analysis can be handled remotely.\n\nEMSL's user community provides the laboratory\u2019s management team with recommendations for scientific direction and efficient operations through an elected committee of representatives.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The beginnings (1986\u20131997) ===\n\nThe idea that would become EMSL began in 1985 with a National Academy of Sciences report titled ''Opportunities in Chemistry''. The report identified scientific challenges relating to energy and the environment that required fundamental research to achieve a solution. In response, then director of PNNL, William R. Wiley, and lab senior managers proposed a center for molecular science that would bring together theoreticians with experience in computing, modeling of molecular processes, and researchers from the physical and life sciences. Their recommendations would become EMSL, a center with advanced instrumentation for the study of molecular-level chemistry.\n\nWiley envisioned a facility where the research was conducted in an integrated and collaborative manner. \u201cProblems don\u2019t come in small, unique, compartmentalized packages. We must recognize the interrelationships,\u201d said Wiley.\n\nOhio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, which operates PNNL for DOE, approved $8.5 million in funding over four years to build the facility; develop research programs; and obtain the equipment, facilities, scientists, and staff to support these programs.\n\nPNNL began construction of the facility in July 1994 and completed the laboratory in August 1997. EMSL opened October 1, 1997, for full operation as DOE's newest national scientific user facility.\n\n=== The early years (1997\u20132001) ===\n\nDuring its first five years, EMSL operations focused on building capabilities, recruiting scientific leadership, and attracting users. The scientific focus then expanded to include biology, particularly the study of naturally occurring microbes for environmental cleanup, alternative energy, and carbon dioxide reduction in the atmosphere \u2013 critical challenges important to DOE.\n\nEMSL's early user program focused on single investigator studies \u2013 particularly those Wiley championed that crossed disciplinary boundaries \u2013 and quickly reached more than 1,000 users per year, representing every state and several foreign countries.\n\n=== A maturing program (2001\u20132009) ===\n\nDuring this period, EMSL focused on two grand challenges:\n\n* a biogeochemistry question concerning the fundamental interaction between microbes and minerals, and\n* a study addressing the structure and function of proteins in the cell membrane.\n\nWork on these challenges led to new opportunities for the scientific community \u2013 with research campaigns designed to focus teams on a single challenge. \n\nIn January 2007, EMSL celebrated its first permanent expansion: a nearly 4,000-square-foot raised floor within its high-performance computing operations center for an 11.8-teraflop supercomputer named Chinook, which was then the fifth-fastest system in the world. In April 2008, EMSL dedicated a new office pod to distinguished user J. Mike White that houses nearly 100 staff and users. In early 2012, EMSL opened its Quiet Wing housing a suite of ultra- sensitive high-resolution microscopy and scanning instruments.\n\n=== Building for the future (2009 to present) ===\n\nIn October 2010, EMSL\u2019s premier computational chemistry software package,  NWChem, went open source \u2013 allowing computer scientists worldwide to contribute to its future development and making it available to more researchers and students. The code has been cited over 3760 times (according to a Web of Science search in 2020) since 2010.\n\nIn June 2013, EMSL retired the Chinook supercomputer and welcomed Cascade, a 3.4-petaflops system.\n\nEMSL celebrated its twentieth anniversary in August 2017, showcasing NWChem computational chemistry software, and advances in subsurface science and foundational biofuel production. Scientific leaders participated in the event, including internationally recognized scientists Thom Dunning, Steve Colson, and Jean Futrell.\n\nToday EMSL focuses its scientific discovery research in Functional and Systems Biology and Environmental Transformations and Interactions, together with users from diverse scientific communities.
