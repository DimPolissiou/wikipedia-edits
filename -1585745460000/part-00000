reveal the labor that makes California cool possible|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> Due to a combination of financial struggles and the passing of his grandmother, Gomez dropped out of CalArts after one year.<ref name=\":3\" /> In order to make a living, Gomez secured a private nanny job with a Los Angeles family, which he began in September 2009.<ref name=\":4\" /> He held this job for two years and it provided him with the stability he had lacked previously.<ref name=\":4\" /> Not only did it provide a steady income and a reliable living situation, but it also allowed Gomez to work alongside people whose backgrounds resembled his, reminding him of his family's Latino immigrant roots.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDuring these two years when Gomez cared for the family's children, he began his first artistic series, ''Domestic Scenes'', which documented his daily experiences and observations of the other workers in the home and the neighborhood.<ref name=\":4\" /> As the children napped, Gomez would retreat to his room so that he could paint loose representations of his fellow workers, depicting male workers in their outdoor sphere tending to the lawn and pool and female housekeepers cleaning the interiors.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Artistic career ==\n\n=== Early works ===\nWhile working as a nanny, Gomez would look at issues of ''Luxe'', ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]], ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', and [[Elle Decor|''Elle D\u00e9cor'']] displayed in his employer's home.<ref name=\":4\" /> Upon flipping through the pages, Gomez found the images devoid of the workers who maintained the advertised domestic lifestyle.<ref name=\":4\" /> This realization prompted him to begin his series, ''Domestic Scenes'' (2012\u2013present), in which he superimposes domestic workers onto advertisements in high-end magazines to reinsert an image of the Latino community into the public consciousness.<ref name=\":1\" /> Gomez depicts the figures of housekeepers, nannies, and gardeners completing their daily duties in the [[Chicano]] [[rasquache]] style, as a way to both, acknowledge and document their lives and labor.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGomez gives each of his workers a Latino name such as Maria, Lupita, or Carmen but renders the figures with loose and rough strokes that blur any identifiable facial features, which writer Katharine Schwab states \"reframes the [[David Hockney]] paintings and glossy magazine advertisements he takes for inspiration, putting the lives of California\u2019s near-invisible and individually disposable workers front and center.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition to their names, most of his figures are presented with dark skin and brown hair to fully represent the archetype of a Latino domestic worker.<ref name=\":5\" /> The series acts as a photo study, documenting the figures that advertisements have erased from the narrative.<ref name=\":4\" /> These images earned Gomez recognition within the art world, resulting in his partnership with the California-based art dealer Charlie James Gallery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== David Hockney ===\nGomez has stated that he sees David Hockney as a personal hero and an influence for many of his works, as well as helping him to openly embrace his sexuality.<ref name=\":3\" /> Hockney is known for creating idealistic depictions of Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\":5\" /> His modernist style rendered the splendor of Los Angeles residents, homes and pop culture.<ref name=\":5\" /> Gomez sought to revise Hockney's compositions by including the implied characters who work to maintain the depicted beauty as well as to portray dark-skinned workers, diverting the focus of the piece from luxury to labor.<ref name=\":5\" /> Gomez reimagined Hockney's ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'' (1967), with his version, ''No Splash,'' which he completed in 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /> While Gomez's reproduction does not depict Hockney's large splash in the foreground, it does include two faceless workers in the background who clean windows and rake the pool.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gomez's painting is currently in the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego]]'s (MCA San Diego) permanent collection.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Cardboard cutouts ===\nGomez crosses mediums to cardboard to represent Latino gardeners, custodians, and workers in his series entitled ''Cut-Outs''. In this series, Gomez\u2019s main objective was \"to slow people down, to have them double-take, to make them take notice and see\" the cardboard figures that he placed along the sidewalks, on lawns, and against buildings.<ref name=\":2\" /> Gomez paints his loose renderings of people on life-size cardboard cutouts, which he collects from the dumpsters behind a [[Best Buy]] at the corner of [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] and [[La Brea Avenue]].<ref name=\":5\" /> While the destinations and arrangements for each figure are carefully thought out and executed, Gomez knows that the cutouts\u2019 lives are short-lived as they are either stolen, thrown out or destroyed.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Gomez, the disposability of the cardboard figures acts as commentary on the perceived replaceability of domestic and maintenance workers. Gomez's husband, photographer David Feldman, photographs images of the cutouts for exhibitions nationwide.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2013, the [[UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center]] at UCLA offered Gomez his first solo exhibition, entitled ''Luxury Interrupted'', to present images of his cutouts.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGomez displays most of his cutouts throughout the lawns, street corners, and playgrounds of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], which he says is intended to force passersby to recognize who maintains the city and cares for its children.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2012, Gomez planted four cardboard Latino workers on the hedge of actor [[George Clooney]]\u2019s home prior to a fundraiser event that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] was to attend.<ref name=\":4\" /> One of the figures displayed a sign that read \"We are all American\". His intent was to demonstrate the political dimensions of his art by both representing and humanizing his subjects.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Katharine Schwab, Gomez uses the power and accessibility of street art to force society to recognize who maintains city and cares for its children.

reveal the labor that makes California cool possible|last=Miranda|first=Carolina A.|website=latimes.com|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> Due to a combination of financial struggles and the passing of his grandmother, Gomez dropped out of CalArts after one year.<ref name=\":3\" /> In order to make a living, Gomez secured a private nanny job with a Los Angeles family, which he began in September 2009.<ref name=\":4\" /> He held this job for two years and it provided him with the stability he had lacked previously.<ref name=\":4\" /> Not only did it provide a steady income and a reliable living situation, but it also allowed Gomez to work alongside people whose backgrounds resembled his, reminding him of his family's Latino immigrant roots.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nDuring these two years when Gomez cared for the family's children, he began his first artistic series, ''Domestic Scenes'', which documented his daily experiences and observations of the other workers in the home and the neighborhood.<ref name=\":4\" /> As the children napped, Gomez would retreat to his room so that he could paint loose representations of his fellow workers, depicting male workers in their outdoor sphere tending to the lawn and pool and female housekeepers cleaning the interiors.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Artistic career ==\n\n=== Early works ===\nWhile working as a nanny, Gomez would look at issues of ''Luxe'', ''[[Dwell (magazine)|Dwell]], ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', and [[Elle Decor|''Elle D\u00e9cor'']] displayed in his employer's home.<ref name=\":4\" /> Upon flipping through the pages, Gomez found the images devoid of the workers who maintained the advertised domestic lifestyle.<ref name=\":4\" /> This realization prompted him to begin his series, ''Domestic Scenes'' (2012\u2013present), in which he superimposes domestic workers onto advertisements in high-end magazines to reinsert an image of the Latino community into the public consciousness.<ref name=\":1\" /> Gomez depicts the figures of housekeepers, nannies, and gardeners completing their daily duties in the [[Chicano]] [[rasquache]] style, as a way to both, acknowledge and document their lives and labor.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGomez gives each of his workers a Latino name such as Maria, Lupita, or Carmen but renders the figures with loose and rough strokes that blur any identifiable facial features, which writer Katharine Schwab states \"reframes the [[David Hockney]] paintings and glossy magazine advertisements he takes for inspiration, putting the lives of California\u2019s near-invisible and individually disposable workers front and center.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In addition to their names, most of his figures are presented with dark skin and brown hair to fully represent the archetype of a Latino domestic worker.<ref name=\":5\" /> The series acts as a photo study, documenting the figures that advertisements have erased from the narrative.<ref name=\":4\" /> These images earned Gomez recognition within the art world, resulting in his partnership with the California-based art dealer Charlie James Gallery.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== David Hockney ===\nGomez has stated that he sees David Hockney as a personal hero and an influence for many of his works, as well as helping him to openly embrace his sexuality.<ref name=\":3\" /> Hockney is known for creating idealistic depictions of Los Angeles, California.<ref name=\":5\" /> His modernist style rendered the splendor of Los Angeles residents, homes and pop culture.<ref name=\":5\" /> Gomez sought to revise Hockney's compositions by including the implied characters who work to maintain the depicted beauty as well as to portray dark-skinned workers, diverting the focus of the piece from luxury to labor.<ref name=\":5\" /> Gomez reimagined Hockney's ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'' (1967), with his version, ''No Splash,'' which he completed in 2014.<ref name=\":5\" /> While Gomez's reproduction does not depict Hockney's large splash in the foreground, it does include two faceless workers in the background who clean windows and rake the pool.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gomez's painting is currently in the [[Metropolitan Correctional Center, San Diego]]'s (MCA San Diego) permanent collection.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Cardboard cutouts ===\nGomez crosses mediums to cardboard to represent Latino gardeners, custodians, and workers in his series entitled ''Cut-Outs''. In this series, Gomez\u2019s main objective was \"to slow people down, to have them double-take, to make them take notice and see\" the cardboard figures that he placed along the sidewalks, on lawns, and against buildings.<ref name=\":2\" /> Gomez paints his loose renderings of people on life-size cardboard cutouts, which he collects from the dumpsters behind a [[Best Buy]] at the corner of [[Santa Monica Boulevard]] and [[La Brea Avenue]].<ref name=\":5\" /> While the destinations and arrangements for each figure are carefully thought out and executed, Gomez knows that the cutouts\u2019 lives are short-lived as they are either stolen, thrown out or destroyed.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Gomez, the disposability of the cardboard figures acts as commentary on the perceived replaceability of domestic and maintenance workers. Gomez's husband, photographer David Feldman, photographs images of the cutouts for exhibitions nationwide.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2013, the [[UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center]] at UCLA offered Gomez his first solo exhibition, entitled ''Luxury Interrupted'', to present images of his cutouts.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nGomez displays most of his cutouts throughout the lawns, street corners, and playgrounds of [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]] and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], which he says is intended to force passersby to recognize who maintains the city and cares for its children.<ref name=\":5\" /> In 2012, Gomez planted four cardboard Latino workers on the hedge of actor [[George Clooney]]\u2019s home prior to a fundraiser event that [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] was to attend.<ref name=\":4\" /> One of the figures displayed a sign that read \"We are all American\". His intent was to demonstrate the political dimensions of his art by both representing and humanizing his subjects.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Katharine Schwab, Gomez uses the power and accessibility of street art to force society to recognize who maintains city and cares for its children. Gomez explains that \"it was strange; actual humans involved in their labor had become invisible to most people, but the image of a human, there, in the middle of your day, and not at some museum or gallery, but there in the middle of your path, somehow that registered.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2017, [[Lacma|LACMA]] announced the inclusion of Gomez's works from his series, ''Cut-Outs'' (2015), in their permanent collection.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Recent Works ==\nIn 2017, artist [[Rafa Esparza]] invited Gomez to the [[Whitney Biennial]] in New York to participate in his exhibition, ''Figure Ground: Beyond the White Field.''

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 1 April, there have been 91 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nOther impacts and reactions include the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]], restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), [[panic buying]] of essential items and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services). Several schemes and policies have been implemented to provide financial support to businesses and individuals in order to limit the impact of the pandemic on the local economy.

The first case in the [[Bailiwick of Guernsey|Bailiwick]] was confirmed on 9 March when a person tested positive in [[Guernsey]] after returning from [[Tenerife]], and transmission within the Bailiwick was confirmed on 24 March. As of 1 April, there have been 91 cases identified in the Bailiwick\u2014all on the island of Guernsey\u2014and 1 person has died from the infection; no cases have been reported in [[Sark]], [[Herm]] or [[Alderney]].\n\nThe response by the [[States of Guernsey]] has been led by the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA)\u2014a senior cross-committee body responsible for coordinating actions in circumstances which present a serious risk to the health and welfare of the island\u2014chaired by [[Gavin St Pier]] and advised by the senior [[Policy and Resources Committee of Guernsey|Policy and Resources Committee]] (P&R) and the Committee for Health and Social Care (HSC). Following the first confirmed case in the Bailiwick, the CCA enacted the Emergency Powers (Coronavirus) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations 2020 on 17 March, a statutory instrument which enables the Medical Officer of Health to implement emergency measures enforceable by law; the first of which mandated that anyone arriving in the Bailiwick [[Isolation (health care)#Self-isolation|self-isolate]] for 14 days. Early measures focused on [[behaviour change (public health)|behaviour changing]] publicity; encouraging [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#Hand washing|hand-washing]], [[Hygiene#Respiratory hygiene|respiratory hygiene]] and [[social distancing]] measures, and advising against non-essential travel. Following the first confirmed case from on-island transmission, the CCA announced an immediate 'lockdown' starting from midnight on 25 March, comprising wide-ranging restrictions on freedom of movement, enforceable in law, whereby people have been ordered to stay at home and 'non-essential' businesses have been ordered to close.\n\nOther impacts and reactions include the [[List of events affected by the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|cancellation and postponement of sporting and cultural events]], the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on education|closure of schools and colleges]], restrictions on travel (both within and to and from the Bailiwick), [[panic buying]] of essential items and the shutdown of pubs, bars and restaurants (including those offering delivery services).

Data Syntax 2 ==\nData Syntax 2 is defined in Annex C of T.101:1994.

The graphical character coding of Data Syntax 2 is based on [[ITU T.51|T.51]].\n\nThe default G2 set of Data Syntax 2 is based on an older version of T.51, lacking the [[non-breaking space]], [[soft hyphen]], not sign ([[\u00ac]]) and broken bar ([[\u00a6]]) present in the current version, but adding a [[Greek diacritics|dialytika tonos]] (\u0385) at the beginning of the row of diacritical marks

Data Syntax 3 ==\nData Syntax 2 is defined in Annex D of T.101:1994. The graphical character coding of Data Syntax 3 is based on [[ITU T.51|T.51]].\n\nThe supplementary set for Data Syntax 3 is based on an older version of T.51, lacking the [[non-breaking space]], [[soft hyphen]], not sign ([[\u00ac]]) and broken bar ([[\u00a6]]) present in the current version, and allocating non-spacing marks for the [[overline]] and [[slash (punctuation)|solidus]] and several [[semigraphics|semigraphic characters]] to unallocated space in that set.\n\nSee [[T.51/ISO/IEC 6937#Two byte characters|the comments in the T.51 article]] for caveats about the combining mark Unicode mappings shown below. Unlike Unicode [[combining characters]], T.51 diacritic codes precede the base character.\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|Supplementary Set for Videotex Data Syntax 3<ref

At [[DuPont Manual High School]] Gaskins once painted a [[mural]] of [[Quadratic function|parabolic functions]] in her math class and created computer art illustrating the connection of contemporary door-knocker earrings to traditional [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] accessories. She was engaged, at even that early an age, with the intersection of art and science. That work led the way to her acceptance to [[Pratt Institute]] in Brooklyn where she earned her BFA in 1992.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1994 she received her MFA in Art and Technology from School of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. After working for some years in [[K\u201312]] and post-secondary education, community media and technology, Gaskins received a doctorate in Digital Media from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] in 2014.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://fabfoundation.org/index.php/about-fab-foundation/index.html|title=Fab Foundation \u2013 About Fab Foundation|website=fabfoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Her [[thesis]] started with making the connections of [[graffiti]] and [[Mathematics|math]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2014 she became director of the [[STEAM fields|STEAM]] Lab at [[Boston Arts Academy|Boston Art Academy]] which serves forty percent Black and forty percent [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] [[Secondary school|high-school]] students.<ref name=\":0\" /> As of 2018, Gaskins was a program manager at the Fab Foundation,<ref name=\":3\" /> a Boston-based nonprofit.

It was a digital projection on the Luna Chapel at the [[Eanger Irving Couse House and Studio\u2014Joseph Henry Sharp Studios|Couse-Sharp Historic Site]].
