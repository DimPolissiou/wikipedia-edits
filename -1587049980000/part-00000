The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

The regular season began on August 30 and concluded on November 5. It was the program's 44th season fielding a men's varsity soccer team, and their 7th season in the AAC. The 2019 season was [[Scott Calabrese]]'s third year as head coach for the program.\n\nUCF finished the season with a 15\u20133\u20132 overall record and a 6\u20130\u20131 conference record, best in the AAC. The Knights advanced to the finals of the [[American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament|AAC Tournament]] where they fell to [[2019 SMU Mustangs men's soccer team|SMU]] for the third consecutive year. They received an at-large bid to the the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and advanced to the third round where they were defeated by SMU. \n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2018 UCF Knights men's soccer team}}\nThe Knights are coming off a 13\u20133\u20133 season where they finished 5\u20131\u20131 in AAC play, earning them their first [[American Athletic Conference]] regular season title. In the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Men's Soccer Tournament]], UCF lost to [[SMU Mustangs men's soccer|SMU]] in [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty kicks]], 4\u20135 after a 1\u20131 draw in regulation and extra time. UCF earned an at-large berth into the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament]], where they were one of the 16 seeded teams (out of 48 teams total) given the 14 seed. It was UCF's first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2011. With the seed, they earned a bye into the second round where they hosted the winner of Washington and Lipscomb. Lipscomb beat Washington in penalties, and also ended up beating the Knights in overtime, thus ending the season for UCF.\n\nJunior striker, Cal Jennings, lead UCF in goals and assists for 2018 and was named a [[2018 NCAA Men's Soccer All-Americans|consensus All-American]] with [[TopDrawerSoccer.com|Top Drawer Soccer]], ''[[Soccer America]]'', [[United Soccer Coaches]], and CollegeSoccerNews.com all naming him as a first-team All-American.\n\n== Player movement ==\n=== Departures ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; \"\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Name\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Nat.\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Number\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Position\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Height\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Weight\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Year\n! style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Hometown\n! class=\"unsortable\" style=\"{{CollegeSecondaryStyle|UCF Knights|color=#000000}}\"| Reason for departure\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Andreas|Steineger|nolink=1}} || {{flag|NOR}} || 2 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=4}} || 190 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Oslo|Oslo, NOR]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Zachary|Waitman|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 5 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 165 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Montverde, Florida|Montverde, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Jonathan|Dean|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 6 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=8}} || 155 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Macon, Georgia|Macon, GA]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Gorka|Aperribay|nolink=1}} || {{flag|USA}} || 9 || {{sort|4|[[Forward (association football)|FW]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=1}} || 185 || {{sort|4|Senior}} || [[Winter Springs, Florida|Winter Springs, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Walker|Dawkins|nolink=1}}|| {{flag|USA}}  || 11 || {{sort|3|[[Midfielder|MF]]}} || {{height|ft=5|in=7}} || 135 || {{sort|4|RS-Senior}} || [[Royal Palm Beach, Florida|Royal Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Graduated\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9|Dulysse|nolink=1}} || {{flag|HAI}} || 16 || {{sort|2|[[Defender (association football)|DF]]}} || {{height|ft=6|in=0}} || 173 || {{sort|2|Sophomore}} || [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach, FL]] ||align=\"left\"| Transferred to [[Manhattan Jaspers soccer|Manhattan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gojaspers.com/news/2019/7/31/mens-soccer-manhattan-adds-two-for-2019.aspx|title=Manhattan Adds Two For 2019|website=Manhattan College Athletics|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=\"left\"| {{sortname|C.

She was laid down on 28 August 1941 at [[Bath, Maine]], by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Corp.; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. H. A. Baldridge; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 August 1942 at the [[Charlestown Navy Yard]] near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, Mass.]], Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Katz in command.\n\n''Taylor'' was the first [[destroyer]] to anchor in Japanese coastal waters at the end of [[World War II]] \u2013 one that, wrote Admiral [[William F. Halsey]], \"admirably performed every mission assigned to her.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = USS TAYLOR (DD DDE 468)|url = http://usstaylor468.org/|website = USS TAYLOR (DD DDE 468)|access-date = 2016-01-24}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== World War II ==\n\n''Taylor'' began her naval career with the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. Assigned to [[Destroyer Squadron 20]] (DESRON TWO ZERO), the destroyer trained at [[Casco Bay]], [[Maine]], and made her shakedown cruise in the northern Atlantic before beginning duty as a coastwise [[convoy]] escort. The latter duty lasted until mid-November when she escorted a transatlantic convoy to a point just off [[Casablanca]]. The transit was uneventful, save for the interception of a Spanish merchantman, SS ''Darro''. A boarding party from ''Taylor'' sent the neutral ship off to [[Gibraltar]] to prevent her from transmitting information about the convoy to the enemy. ''Taylor'' returned to the United States at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] early in December and remained there until mid-month.\n\n===  Rennell Island, Jan. 1943 ===\n\nOn 17 December, the warship cleared [[Hampton Roads]] in company with [[Task Force 13]] (TF&nbsp;13) on her way to duty with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. After transiting the [[Panama Canal]] and stopping at [[Tutuila]] in the [[Samoan Islands]], the destroyer reported at [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]], on 20 January 1943 for duty in the [[South West Pacific Area]]. From Noum\u00e9a, ''Taylor'' continued west to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]] group, entering Havannah Harbor on the 26th. There, she became a unit of [[Destroyer Squadron 21]]'s Destroyer Division 41 (DesDiv&nbsp;41), one of two four-destroyer divisions screening Rear Admiral [[Robert C. Giffen]]'s [[Task Force 18]], comprising three [[heavy cruiser]]s, three [[light cruiser]]s, and two [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s.\n\nOn 27 January, ''Taylor'' cleared [[Havannah Harbor]] with the other ships of TF&nbsp;18, one of several task forces sent out to screen an important reinforcement echelon to [[Guadalcanal]]. Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey]], operating upon intelligence which indicated a major Japanese attempt to reinforce their beleaguered garrison on the island, sent out the large screening force in the hope and expectation of a major naval engagement. That sea battle never materialized because the enemy activities upon which he predicated his actions were actually movements preparatory to a Japanese withdrawal. Instead, at the [[battle of Rennell Island]], the enemy subjected TF&nbsp;18 to a scathing air attack. On the evening of 29 January, enemy [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers attacked TF&nbsp;18 with [[torpedo]]es. The ships brushed off the first attack with antiaircraft fire, suffered negligible damage, and raced on to rendezvous with the other elements of the covering force. After a concerted effort, the Japanese fliers finally scored a crippling torpedo hit on {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|2}} (CA-29). When {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}} (CA-28) took the stricken cruiser in tow, ''Taylor'' helped to screen the retiring ships as they steamed out of range of enemy aircraft. The following day, more enemy planes appeared and attacked. After ''Chicago'' took four more torpedo hits, her crew and the warships covering her abandoned the heavy cruiser to her watery fate and returned to Efate.\n\n=== Feb. &ndash; April 1943 ===\n\nOn 4 February, ''Taylor'' and the other ships of DesRon 21 were transferred to TF&nbsp;67, Rear Admiral [[Walden L. Ainsworth]]'s cruiser-destroyer force. Soon thereafter, TF&nbsp;67 became TF&nbsp;18, and the former TF&nbsp;18 became TF&nbsp;19. In any event, during February and March, ''Taylor'' screened Ainsworth's\ncruisers\u2014[[USS St. Louis (CL-49)|''St. Louis'']] (CL-49),\n[[USS Honolulu (CL-48)|''Honolulu'']] (CL-48), and\n[[USS Helena (CL-50)|''Helena'']] (CL-50)\u2014during\noperations between [[Espiritu Santo]] and Guadalcanal. During the night of 15&ndash;16 March, she joined\n[[USS Nicholas (DD-449)|''Nicholas'']] (DD-449),\n[[USS Radford (DD-446)|''Radford'']] (DD-446), and\n[[USS Strong (DD-467)|''Strong'']] (DD-467)\nin the fourth bombardment of the [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila-Stanmore Plantation]] located on [[Kolombangara]] Island in the central [[Solomon Islands]]. On 26 March, the destroyer cleared Espiritu Santo to escort\n[[USS Kanawha (AO-1)|''Kanawha'']] (AO-1),\n[[USS Aloe (YN-1)|''Aloe'']] (YN-1),\nand six coastal transports to Guadalcanal. The ships reached [[Tulagi]] on the 29th; and, while ''Kanawha'' discharged cargo, ''Taylor'' resumed operations at sea with Ainsworth's cruisers.\n\nOn the nights of 4, 5, and 6 April, she joined them in sweeps up \"[[the Slot]]\" before being ordered back to Tulagi on the 7th to pick up ''Kanawha''. When the destroyer was just about to enter Tulagi, a strong Japanese air raid cancelled her mission by severely bombing ''Kanawha'' before the old oiler could clear the harbor completely. With ''Kanawha'' disabled, ''Taylor'' rang up 30&nbsp;knots and cleared the area via [[Sealark Channel]]. During her transit of the channel, the warship claimed the destruction of three enemy planes and hits on two others.\n\nFor much of the month, ''Taylor'' escorted convoys in the Solomons and between those islands and Espiritu Santo. On 20 April, she rejoined TF&nbsp;18. After a brief tender overhaul, the destroyer accompanied the cruisers up the \"Slot\" twice during the 10 days between 4 and 14 May to cover [[Naval mine|mining]] operations in [[Vella Gulf]]. During the second operation, conducted between the 11th and the 14th, she and the other warships bombarded enemy installations at [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]], [[Bairoko Harbor]], and [[Enogai Inlet]].\n\n=== May &ndash; July 1943 ===\n\nBetween late May and early July, ''Taylor'' performed escort duty. On 25 May, she cleared Espiritu Santo with [[USS Munargo (AP-20)|''Munargo'']] (AP-20), escorted the transport to the [[180th meridian]], and returned to Espiritu Santo on the 30th. During her next assignment\u2014escorting a convoy of troop transports to Guadalcanal and back\u2014she defended her charges against Japanese planes which jumped the task unit on 10 June south of [[Makira|San Cristobal]]. After repairs at Espiritu Santo, she served with the [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] screen of escort carrier [[USS Sangamon (ACV-26)|''Sangamon'']] (ACV-26) until 6 July when she headed for Tulagi to report for duty with TF&nbsp;31.\n\nFor the next four months, ''Taylor'' supported the invasions of the central Solomons. In July, she supported the [[New Georgia]] landings. On the 11th and 12th, the destroyer covered the landing of troops and supplies at [[Rice Anchorage]] on [[Kula Gulf]] as well as the evacuation of wounded. On the morning of the 12th, she attacked and damaged a Japanese [[Ro-type submarine]], but could claim no definite sinking. That afternoon, ''Taylor'' was temporarily detached from TF&nbsp;31 and assigned to TF&nbsp;18. She headed up the \"Slot\" with Ainsworth's cruisers\u2014the same ones with which she had previously served except that {{HMNZS|Leander}} replaced ''Helena'' after the latter cruiser was lost in the [[Battle of Kula Gulf]]\u2014to intercept a Japanese surface force. That evening, the two forces collided. ''Taylor'' and the other van destroyers launched torpedoes and then joined the remainder of TF&nbsp;18 in engaging the enemy with their guns. It may well have been one of ''Taylor''{{'}}s \"fish\" that slammed into the Japanese cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Jintsu||2}}'s hull just abaft her number 2 stack and ripped her in half. There is no way of knowing for sure, but the accumulated effect of the destroyer's torpedoes and the entire task force's gunfire cost the enemy his [[flagship]] and his commander, Rear Admiral [[Shunji Izaki]].\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Kolombangara]], ''Taylor'' reported back to TF&nbsp;31 and resumed support for the amphibious operations in the central Solomons. On the night of 15&ndash;16 July, the destroyer took ''Helena'' survivors off [[Vella Lavella]] Island where they had found refuge after their ship went down. Almost a week later, on the night of 23&ndash;24 July, the destroyer supported the landings at Enogai Inlet and participated in another bombardment of Bairoko Harbor. The following morning, her main battery joined in a bombardment of the Japanese positions around the [[Munda (Solomon Islands)|Munda]] area of New Georgia.\n\n=== Aug. &ndash; Sept. 1943 ===\n\nOn 30 July, ''Taylor'' cleared Guadalcanal in company with a troop transport convoy bound for New Caledonia. She was detached en route to Noum\u00e9a and ordered to join TF&nbsp;37 at Efate. On 11 August, ''Nicholas'',\n[[USS O'Bannon (DD-450)|''O'Bannon'']] (DD-450),\n[[USS Chevalier (DD-451)|''Chevalier'']] (DD-451),\nand ''Taylor'' were ordered to return to Guadalcanal and rejoin TF&nbsp;31 for the [[Vella Lavella]] phase of the central Solomons operation. First, she covered the landings on 15 August. Two days later, the same four destroyers were ordered out of the anchorage at [[Purvis Bay]] to intercept a force of troop-laden barges covered by four destroyers. During the ensuing [[Battle off Horaniu|action off Horaniu]], a mad melee of torpedoes and gunfire, neither side lost a destroyer; but the Japanese suffered some damage when American shells set {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}} ablaze. Later, after the enemy destroyers had made good their escape, the Americans turned their attention to the scattered [[barge]]s and combat craft, sinking two [[subchaser]]s, an equal number of [[torpedo boat]]s, and one barge before retiring. Forty-eight hours later, the four American destroyers returned once again to the area northwest of Vella Lavella to seek out enemy barge traffic. They encountered nothing except enemy aircraft and dodged heavy bombing attacks throughout the evening. Over the next nine days, ''Taylor'' and her division mates made eight more trips up the \"Slot\"\u2014one of which was to cover mining operations off the west coast of Kolombangara\u2014but saw little or no action.\n\n''Taylor'' departed Guadalcanal and the Solomons on 28 August to escort [[USS Titania (AKA-13)|''Titania'']] (AKA-13) to Noum\u00e9a. Then\u2014after a ten-day repair, rest, and relaxation period in Sydney, Australia\u2014the destroyer escorted a troop transport convoy from Noum\u00e9a to Guadalcanal. She returned to the Tulagi-Purvis Bay area on 30 September and resumed support of the subjugation of Vella Lavella. By this time, the Japanese had already begun to evacuate bypassed Kolombangara and would soon make the decision to do the same at Vella Lavella. Thus, ''Taylor'' and other destroyers continued their nocturnal forays up the \"Slot\" to interdict barge traffic.\n\n===  Vella Lavella, Oct. 1943 ===\n\nOn the night of 2 October, she,\n[[USS Terry (DD-513)|''Terry'']] (DD-513), and\n[[USS Ralph Talbot (DD-390)|''Ralph&nbsp;Talbot'']] (DD-390)\nengaged enemy barges and a surface force in the waters between [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] and Kolombangara. Four nights later came the big action of the Vella Lavella and Kolombangara evacuations, the [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|Battle of Vella Lavella]]. While south of New Georgia escorting a convoy, ''Taylor'', ''Ralph&nbsp;Talbot'', and [[USS La Vallette (DD-448)|''La&nbsp;Valette'']] (DD-448) were ordered to join ''O'Bannon'', ''Chevalier'', and ''Selfridge'' already embroiled in a slugfest with nine Japanese destroyers covering the Vella Lavella evacuation group. During the ensuing battle, the American and Japanese forces traded torpedo salvoes and gunfire, as well as exchanged destroyer ''Chevalier'' for {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Y\u016bgumo|1941|2}}. During the battle, ''Selfridge'' also received a torpedo hit and ''O'Bannon'' ran into ''Chevalier''{{'}}s stern, but neither was lost. ''Taylor'' went alongside ''Selfridge'' in the closing moments of the battle and evacuated most of her crew while a skeleton crew began their successful attempt to save the damaged destroyer. She then screened the two cripples while they limped back down the \"Slot\" to Purvis Bay.\n\nOn 17 October, ''Taylor'' departed the southern Solomons with the other members of DesDiv&nbsp;41. She and her consorts escorted a convoy of troop transports to Efate, where they reported for duty with [[TF&nbsp;37]]. Between 23 and 26 October, she made a round-trip voyage between Efate and Noum\u00e9a, escorting [[USS Lassen (AE-3)|''Lassen'']] (AE-3) to Noum\u00e9a and [[USS Aldebaran (AF-10)|''Aldebaran'']] (AF-10) to Efate.\n\n=== Nov. &ndash; Dec. 1943 ===\n\n''Taylor'' and her division were reassigned to the [[Central Pacific Force]] on 31 October in preparation for the first step in the Navy's central Pacific thrust, the seizure and occupation of the [[Gilbert Islands]]. For that operation, she was assigned to the screen of TG&nbsp;50.1, built around [[Aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-16}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10}} and {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25}}.\nShe screened TG&nbsp;50.1 during the raids on [[Jaluit]] and [[Mili Atoll|Mili]] in the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]] conducted during the first half of November in preparation for the [[Gilbert Islands campaign|Gilberts assault]]. During the actual landings and occupations, she protected her charges from enemy aircraft and [[submarine]]s while their planes took off to help those of the escort carriers maintain air supremacy over the islands. Following the Gilberts operation, she steamed with the carriers during raids on the Marshall Islands. Near the end of those forays, she teamed up with ''La&nbsp;Vallette'' and {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38}} to splash two of four enemy [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kates\" which attacked the task group just after noon on 4 December.\n\n=== Feb. &ndash; May 1944 ===\n\nFollowing those raids, ''Taylor'' was ordered back to the United States for extensive yard work, arriving in [[San Francisco]] on 16 December. Repairs completed, she put to sea on 1 February 1944 and headed back to the western Pacific via [[Pearl Harbor]]. She reached [[Kwajalein]] in the Marshalls on 18 February. ''Taylor'' escorted one convoy to [[Eniwetok]] Atoll where she joined the screen of carriers\n[[USS Coral Sea (CVE-57)|''Coral Sea'']] (CVE-57) and\n[[USS Corregidor (CVE-58)|''Corregidor'']] (CVE-58)\non 29 February. The task unit cleared Eniwetok on 29 February and headed for Pearl Harbor, where it arrived on 3 March. After 12 days of training operations and repairs, the destroyer departed Pearl Harbor in the screen of\n[[USS Sangamon (CVE-26)|''Sangamon'']] (CVE-26),\n[[USS Suwannee (CVE-27)|''Suwannee'']] (CVE-27),\n[[USS Chenango (CVE-28)|''Chenango'']] (CVE-28), and\n[[USS Santee (CVE-29)|''Santee'']] (CVE-29),\nand arrived in Purvis Bay near Guadalcanal on the 27th. She remained there until 5 April when she left for [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]], for temporary duty with the [[United States 7th Fleet|7th Fleet]].\n\nThe warship reached Milne Bay on 7 April and, the following day, headed on to [[Cape Sudest]], where she became a unit of [[TF&nbsp;77]] for the amphibious assault at [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]]. During the assault, she screened aircraft carriers and acted as fighter director until 24 April when she departed to escort a convoy back to Cape Sudest. From there she moved to [[Morobe Bay]], where she spent the remainder of the month in availability alongside [[USS Dobbin (AD-3)|''Dobbin'']] (AD-3). During the first week in May, ''Taylor'' escorted a convoy from [[Cape Cretin]] to the [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] invasion area and acted as fighter director ship once more. She returned to Cape Cretin on 7 May and departed again two days later to screen a convoy of [[Tank landing ship|LST]]s to the [[Russell Islands]] subgroup in the Solomons. On 13 May, the destroyer reported back to the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet|3d Fleet]] in the Solomons, dropped off the convoy, and departed again to screen another convoy to New Caledonia.\n\n=== May &ndash; Aug. 1944 ===\n\nOn 24 May, she stood out of Noum\u00e9a in company with DesDiv&nbsp;41 to return to the Solomons and arrived at her new base of operations, [[Blanche Harbor]], on 27 May. ''Taylor'' operated out of that port in the northern Solomons and [[Bismarck Archipelago|Bismarcks]] area until early August. On the night of 28&ndash;29 May, she patrolled off [[Medina Plantation]] on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] while her sister ships bombarded the area to neutralize mobile coastal guns. From 1 to 6 June, she operated with DesDiv&nbsp;41 conducting antisubmarine operations. During the week from 7 to 14 June, ''Taylor'' and the other ships of DesDiv&nbsp;41 joined TG&nbsp;30.4 for hunter-killer antisubmarine operations. On the 10th, she depth-charged an enemy submarine, forced it to the surface, and damaged it heavily with 5&nbsp;inch and 40-mm fire. The submarine submerged again, and ''Taylor'' made two more [[depth charge]] runs and netted a probable kill. She returned to Blanche Harbor on the 15th and operated in that vicinity until the first week in August.\n\nOn 5 August, she changed operational command from the 3d Fleet to the 7th Fleet. She began her duty with that fleet with a practice bombardment of the [[Aitape]] area of New Guinea late in August and a practice landing at [[Moffin Bay]] conducted on 6 September. Both operations were in preparation for the landings made on the island of [[Morotai]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] on 15 September. For the remainder of the month, she acted as fighter director ship and as a unit of the invasion force's antisubmarine and antiaircraft screen. The destroyer also escorted convoys to the landing area until mid-October.\n\n=== Oct. &ndash; Dec. 1944 ===\n\nBetween 18 and 24 October, ''Taylor'' was a unit of the screen for the second reinforcement echelon for the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte invasion]]. During a Japanese aerial assault on the 24th, the destroyer laid a smoke screen to protect the convoy. That night, as the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] opened, ''Taylor'' and the other destroyers of her division were anchored near the entrance of [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]]. Though she did not actually join the surface engagement, ''Taylor'' joined the support force on the following morning. Following that, she patrolled the vicinity of [[Dinagat Island]] with a unit known as the \"torpedo attack force\". On 27 and 28 October, the warship screened TG&nbsp;77.4, the escort carrier group. During that duty, she rescued a downed fighter pilot of [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']] (CV-6) and a seaman from [[USS Petrof Bay (CVE-80)|''Petrof Bay'']] (CVE-80). Frequently, she helped fend off Japanese air attacks.\n\nOn 29 October, she joined TG&nbsp;77.2 and departed the area of [[Leyte Gulf]]. After visits to [[Seeadler Harbor]], [[Ulithi]] Atoll, and [[Kossol Roads]], she returned to Leyte Gulf on 16 November. Between 16 and 29 November, the destroyer continued to screen TG&nbsp;77.2 and to patrol the eastern entrance to the [[Surigao Strait]]. Again, she joined her sister ships in beating off heavy enemy air raids, climaxed by a large attack of ''[[kamikaze]]'' suicide planes and [[dive bomber]]s on the 29th. She claimed one sure kill and two assists during those raids. ''Taylor'' then cleared Leyte Gulf for almost a month at Seeadler Harbor before returning to [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] on 28 December to prepare for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]].\n\n=== Jan. &ndash; June 1945 ===\n\n''Taylor'' departed Leyte Gulf on 4 January 1945 in the screen for the cruisers in the covering force. The next day, the destroyer sighted two torpedoes running toward her formation. After giving the submarine alarm, ''Taylor'' launched a depth-charge attack on the enemy submarine\u2014a midget. Following those attacks, she rammed the small submarine and sent it on its last dive. During the Allied approach to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and in the days following the landings, the Japanese subjected ''Taylor'' and her sister ships to a series of heavy air raids. ''Taylor''{{'}}s antiaircraft gunners assisted in splashing at least two of the attackers. Through the end of January, the warship screened the cruisers and the escort carriers on patrol west of [[Luzon]].\n\nFrom early February through mid-June 1945, ''Taylor'' operated out of [[Subic Bay]] in the Philippines. Between 13 and 18 February, she participated in an extensive bombardment of [[Corregidor]] and of the [[Mariveles, Bataan#Geography|Mariveles Bay]] area of Luzon to support minesweeping operations and to pave the way for an assault by [[airborne forces|airborne]] troops. Early in March, she supported the recapture of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] on [[Mindanao]] during which the destroyer's guns helped reduce enemy shore installations. She also covered the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s while they cleared the way for the invasion force. On 15 March, ''Taylor'' returned to Corregidor where she bombarded caves on the island's western cliffs. On 26 March, the ship participated in the amphibious assault on [[Cebu Island]], where she joined\n[[USS Boise (CL-47)|''Boise'']] (CL-47),\n[[USS Phoenix (CL-46)|''Phoenix'']] (CL-46),\n[[USS Fletcher (DD-445)|''Fletcher'']] (DD-445),\n''Nicholas'',\n[[USS Jenkins (DD-447)|''Jenkins'']] (DD-447), and\n[[USS Abbot (DD-629)|''Abbot'']] (DD-629)\nin laying down a heavy pre-landing bombardment.\n\nAfter a short two-day sightseeing visit to [[Manila]], ''Taylor'' cleared the Philippines with ''Boise'', ''Phoenix'', two Australian warships, and four other American destroyers to support the amphibious landings in northeastern [[Borneo]]. En route, she captured five Japanese who were attempting to escape from [[Tawi Tawi]] on a raft. On 27 April, ''Taylor'' and her sister ships reached the vicinity of the invasion\u2014[[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Tarakan]], a small island located just off the eastern coast of Borneo and north of [[Makassar Strait]]. She operated in that area until 3 May and delivered a preinvasion bombardment and call fire. On 3 May, two days after the actual landings, she departed Tarakan to resume duty in the Philippines, where for the remainder of the month she conducted training operations.\n\n=== June &ndash; Nov. 1945 ===\n\nIn mid-June, ''Taylor'' rejoined the 3d Fleet at Leyte Gulf and, for the remainder of the war, screened various units of that fleet. During the latter part of the month, she screened aircraft carriers operating south of [[Okinawa]] which conducted air strikes on [[Sakishima Gunto]]. On 25 June, she returned to Leyte Gulf and remained there until 8 July, when she departed in the screen of TG&nbsp;30.8, the logistics group for the fast carriers of [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF&nbsp;38]]. The destroyer operated with TG&nbsp;30.8 off [[Honsh\u016b]] until 3 August when she joined the screen of one of the fast carrier task groups, TG&nbsp;38.4. On 8 August, she resumed duty with the logistics group for five days. On the 13th, ''Taylor'' rejoined TG&nbsp;38.4 just in time to be a part of the last offensive actions directed at Japan.\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities on 15 August, she patrolled off Honsh\u016b with the fast carriers.\nAdmiral William Halsey, commander of the [[US 3rd Fleet|3rd Fleet]] ordered that the destroyers from DesRon 21 be present in [[Tokyo Bay]] for Japan's surrender \"because of their valorous fight up the long road from the South Pacific to the very end.\"\nOn 23 August, ''Taylor'' and her old sisters\n''Nicholas'' and\n''O'Bannon'' formed the screen of [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] (BB-63), and as such she was one of the first American warships to enter Tokyo Bay, arriving on 29 August.\nThe destroyer was present at the surrender ceremony conducted on board ''Missouri'' on 2 September and carried Allied war correspondents to and from the ceremony. She operated in the Far East when she departed Tokyo Bay. On 7 October, she docked at Okinawa and picked up troops returning to the United States. On 18 October the Taylor dropped off her passengers at Portland, Oregon and arrived in San Francisco on 1 November and began preparations for inactivation. On 31 May 1946, the destroyer was decommissioned and placed in reserve at [[San Diego]].\n== 1951 &ndash; 1953 ==\n\nAfter four years of inactivity, ''Taylor'' moved to the [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] on 9 May 1950 and, three days later, began an extensive conversion to an [[escort destroyer]]. While still completing conversion, she was officially redesignated '''DDE-468''' on 2 January 1951. On 3 December 1951, ''Taylor'' was recommissioned at San Francisco, with Comdr. [[Sheldon H. Kinney]] in command. On 3 February 1952, she put to sea for a two-month shakedown period off San Diego. On 24 March, the escort destroyer headed west to her new [[home port]], Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on the 30th. Following two months in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], ''Taylor'' set out to return to the western Pacific for the first time since [[World War II]]. She stopped at [[Midway Atoll]] and [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], Japan, before joining TF&nbsp;77 on 16 June to screen the carriers during air operations off the Korean coast.\n\nDuring the five months that she spent in the Far East, ''Taylor'' drew several different assignments. Initially, she operated with the fast carriers and conducted bombardments of enemy-held positions along the coasts of Korea. During the second week in July, she returned to Yokosuka for upkeep and then went to sea again for exercises which included several weeks of hunter-killer operations. On 1 August, the escort destroyer rejoined TF&nbsp;77 and, in September, stood blockade watch off [[Wonsan]] for three weeks. Her blockade duty at Wonsan was far from passive for, on numerous occasions, she was called upon to shell enemy shore batteries and lines of transportation and to screen minesweepers during daily sweeps of the harbor. Late that month, ''Taylor'' headed south for a tour of duty on the [[Taiwan Strait]] Patrol during which she made a weekend port call at Hong Kong. In late October, the escort destroyer returned north to the western coast of Korea where she patrolled with two [[Royal Navy|British]] warships, the carrier {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} (R62) and the cruiser {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} (C19). On 21 November, ''Taylor'' returned to Yokosuka, completing the first leg of her voyage home.\n\nAfter conducting patrols in the [[Pacific Ocean|western Pacific]] while en route to Hawaii, ''Taylor'' entered Pearl Harbor on 8 December. Following a month of leave and upkeep, she entered the [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]] for a month of repairs. For the next three months, she conducted shakedown training in the Hawaiian Islands in order to integrate her replacements with the rest of the crew. On 2 May 1953, the warship exited Pearl Harbor to deploy to the western Pacific again. She reached Yokosuka on 12 May and, after visiting that port and [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], put to sea to join a carrier task group built around [[USS Bairoko (CVE-115)|USS ''Bairoko'']] (CVE-115) and [[HMS Ocean (R68)|HMS ''Ocean'']] (R68) off the western coast of Korea. For the most part, she screened the carriers during air operations; however, on two occasions, she patrolled close to the enemy-held shoreline to discourage the [[North Korea]]ns from attempting to take offshore islands held by [[United Nations]] forces. She returned to Sasebo on 1 June for 11 days of upkeep before heading for Okinawa and two weeks of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training. On 25 June, ''Taylor'' returned to Japan at Yokosuka, but she departed again almost immediately for duty with the Taiwan Strait Patrol. During that assignment, she visited Hong Kong once again as well as [[Kaohsiung]], where she trained sailors of the [[Republic of China Navy]]. The escort destroyer returned to Yokosuka on 20 July and, after two days of voyage repairs, departed the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 31 July and, the following day, entered the naval shipyard there for a three-month overhaul.\n\n''Taylor''{{'}}s return to Pearl Harbor coincided very closely with the formal end to hostilities in Korea. The armistice came on 27 July 1953 when she had just passed the midpoint of her voyage\u2014five days out of Yokosuka and four days from Pearl Harbor. While she saw some action during her two [[Korean War]] deployments, they occurred during the relatively quiet, final two years of the conflict. Her subsequent deployments, while they included both duty off Korea and on the Taiwan Strait Patrol, were entirely peaceful in nature until the expansion of the American role in the [[Vietnam]]ese civil war in 1965.\n\n== 1954 &ndash; 1962 ==\n\nIn the five years between 1 March 1954 and 1 March 1959, ''Taylor'' completed five more deployments to the western Pacific. During each, she conducted training exercises and made goodwill visits to Far Eastern ports. When not in the Orient, she conducted normal operations out of Pearl Harbor. During her sixth post-Korean War deployment in 1959 and 1960, she visited Australia for the celebration commemorating the victory at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor on 26 May 1960, the escort destroyer conducted normal operations again until December when she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul before deploying to the western Pacific again in August 1961. In lieu of her annual western Pacific deployment, ''Taylor'' spent the spring and summer of 1962 in the mid-Pacific as one of the support units for [[Operation Dominic]], [[nuclear weapon test|nuclear tests]] conducted in the upper atmosphere. In October, she returned to Hawaii to begin a repair period which saw her through the end of 1962. During that year, she reverted to the classification of destroyer and was re-designated '''DD-468''' on 7 August 1962.\n\n== 1962 &ndash; 1965 ==\n\nLocal operations in the Hawaiian Islands occupied the remainder of 1962 and the first six months of 1963. On 4 June 1963, the destroyer stood out of Pearl Harbor with a hunter/killer group bound for duty with the 7th Fleet. During this deployment to the Far East, ''Taylor'' called at [[Kobe]], Japan; Hong Kong; Okinawa; and [[Kushiro, Hokkaido|Kushiro]] as well as the base ports of Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Subic Bay. The call at Kushiro\u2014a fishing port on [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the northernmost of the Japanese home islands\u2014constituted ''Taylor''{{'}}s contributions to the People to People Program and aided in developing greater understanding between the peoples of the United States and Japan. Other than that, the warship engaged in numerous unilateral and bilateral training exercises through the remainder of the cruise which ended at Pearl Harbor on 29 November. ''Taylor'' operated locally in Hawaii until April 1964 when she entered [[drydock]] for a three-month overhaul. In July she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters.\n\nThose operations continued throughout most of the fall of 1964. On 23 November, the destroyer cleared Pearl Harbor in company with [[USS Yorktown (CVS-10)|''Yorktown'']] (CVS-10) and\n[[USS Thomason (DD-746)|''Thomason'']] (DD-746)\nto return to the Orient. The task unit steamed via Midway Atoll and, on 3 December, made port at Yokosuka, Japan. Four days later, she put to sea for two weeks of combined antiaircraft/ antisubmarine warfare exercises conducted with\n[[USS Hancock (CVA-19)|''Hancock'']] (CVA-19) and\n[[USS Strauss (DDG-16)|''Strauss'']] (DDG-16)\nnear Okinawa. On 19 December, the warship returned to Japan at Sasebo and remained there through the holidays and into the New Year.\n\nOn 4 January 1965, ''Taylor'' cleared Sasebo and rejoined ''Yorktown'' and ''Thomason'' for a voyage to Hong Kong. The three ships remained in the [[British Crown Colony]] for five days before clearing port for a series of special operations conducted in the [[Philippine Sea]]. At the conclusion of that duty, she put into Subic Bay on 24 February. After four days in the Philippines, ''Taylor'' headed back to Sasebo, where she arrived on 3 March. Exactly two weeks later, the destroyer got underway for the western portion of the [[South China Sea]]. She arrived off the coast of [[Vietnam]] on 21 March and patrolled there for the following five weeks. On 27 April, ''Taylor'' headed back to Yokosuka for a brief stop\u2014from 3 to 6 May\u2014before returning to Hawaii. The destroyer reentered Pearl Harbor on the 13th and conducted local operations in Hawaiian waters. On 6 December, ''Taylor'' entered the drydock for another overhaul.\n\n== 1965 &ndash; 1967 ==\n\nThe destroyer left the dock in mid-January 1965 and stood out of Pearl Harbor on 7 February and, with the other ships of DesDiv&nbsp;111, shaped a course for the western Pacific. The warship reached Yokosuka 10 days later and spent eight days undergoing voyage repairs. On 25 February, she departed Yokosuka to join Task Group 70.4 off the coast of Vietnam the following day. She patrolled Vietnamese waters until the [[Ides of March]], when she headed north to patrol the Taiwan Strait. During her stay in the area around [[Taiwan]], she visited Kaohsiung. Her relief arrived on 12 April, and ''Taylor'' steamed off to Hong Kong for a five-day port call. On the 21st, she returned to [[Yankee Station]] to resume operations in support of American and [[South Vietnam]]ese forces ashore. Among other tasks, she brought her main battery to bear on the enemy and rendered naval gunfire support between 28 April and 1 May. She conducted upkeep at Sasebo in May and ASW drills from 26 May to 10 June before resuming patrols in the Taiwan Strait on the 11th ( during operation Sand Pan she started to tie up at Da Nang then incoming we quickly pulled away and were request to render gun fire on co-ordnance given one shot hit objective then we sail north for more Sand Pan duty). She cleared the area again on 5 July, rejoined TG&nbsp;70.4 on 7 July, and put into Yokosuka the following day. After a week of preparations, the warship departed Yokosuka to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 22 July.\n\nOn 2 August 1965, ''Taylor'' began a tender availability period alongside [[USS Prairie (AD-15)|''Prairie'']] (AD-15) which lasted through the end of the month. Following a short cruise for gunnery practice, ''Taylor'' commenced a restricted availability which lasted until late in November. During the first two weeks in December, the destroyer made a round-trip voyage to [[Pago Pago]], [[American Samoa]]. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 December for holiday leave and upkeep. During the first three months of 1967, the ship conducted local operations around Hawaii, made repairs, and generally prepared to return to the Far East in late spring.\n\nFollowing an Operational Readiness Inspection in mid-April, she cleared Pearl Harbor on the 18th to join the 7th Fleet in the Orient. On 25 April, she changed operational control from the [[U.S. 1st Fleet|1st Fleet]] to the 7th and, three days later, steamed into Yokosuka. During the first half of June, the destroyer participated in exercises with units of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] and ships of the [[Republic of Korea Navy]]. After two days in port at Sasebo, she got underway on 19 June for her first line period on Yankee Station. Between 22 May and 25 June, she plied the waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], plane-guarding for [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''Hornet'']] (CV-12) and providing gunfire support for Allied forces operating ashore. On 27 June, ''Taylor'' put into Subic Bay. After a tender availability at Subic Bay and a visit to Manila, she put to sea on 10 July to participate in [[SEATO]] exercise \"Sea Dog.\" Between the 26th and the 28th, she visited [[Bang Saen]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. After three more days on Yankee Station\u2014from 28 July to 1 August\u2014   the destroyer made for Taiwan. She reached Kaohsiung on 3 August and remained until 15 August, when she headed back to the coast of Vietnam, Yankee Station sand pan operation. From 19 August to 11 September, she cruised along the Vietnamese coast providing naval gunfire support as needed by the forces operating ashore. She cleared the coast of [[Indochina]] on the 12th, and, after a five-day stop at Hong Kong and another tour of duty in the Gulf of Tonkin, she returned to Yokosuka on 11 October. Five days later, she shaped a course back to Hawaii.\n\n== 1968 &ndash; 1969 ==\n\n''Taylor'' arrived in Pearl Harbor on 23 October, and the destroyer commenced her regular overhaul on 11 December. Repairs and modifications occupied her time through the first three months of 1968. The warship completed overhaul on 22 March and conducted sea trials during the first week in April. Later, engineering problems forced the postponement of further operations until the end of the month. At that time, she began preparations for refresher training. The warship conducted refresher training in May and June, then got underway for [[Naval Station San Diego|San Diego]], [[California|Calif.]], on 27 June. She conducted operations\u2014primarily gunnery drills at [[San Clemente Island]]\u2014from 3 to 11 July. On the latter date, she headed back to Hawaii. En route, ''Taylor'' conducted bombardment exercises at [[Kahoolawe Island]] and then entered Pearl Harbor on the 17th. Three weeks later, the destroyer cleared Pearl Harbor on 5 August and set course for the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\nAfter fueling stops at Midway, [[Guam]], and Subic Bay, she arrived on station off Vietnam on 21 August. ''Taylor'' did plane guard duty for\n[[USS Intrepid (CVS-11)|''Intrepid'']] (CVS-11)\nfor a day; then steamed off with the carrier and destroyers\n[[USS Maddox (DD-731)|''Maddox'']] (DD-731) and\n[[USS Preston (DD-795)|''Preston'']] (DD-795)\ntoward Sasebo. She returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 5 September and conducted air and surface surveillance as well as antisubmarine warfare exercises in addition to planeguarding for the carriers. On the 19th, the destroyer moved in closer to the coast to provide naval gunfire in support of troops ashore. That duty continued until 6 October when she cleared the combat zone to return to Subic Bay for repairs, supplies, and ammunition. On 20 October, the warship took up where she left off and began a week pounding various targets in Vietnam. That line period was followed by visits to [[Cebu City]] and Subic Bay in the Philippines. During late November and early December, she resumed duty on the gunline. On 4 December, she cleared the combat zone and set a course through the [[Luzon Strait]] to Yokosuka, where she arrived on the 12th. She spent [[Christmas]] in Yokosuka, but returned to Yankee Station by New Year's Day 1969.\n\nIn mid-January, she departed Vietnamese waters for the last time. After stops at Subic Bay; [[Manus Island]]; [[Melbourne]], Australia; [[Auckland]], New Zealand; and Pago Pago, [[Samoa]], the warship arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 28 February. In May, a board of inspection and survey looked her over and determined that she was unfit for further naval service. Early in June, ''Taylor'' was moved to San Diego, California, and was decommissioned on 3 June 1969. Her name was struck from the [[Navy list]] on 2 July 1969, and she was transferred to Italy at the same time. The former American destroyer served in the [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy]] as ''Lanciere'' D 560 until January 1971. She was subsequently cannibalized to maintain her sister ships still serving in the Italian Navy.\n\n==Honors==\n''Taylor'' earned 15 [[battle star]]s during [[World War II]], ranking her among the [[most decorated US ships of World War II]]. In addition, she earned two battle stars for her [[Korean War]] service, and six battle stars for her [[Vietnam War]] service.\n\n==See also==\nSee [[USS Taylor|USS ''Taylor'']] for other ships of the same name.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/taylor-ii.html}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|USS Taylor (DD-468)}}\n*[http://usstaylor468.org/ ''Taylor'' Sailors website]\n*[http://destroyerhistory.org/fletcherclass/usstaylor/ USS ''Taylor'' website] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation]\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/468.htm   navsource.org: USS ''Taylor'']\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd468txt.htm  hazegray.org: USS ''Taylor'']\n <!-- non-breaking space to keep AWB drones from altering the space before the navbox-->\n\n{{Fletcher class destroyer|others}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor (Dd-468)}}\n[[Category:Fletcher-class destroyers of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine]]\n[[Category:1942 ships]]\n[[Category:World War II destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Korean War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Navy Rhode Island-related ships]]\n[[Category:Fante-class destroyers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other ships|USS Taylor|Italian destroyer Lanciere}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=[[File:Usstaylor dd468 dht.jpg|300px|USS Taylor (DD-468), 1944.]]\n|Ship caption=USS Taylor (DD-468), 1944.\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Ship country=United States\n|Ship flag={{USN flag|1969}}\n|Ship name=\n|Ship namesake=[[William Rogers Taylor]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Bath Iron Works]]\n|Ship laid down= 28 August 1941\n|Ship launched=7 June 1942\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship commissioned=28 August 1942\n|Ship decommissioned= 3 June 1969\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck=2 July 1969\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship fate=*Transferred to Italy,\n*2 July 1969\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Ship country=Italy\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Italy|naval}}\n|Ship name=Lanciere\n|Ship namesake=\n|Ship acquired=2 July 1969\n|Ship commissioned=\n|Ship decommissioned=   January 1971\n|Ship in service=\n|Ship out of service=\n|Ship struck= January 1971\n|Ship reinstated=\n|Ship honours=\n|Ship fate= Cannibalized for parts\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class={{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer}}\n|Ship displacement=2,050&nbsp;tons\n|Ship length=376&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in (114.7&nbsp;m)\n|Ship beam=39&nbsp;ft 8&nbsp;in (12.1&nbsp;m)\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=17&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;in (5.4&nbsp;m)\n|Ship propulsion=60,000&nbsp;shp (45&nbsp;MW); 2 propellers\n|Ship speed={{convert|35|kn|lk=in}}\n|Ship range=6500 [[nautical mile|nmi.]] (12,000&nbsp;km) at 15&nbsp;kt\n|Ship complement=336\n|Ship sensors=\n|Ship EW=\n|Ship armament= {{Fletcher class destroyer armament}}\n|Ship armour=\n|Ship armor=\n|Ship aircraft=\n|Ship aircraft facilities=\n|Ship notes=\n}}\n|}\n\n'''USS ''Taylor'' (DD/DDE-468)''' was a {{sclass-|Fletcher|destroyer}} of the [[United States Navy]], named for Rear Admiral [[William Rogers Taylor]] (1811&ndash;1889). She was laid down on 28 August 1941 at [[Bath, Maine]], by the [[Bath Iron Works]] Corp.; [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 7 June 1942, sponsored by Mrs. H. A. Baldridge; and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 28 August 1942 at the [[Charlestown Navy Yard]] near [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston, Mass.]], Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Katz in command.\n\n''Taylor'' was the first [[destroyer]] to anchor in Japanese coastal waters at the end of [[World War II]] \u2013 one that, wrote Admiral [[William F. Halsey]], \"admirably performed every mission assigned to her.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = USS TAYLOR (DD DDE 468)|url = http://usstaylor468.org/|website = USS TAYLOR (DD DDE 468)|access-date = 2016-01-24}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n== World War II ==\n\n''Taylor'' began her naval career with the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]]. Assigned to [[Destroyer Squadron 20]] (DESRON TWO ZERO), the destroyer trained at [[Casco Bay]], [[Maine]], and made her shakedown cruise in the northern Atlantic before beginning duty as a coastwise [[convoy]] escort. The latter duty lasted until mid-November when she escorted a transatlantic convoy to a point just off [[Casablanca]]. The transit was uneventful, save for the interception of a Spanish merchantman, SS ''Darro''. A boarding party from ''Taylor'' sent the neutral ship off to [[Gibraltar]] to prevent her from transmitting information about the convoy to the enemy. ''Taylor'' returned to the United States at [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]] early in December and remained there until mid-month.\n\n===  Rennell Island, Jan. 1943 ===\n\nOn 17 December, the warship cleared [[Hampton Roads]] in company with [[Task Force 13]] (TF&nbsp;13) on her way to duty with the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]]. After transiting the [[Panama Canal]] and stopping at [[Tutuila]] in the [[Samoan Islands]], the destroyer reported at [[Noumea]], [[New Caledonia]], on 20 January 1943 for duty in the [[South West Pacific Area]]. From Noum\u00e9a, ''Taylor'' continued west to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]] group, entering Havannah Harbor on the 26th. There, she became a unit of [[Destroyer Squadron 21]]'s Destroyer Division 41 (DesDiv&nbsp;41), one of two four-destroyer divisions screening Rear Admiral [[Robert C. Giffen]]'s [[Task Force 18]], comprising three [[heavy cruiser]]s, three [[light cruiser]]s, and two [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]]s.\n\nOn 27 January, ''Taylor'' cleared [[Havannah Harbor]] with the other ships of TF&nbsp;18, one of several task forces sent out to screen an important reinforcement echelon to [[Guadalcanal]]. Admiral [[William Halsey, Jr.|William Halsey]], operating upon intelligence which indicated a major Japanese attempt to reinforce their beleaguered garrison on the island, sent out the large screening force in the hope and expectation of a major naval engagement. That sea battle never materialized because the enemy activities upon which he predicated his actions were actually movements preparatory to a Japanese withdrawal. Instead, at the [[battle of Rennell Island]], the enemy subjected TF&nbsp;18 to a scathing air attack. On the evening of 29 January, enemy [[Mitsubishi G4M]] \"Betty\" bombers attacked TF&nbsp;18 with [[torpedo]]es. The ships brushed off the first attack with antiaircraft fire, suffered negligible damage, and raced on to rendezvous with the other elements of the covering force. After a concerted effort, the Japanese fliers finally scored a crippling torpedo hit on {{USS|Chicago|CA-29|2}} (CA-29). When {{USS|Louisville|CA-28|2}} (CA-28) took the stricken cruiser in tow, ''Taylor'' helped to screen the retiring ships as they steamed out of range of enemy aircraft. The following day, more enemy planes appeared and attacked. After ''Chicago'' took four more torpedo hits, her crew and the warships covering her abandoned the heavy cruiser to her watery fate and returned to Efate.\n\n=== Feb. &ndash; April 1943 ===\n\nOn 4 February, ''Taylor'' and the other ships of DesRon 21 were transferred to TF&nbsp;67, Rear Admiral [[Walden L. Ainsworth]]'s cruiser-destroyer force. Soon thereafter, TF&nbsp;67 became TF&nbsp;18, and the former TF&nbsp;18 became TF&nbsp;19. In any event, during February and March, ''Taylor'' screened Ainsworth's\ncruisers\u2014[[USS St. Louis (CL-49)|''St. Louis'']] (CL-49),\n[[USS Honolulu (CL-48)|''Honolulu'']] (CL-48), and\n[[USS Helena (CL-50)|''Helena'']] (CL-50)\u2014during\noperations between [[Espiritu Santo]] and Guadalcanal. During the night of 15&ndash;16 March, she joined\n[[USS Nicholas (DD-449)|''Nicholas'']] (DD-449),\n[[USS Radford (DD-446)|''Radford'']] (DD-446), and\n[[USS Strong (DD-467)|''Strong'']] (DD-467)\nin the fourth bombardment of the [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila-Stanmore Plantation]] located on [[Kolombangara]] Island in the central [[Solomon Islands]]. On 26 March, the destroyer cleared Espiritu Santo to escort\n[[USS Kanawha (AO-1)|''Kanawha'']] (AO-1),\n[[USS Aloe (YN-1)|''Aloe'']] (YN-1),\nand six coastal transports to Guadalcanal. The ships reached [[Tulagi]] on the 29th; and, while ''Kanawha'' discharged cargo, ''Taylor'' resumed operations at sea with Ainsworth's cruisers.\n\nOn the nights of 4, 5, and 6 April, she joined them in sweeps up \"[[the Slot]]\" before being ordered back to Tulagi on the 7th to pick up ''Kanawha''. When the destroyer was just about to enter Tulagi, a strong Japanese air raid cancelled her mission by severely bombing ''Kanawha'' before the old oiler could clear the harbor completely. With ''Kanawha'' disabled, ''Taylor'' rang up 30&nbsp;knots and cleared the area via [[Sealark Channel]]. During her transit of the channel, the warship claimed the destruction of three enemy planes and hits on two others.\n\nFor much of the month, ''Taylor'' escorted convoys in the Solomons and between those islands and Espiritu Santo. On 20 April, she rejoined TF&nbsp;18. After a brief tender overhaul, the destroyer accompanied the cruisers up the \"Slot\" twice during the 10 days between 4 and 14 May to cover [[Naval mine|mining]] operations in [[Vella Gulf]]. During the second operation, conducted between the 11th and the 14th, she and the other warships bombarded enemy installations at [[Vila, Solomon Islands|Vila]], [[Bairoko Harbor]], and [[Enogai Inlet]].\n\n=== May &ndash; July 1943 ===\n\nBetween late May and early July, ''Taylor'' performed escort duty. On 25 May, she cleared Espiritu Santo with [[USS Munargo (AP-20)|''Munargo'']] (AP-20), escorted the transport to the [[180th meridian]], and returned to Espiritu Santo on the 30th. During her next assignment\u2014escorting a convoy of troop transports to Guadalcanal and back\u2014she defended her charges against Japanese planes which jumped the task unit on 10 June south of [[Makira|San Cristobal]]. After repairs at Espiritu Santo, she served with the [[anti-submarine warfare|antisubmarine]] screen of escort carrier [[USS Sangamon (ACV-26)|''Sangamon'']] (ACV-26) until 6 July when she headed for Tulagi to report for duty with TF&nbsp;31.\n\nFor the next four months, ''Taylor'' supported the invasions of the central Solomons. In July, she supported the [[New Georgia]] landings. On the 11th and 12th, the destroyer covered the landing of troops and supplies at [[Rice Anchorage]] on [[Kula Gulf]] as well as the evacuation of wounded. On the morning of the 12th, she attacked and damaged a Japanese [[Ro-type submarine]], but could claim no definite sinking. That afternoon, ''Taylor'' was temporarily detached from TF&nbsp;31 and assigned to TF&nbsp;18. She headed up the \"Slot\" with Ainsworth's cruisers\u2014the same ones with which she had previously served except that {{HMNZS|Leander}} replaced ''Helena'' after the latter cruiser was lost in the [[Battle of Kula Gulf]]\u2014to intercept a Japanese surface force. That evening, the two forces collided. ''Taylor'' and the other van destroyers launched torpedoes and then joined the remainder of TF&nbsp;18 in engaging the enemy with their guns. It may well have been one of ''Taylor''{{'}}s \"fish\" that slammed into the Japanese cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Jintsu||2}}'s hull just abaft her number 2 stack and ripped her in half. There is no way of knowing for sure, but the accumulated effect of the destroyer's torpedoes and the entire task force's gunfire cost the enemy his [[flagship]] and his commander, Rear Admiral [[Shunji Izaki]].\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Kolombangara]], ''Taylor'' reported back to TF&nbsp;31 and resumed support for the amphibious operations in the central Solomons. On the night of 15&ndash;16 July, the destroyer took ''Helena'' survivors off [[Vella Lavella]] Island where they had found refuge after their ship went down. Almost a week later, on the night of 23&ndash;24 July, the destroyer supported the landings at Enogai Inlet and participated in another bombardment of Bairoko Harbor. The following morning, her main battery joined in a bombardment of the Japanese positions around the [[Munda (Solomon Islands)|Munda]] area of New Georgia.\n\n=== Aug. &ndash; Sept. 1943 ===\n\nOn 30 July, ''Taylor'' cleared Guadalcanal in company with a troop transport convoy bound for New Caledonia. She was detached en route to Noum\u00e9a and ordered to join TF&nbsp;37 at Efate. On 11 August, ''Nicholas'',\n[[USS O'Bannon (DD-450)|''O'Bannon'']] (DD-450),\n[[USS Chevalier (DD-451)|''Chevalier'']] (DD-451),\nand ''Taylor'' were ordered to return to Guadalcanal and rejoin TF&nbsp;31 for the Vella Lavella phase of the central Solomons operation. First, she covered the landings on 15 August. Two days later, the same four destroyers were ordered out of the anchorage at [[Purvis Bay]] to intercept a force of troop-laden barges covered by four destroyers. During the ensuing [[Battle off Horaniu|action off Horaniu]], a mad melee of torpedoes and gunfire, neither side lost a destroyer; but the Japanese suffered some damage when American shells set {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hamakaze|1940|2}} ablaze. Later, after the enemy destroyers had made good their escape, the Americans turned their attention to the scattered [[barge]]s and combat craft, sinking two [[subchaser]]s, an equal number of [[torpedo boat]]s, and one barge before retiring. Forty-eight hours later, the four American destroyers returned once again to the area northwest of Vella Lavella to seek out enemy barge traffic. They encountered nothing except enemy aircraft and dodged heavy bombing attacks throughout the evening. Over the next nine days, ''Taylor'' and her division mates made eight more trips up the \"Slot\"\u2014one of which was to cover mining operations off the west coast of Kolombangara\u2014but saw little or no action.\n\n''Taylor'' departed Guadalcanal and the Solomons on 28 August to escort [[USS Titania (AKA-13)|''Titania'']] (AKA-13) to Noum\u00e9a. Then\u2014after a ten-day repair, rest, and relaxation period in Sydney, Australia\u2014the destroyer escorted a troop transport convoy from Noum\u00e9a to Guadalcanal. She returned to the Tulagi-Purvis Bay area on 30 September and resumed support of the subjugation of Vella Lavella. By this time, the Japanese had already begun to evacuate bypassed Kolombangara and would soon make the decision to do the same at Vella Lavella. Thus, ''Taylor'' and other destroyers continued their nocturnal forays up the \"Slot\" to interdict barge traffic.\n\n===  Vella Lavella, Oct. 1943 ===\n\nOn the night of 2 October, she,\n[[USS Terry (DD-513)|''Terry'']] (DD-513), and\n[[USS Ralph Talbot (DD-390)|''Ralph&nbsp;Talbot'']] (DD-390)\nengaged enemy barges and a surface force in the waters between [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]] and Kolombangara. Four nights later came the big action of the Vella Lavella and Kolombangara evacuations, the [[Naval Battle of Vella Lavella|Battle of Vella Lavella]]. While south of New Georgia escorting a convoy, ''Taylor'', ''Ralph&nbsp;Talbot'', and [[USS La Vallette (DD-448)|''La&nbsp;Valette'']] (DD-448) were ordered to join ''O'Bannon'', ''Chevalier'', and ''Selfridge'' already embroiled in a slugfest with nine Japanese destroyers covering the Vella Lavella evacuation group. During the ensuing battle, the American and Japanese forces traded torpedo salvoes and gunfire, as well as exchanged destroyer ''Chevalier'' for {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Y\u016bgumo|1941|2}}. During the battle, ''Selfridge'' also received a torpedo hit and ''O'Bannon'' ran into ''Chevalier''{{'}}s stern, but neither was lost. ''Taylor'' went alongside ''Selfridge'' in the closing moments of the battle and evacuated most of her crew while a skeleton crew began their successful attempt to save the damaged destroyer. She then screened the two cripples while they limped back down the \"Slot\" to Purvis Bay.\n\nOn 17 October, ''Taylor'' departed the southern Solomons with the other members of DesDiv&nbsp;41. She and her consorts escorted a convoy of troop transports to Efate, where they reported for duty with [[TF&nbsp;37]]. Between 23 and 26 October, she made a round-trip voyage between Efate and Noum\u00e9a, escorting [[USS Lassen (AE-3)|''Lassen'']] (AE-3) to Noum\u00e9a and [[USS Aldebaran (AF-10)|''Aldebaran'']] (AF-10) to Efate.\n\n=== Nov. &ndash; Dec. 1943 ===\n\n''Taylor'' and her division were reassigned to the [[Central Pacific Force]] on 31 October in preparation for the first step in the Navy's central Pacific thrust, the seizure and occupation of the [[Gilbert Islands]]. For that operation, she was assigned to the screen of TG&nbsp;50.1, built around [[Aircraft carrier|carriers]] {{USS|Lexington|CV-16}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10}} and {{USS|Cowpens|CVL-25}}.\nShe screened TG&nbsp;50.1 during the raids on [[Jaluit]] and [[Mili Atoll|Mili]] in the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]] conducted during the first half of November in preparation for the [[Gilbert Islands campaign|Gilberts assault]]. During the actual landings and occupations, she protected her charges from enemy aircraft and [[submarine]]s while their planes took off to help those of the escort carriers maintain air supremacy over the islands. Following the Gilberts operation, she steamed with the carriers during raids on the Marshall Islands. Near the end of those forays, she teamed up with ''La&nbsp;Vallette'' and {{USS|San Francisco|CA-38}} to splash two of four enemy [[Nakajima B5N]] \"Kates\" which attacked the task group just after noon on 4 December.\n\n=== Feb. &ndash; May 1944 ===\n\nFollowing those raids, ''Taylor'' was ordered back to the United States for extensive yard work, arriving in [[San Francisco]] on 16 December. Repairs completed, she put to sea on 1 February 1944 and headed back to the western Pacific via [[Pearl Harbor]]. She reached [[Kwajalein]] in the Marshalls on 18 February. ''Taylor'' escorted one convoy to [[Eniwetok]] Atoll where she joined the screen of carriers\n[[USS Coral Sea (CVE-57)|''Coral Sea'']] (CVE-57) and\n[[USS Corregidor (CVE-58)|''Corregidor'']] (CVE-58)\non 29 February. The task unit cleared Eniwetok on 29 February and headed for Pearl Harbor, where it arrived on 3 March. After 12 days of training operations and repairs, the destroyer departed Pearl Harbor in the screen of\n[[USS Sangamon (CVE-26)|''Sangamon'']] (CVE-26),\n[[USS Suwannee (CVE-27)|''Suwannee'']] (CVE-27),\n[[USS Chenango (CVE-28)|''Chenango'']] (CVE-28), and\n[[USS Santee (CVE-29)|''Santee'']] (CVE-29),\nand arrived in Purvis Bay near Guadalcanal on the 27th. She remained there until 5 April when she left for [[Milne Bay]], [[New Guinea]], for temporary duty with the [[United States 7th Fleet|7th Fleet]].\n\nThe warship reached Milne Bay on 7 April and, the following day, headed on to [[Cape Sudest]], where she became a unit of [[TF&nbsp;77]] for the amphibious assault at [[Teluk Yos Sudarso|Humboldt Bay]]. During the assault, she screened aircraft carriers and acted as fighter director until 24 April when she departed to escort a convoy back to Cape Sudest. From there she moved to [[Morobe Bay]], where she spent the remainder of the month in availability alongside [[USS Dobbin (AD-3)|''Dobbin'']] (AD-3). During the first week in May, ''Taylor'' escorted a convoy from [[Cape Cretin]] to the [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] invasion area and acted as fighter director ship once more. She returned to Cape Cretin on 7 May and departed again two days later to screen a convoy of [[Tank landing ship|LST]]s to the [[Russell Islands]] subgroup in the Solomons. On 13 May, the destroyer reported back to the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet|3d Fleet]] in the Solomons, dropped off the convoy, and departed again to screen another convoy to New Caledonia.\n\n=== May &ndash; Aug. 1944 ===\n\nOn 24 May, she stood out of Noum\u00e9a in company with DesDiv&nbsp;41 to return to the Solomons and arrived at her new base of operations, [[Blanche Harbor]], on 27 May. ''Taylor'' operated out of that port in the northern Solomons and [[Bismarck Archipelago|Bismarcks]] area until early August. On the night of 28&ndash;29 May, she patrolled off [[Medina Plantation]] on [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] while her sister ships bombarded the area to neutralize mobile coastal guns. From 1 to 6 June, she operated with DesDiv&nbsp;41 conducting antisubmarine operations. During the week from 7 to 14 June, ''Taylor'' and the other ships of DesDiv&nbsp;41 joined TG&nbsp;30.4 for hunter-killer antisubmarine operations. On the 10th, she depth-charged an enemy submarine, forced it to the surface, and damaged it heavily with 5&nbsp;inch and 40-mm fire. The submarine submerged again, and ''Taylor'' made two more [[depth charge]] runs and netted a probable kill. She returned to Blanche Harbor on the 15th and operated in that vicinity until the first week in August.\n\nOn 5 August, she changed operational command from the 3d Fleet to the 7th Fleet. She began her duty with that fleet with a practice bombardment of the [[Aitape]] area of New Guinea late in August and a practice landing at [[Moffin Bay]] conducted on 6 September. Both operations were in preparation for the landings made on the island of [[Morotai]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] on 15 September. For the remainder of the month, she acted as fighter director ship and as a unit of the invasion force's antisubmarine and antiaircraft screen. The destroyer also escorted convoys to the landing area until mid-October.\n\n=== Oct. &ndash; Dec. 1944 ===\n\nBetween 18 and 24 October, ''Taylor'' was a unit of the screen for the second reinforcement echelon for the [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte invasion]]. During a Japanese aerial assault on the 24th, the destroyer laid a smoke screen to protect the convoy. That night, as the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]] opened, ''Taylor'' and the other destroyers of her division were anchored near the entrance of [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]]. Though she did not actually join the surface engagement, ''Taylor'' joined the support force on the following morning. Following that, she patrolled the vicinity of [[Dinagat Island]] with a unit known as the \"torpedo attack force\". On 27 and 28 October, the warship screened TG&nbsp;77.4, the escort carrier group. During that duty, she rescued a downed fighter pilot of [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']] (CV-6) and a seaman from [[USS Petrof Bay (CVE-80)|''Petrof Bay'']] (CVE-80). Frequently, she helped fend off Japanese air attacks.\n\nOn 29 October, she joined TG&nbsp;77.2 and departed the area of [[Leyte Gulf]]. After visits to [[Seeadler Harbor]], [[Ulithi]] Atoll, and [[Kossol Roads]], she returned to Leyte Gulf on 16 November. Between 16 and 29 November, the destroyer continued to screen TG&nbsp;77.2 and to patrol the eastern entrance to the [[Surigao Strait]]. Again, she joined her sister ships in beating off heavy enemy air raids, climaxed by a large attack of ''[[kamikaze]]'' suicide planes and [[dive bomber]]s on the 29th. She claimed one sure kill and two assists during those raids. ''Taylor'' then cleared Leyte Gulf for almost a month at Seeadler Harbor before returning to [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] on 28 December to prepare for the [[Battle of Luzon|invasion of Luzon]].\n\n=== Jan. &ndash; June 1945 ===\n\n''Taylor'' departed Leyte Gulf on 4 January 1945 in the screen for the cruisers in the covering force. The next day, the destroyer sighted two torpedoes running toward her formation. After giving the submarine alarm, ''Taylor'' launched a depth-charge attack on the enemy submarine\u2014a midget. Following those attacks, she rammed the small submarine and sent it on its last dive. During the Allied approach to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and in the days following the landings, the Japanese subjected ''Taylor'' and her sister ships to a series of heavy air raids. ''Taylor''{{'}}s antiaircraft gunners assisted in splashing at least two of the attackers. Through the end of January, the warship screened the cruisers and the escort carriers on patrol west of [[Luzon]].\n\nFrom early February through mid-June 1945, ''Taylor'' operated out of [[Subic Bay]] in the Philippines. Between 13 and 18 February, she participated in an extensive bombardment of [[Corregidor]] and of the [[Mariveles, Bataan#Geography|Mariveles Bay]] area of Luzon to support minesweeping operations and to pave the way for an assault by [[airborne forces|airborne]] troops. Early in March, she supported the recapture of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] on [[Mindanao]] during which the destroyer's guns helped reduce enemy shore installations. She also covered the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]]s while they cleared the way for the invasion force. On 15 March, ''Taylor'' returned to Corregidor where she bombarded caves on the island's western cliffs. On 26 March, the ship participated in the amphibious assault on [[Cebu Island]], where she joined\n[[USS Boise (CL-47)|''Boise'']] (CL-47),\n[[USS Phoenix (CL-46)|''Phoenix'']] (CL-46),\n[[USS Fletcher (DD-445)|''Fletcher'']] (DD-445),\n''Nicholas'',\n[[USS Jenkins (DD-447)|''Jenkins'']] (DD-447), and\n[[USS Abbot (DD-629)|''Abbot'']] (DD-629)\nin laying down a heavy pre-landing bombardment.\n\nAfter a short two-day sightseeing visit to [[Manila]], ''Taylor'' cleared the Philippines with ''Boise'', ''Phoenix'', two Australian warships, and four other American destroyers to support the amphibious landings in northeastern [[Borneo]]. En route, she captured five Japanese who were attempting to escape from [[Tawi Tawi]] on a raft. On 27 April, ''Taylor'' and her sister ships reached the vicinity of the invasion\u2014[[Battle of Tarakan (1945)|Tarakan]], a small island located just off the eastern coast of Borneo and north of [[Makassar Strait]]. She operated in that area until 3 May and delivered a preinvasion bombardment and call fire. On 3 May, two days after the actual landings, she departed Tarakan to resume duty in the Philippines, where for the remainder of the month she conducted training operations.\n\n=== June &ndash; Nov. 1945 ===\n\nIn mid-June, ''Taylor'' rejoined the 3d Fleet at Leyte Gulf and, for the remainder of the war, screened various units of that fleet. During the latter part of the month, she screened aircraft carriers operating south of [[Okinawa]] which conducted air strikes on [[Sakishima Gunto]]. On 25 June, she returned to Leyte Gulf and remained there until 8 July, when she departed in the screen of TG&nbsp;30.8, the logistics group for the fast carriers of [[Fast Carrier Task Force|TF&nbsp;38]]. The destroyer operated with TG&nbsp;30.8 off [[Honsh\u016b]] until 3 August when she joined the screen of one of the fast carrier task groups, TG&nbsp;38.4. On 8 August, she resumed duty with the logistics group for five days. On the 13th, ''Taylor'' rejoined TG&nbsp;38.4 just in time to be a part of the last offensive actions directed at Japan.\n\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities on 15 August, she patrolled off Honsh\u016b with the fast carriers.\nAdmiral William Halsey, commander of the [[US 3rd Fleet|3rd Fleet]] ordered that the destroyers from DesRon 21 be present in [[Tokyo Bay]] for Japan's surrender \"because of their valorous fight up the long road from the South Pacific to the very end.\"\nOn 23 August, ''Taylor'' and her old sisters\n''Nicholas'' and\n''O'Bannon'' formed the screen of [[USS Missouri (BB-63)|''Missouri'']] (BB-63), and as such she was one of the first American warships to enter Tokyo Bay, arriving on 29 August.\nThe destroyer was present at the surrender ceremony conducted on board ''Missouri'' on 2 September and carried Allied war correspondents to and from the ceremony. She operated in the Far East when she departed Tokyo Bay. On 7 October, she docked at Okinawa and picked up troops returning to the United States. On 18 October the Taylor dropped off her passengers at Portland, Oregon and arrived in San Francisco on 1 November and began preparations for inactivation. On 31 May 1946, the destroyer was decommissioned and placed in reserve at [[San Diego]].\n== 1951 &ndash; 1953 ==\n\nAfter four years of inactivity, ''Taylor'' moved to the [[San Francisco Naval Shipyard]] on 9 May 1950 and, three days later, began an extensive conversion to an [[escort destroyer]]. While still completing conversion, she was officially redesignated '''DDE-468''' on 2 January 1951. On 3 December 1951, ''Taylor'' was recommissioned at San Francisco, with Comdr. [[Sheldon H. Kinney]] in command. On 3 February 1952, she put to sea for a two-month shakedown period off San Diego. On 24 March, the escort destroyer headed west to her new [[home port]], Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on the 30th. Following two months in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], ''Taylor'' set out to return to the western Pacific for the first time since [[World War II]]. She stopped at [[Midway Atoll]] and [[U.S. Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], Japan, before joining TF&nbsp;77 on 16 June to screen the carriers during air operations off the Korean coast.\n\nDuring the five months that she spent in the Far East, ''Taylor'' drew several different assignments. Initially, she operated with the fast carriers and conducted bombardments of enemy-held positions along the coasts of Korea. During the second week in July, she returned to Yokosuka for upkeep and then went to sea again for exercises which included several weeks of hunter-killer operations. On 1 August, the escort destroyer rejoined TF&nbsp;77 and, in September, stood blockade watch off [[Wonsan]] for three weeks. Her blockade duty at Wonsan was far from passive for, on numerous occasions, she was called upon to shell enemy shore batteries and lines of transportation and to screen minesweepers during daily sweeps of the harbor. Late that month, ''Taylor'' headed south for a tour of duty on the [[Taiwan Strait]] Patrol during which she made a weekend port call at Hong Kong. In late October, the escort destroyer returned north to the western coast of Korea where she patrolled with two [[Royal Navy|British]] warships, the carrier {{HMS|Glory|R62|6}} (R62) and the cruiser {{HMS|Birmingham|C19|6}} (C19). On 21 November, ''Taylor'' returned to Yokosuka, completing the first leg of her voyage home.\n\nAfter conducting patrols in the [[Pacific Ocean|western Pacific]] while en route to Hawaii, ''Taylor'' entered Pearl Harbor on 8 December. Following a month of leave and upkeep, she entered the [[Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard]] for a month of repairs. For the next three months, she conducted shakedown training in the Hawaiian Islands in order to integrate her replacements with the rest of the crew. On 2 May 1953, the warship exited Pearl Harbor to deploy to the western Pacific again. She reached Yokosuka on 12 May and, after visiting that port and [[United States Fleet Activities Sasebo|Sasebo]], put to sea to join a carrier task group built around [[USS Bairoko (CVE-115)|USS ''Bairoko'']] (CVE-115) and [[HMS Ocean (R68)|HMS ''Ocean'']] (R68) off the western coast of Korea. For the most part, she screened the carriers during air operations; however, on two occasions, she patrolled close to the enemy-held shoreline to discourage the [[North Korea]]ns from attempting to take offshore islands held by [[United Nations]] forces. She returned to Sasebo on 1 June for 11 days of upkeep before heading for Okinawa and two weeks of antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training. On 25 June, ''Taylor'' returned to Japan at Yokosuka, but she departed again almost immediately for duty with the Taiwan Strait Patrol. During that assignment, she visited Hong Kong once again as well as [[Kaohsiung]], where she trained sailors of the [[Republic of China Navy]]. The escort destroyer returned to Yokosuka on 20 July and, after two days of voyage repairs, departed the Far East. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 31 July and, the following day, entered the naval shipyard there for a three-month overhaul.\n\n''Taylor''{{'}}s return to Pearl Harbor coincided very closely with the formal end to hostilities in Korea. The armistice came on 27 July 1953 when she had just passed the midpoint of her voyage\u2014five days out of Yokosuka and four days from Pearl Harbor. While she saw some action during her two [[Korean War]] deployments, they occurred during the relatively quiet, final two years of the conflict. Her subsequent deployments, while they included both duty off Korea and on the Taiwan Strait Patrol, were entirely peaceful in nature until the expansion of the American role in the [[Vietnam]]ese civil war in 1965.\n\n== 1954 &ndash; 1962 ==\n\nIn the five years between 1 March 1954 and 1 March 1959, ''Taylor'' completed five more deployments to the western Pacific. During each, she conducted training exercises and made goodwill visits to Far Eastern ports. When not in the Orient, she conducted normal operations out of Pearl Harbor. During her sixth post-Korean War deployment in 1959 and 1960, she visited Australia for the celebration commemorating the victory at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. Upon her return to Pearl Harbor on 26 May 1960, the escort destroyer conducted normal operations again until December when she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for a major overhaul before deploying to the western Pacific again in August 1961. In lieu of her annual western Pacific deployment, ''Taylor'' spent the spring and summer of 1962 in the mid-Pacific as one of the support units for [[Operation Dominic]], [[nuclear weapon test|nuclear tests]] conducted in the upper atmosphere. In October, she returned to Hawaii to begin a repair period which saw her through the end of 1962. During that year, she reverted to the classification of destroyer and was re-designated '''DD-468''' on 7 August 1962.\n\n== 1962 &ndash; 1965 ==\n\nLocal operations in the Hawaiian Islands occupied the remainder of 1962 and the first six months of 1963. On 4 June 1963, the destroyer stood out of Pearl Harbor with a hunter/killer group bound for duty with the 7th Fleet. During this deployment to the Far East, ''Taylor'' called at [[Kobe]], Japan; Hong Kong; Okinawa; and [[Kushiro, Hokkaido|Kushiro]] as well as the base ports of Yokosuka, Sasebo, and Subic Bay. The call at Kushiro\u2014a fishing port on [[Hokkaid\u014d]], the northernmost of the Japanese home islands\u2014constituted ''Taylor''{{'}}s contributions to the People to People Program and aided in developing greater understanding between the peoples of the United States and Japan. Other than that, the warship engaged in numerous unilateral and bilateral training exercises through the remainder of the cruise which ended at Pearl Harbor on 29 November. ''Taylor'' operated locally in Hawaii until April 1964 when she entered [[drydock]] for a three-month overhaul. In July she resumed operations in Hawaiian waters.\n\nThose operations continued throughout most of the fall of 1964. On 23 November, the destroyer cleared Pearl Harbor in company with [[USS Yorktown (CVS-10)|''Yorktown'']] (CVS-10) and\n[[USS Thomason (DD-746)|''Thomason'']] (DD-746)\nto return to the Orient. The task unit steamed via Midway Atoll and, on 3 December, made port at Yokosuka, Japan. Four days later, she put to sea for two weeks of combined antiaircraft/ antisubmarine warfare exercises conducted with\n[[USS Hancock (CVA-19)|''Hancock'']] (CVA-19) and\n[[USS Strauss (DDG-16)|''Strauss'']] (DDG-16)\nnear Okinawa. On 19 December, the warship returned to Japan at Sasebo and remained there through the holidays and into the New Year.\n\nOn 4 January 1965, ''Taylor'' cleared Sasebo and rejoined ''Yorktown'' and ''Thomason'' for a voyage to Hong Kong. The three ships remained in the [[British Crown Colony]] for five days before clearing port for a series of special operations conducted in the [[Philippine Sea]]. At the conclusion of that duty, she put into Subic Bay on 24 February. After four days in the Philippines, ''Taylor'' headed back to Sasebo, where she arrived on 3 March. Exactly two weeks later, the destroyer got underway for the western portion of the [[South China Sea]]. She arrived off the coast of [[Vietnam]] on 21 March and patrolled there for the following five weeks. On 27 April, ''Taylor'' headed back to Yokosuka for a brief stop\u2014from 3 to 6 May\u2014before returning to Hawaii. The destroyer reentered Pearl Harbor on the 13th and conducted local operations in Hawaiian waters. On 6 December, ''Taylor'' entered the drydock for another overhaul.\n\n== 1965 &ndash; 1967 ==\n\nThe destroyer left the dock in mid-January 1965 and stood out of Pearl Harbor on 7 February and, with the other ships of DesDiv&nbsp;111, shaped a course for the western Pacific. The warship reached Yokosuka 10 days later and spent eight days undergoing voyage repairs. On 25 February, she departed Yokosuka to join Task Group 70.4 off the coast of Vietnam the following day. She patrolled Vietnamese waters until the [[Ides of March]], when she headed north to patrol the Taiwan Strait. During her stay in the area around [[Taiwan]], she visited Kaohsiung. Her relief arrived on 12 April, and ''Taylor'' steamed off to Hong Kong for a five-day port call. On the 21st, she returned to [[Yankee Station]] to resume operations in support of American and [[South Vietnam]]ese forces ashore. Among other tasks, she brought her main battery to bear on the enemy and rendered naval gunfire support between 28 April and 1 May. She conducted upkeep at Sasebo in May and ASW drills from 26 May to 10 June before resuming patrols in the Taiwan Strait on the 11th ( during operation Sand Pan she started to tie up at Da Nang then incoming we quickly pulled away and were request to render gun fire on co-ordnance given one shot hit objective then we sail north for more Sand Pan duty). She cleared the area again on 5 July, rejoined TG&nbsp;70.4 on 7 July, and put into Yokosuka the following day. After a week of preparations, the warship departed Yokosuka to return to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 22 July.\n\nOn 2 August 1965, ''Taylor'' began a tender availability period alongside [[USS Prairie (AD-15)|''Prairie'']] (AD-15) which lasted through the end of the month. Following a short cruise for gunnery practice, ''Taylor'' commenced a restricted availability which lasted until late in November. During the first two weeks in December, the destroyer made a round-trip voyage to [[Pago Pago]], [[American Samoa]]. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 December for holiday leave and upkeep. During the first three months of 1967, the ship conducted local operations around Hawaii, made repairs, and generally prepared to return to the Far East in late spring.\n\nFollowing an Operational Readiness Inspection in mid-April, she cleared Pearl Harbor on the 18th to join the 7th Fleet in the Orient. On 25 April, she changed operational control from the [[U.S. 1st Fleet|1st Fleet]] to the 7th and, three days later, steamed into Yokosuka. During the first half of June, the destroyer participated in exercises with units of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] and ships of the [[Republic of Korea Navy]]. After two days in port at Sasebo, she got underway on 19 June for her first line period on Yankee Station. Between 22 May and 25 June, she plied the waters of the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], plane-guarding for [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|''Hornet'']] (CV-12) and providing gunfire support for Allied forces operating ashore. On 27 June, ''Taylor'' put into Subic Bay. After a tender availability at Subic Bay and a visit to Manila, she put to sea on 10 July to participate in [[SEATO]] exercise \"Sea Dog.\" Between the 26th and the 28th, she visited [[Bang Saen]] on the [[Gulf of Thailand]]. After three more days on Yankee Station\u2014from 28 July to 1 August\u2014   the destroyer made for Taiwan. She reached Kaohsiung on 3 August and remained until 15 August, when she headed back to the coast of Vietnam, Yankee Station sand pan operation. From 19 August to 11 September, she cruised along the Vietnamese coast providing naval gunfire support as needed by the forces operating ashore. She cleared the coast of [[Indochina]] on the 12th, and, after a five-day stop at Hong Kong and another tour of duty in the Gulf of Tonkin, she returned to Yokosuka on 11 October. Five days later, she shaped a course back to Hawaii.\n\n== 1968 &ndash; 1969 ==\n\n''Taylor'' arrived in Pearl Harbor on 23 October, and the destroyer commenced her regular overhaul on 11 December. Repairs and modifications occupied her time through the first three months of 1968. The warship completed overhaul on 22 March and conducted sea trials during the first week in April. Later, engineering problems forced the postponement of further operations until the end of the month. At that time, she began preparations for refresher training. The warship conducted refresher training in May and June, then got underway for [[Naval Station San Diego|San Diego]], [[California|Calif.]], on 27 June. She conducted operations\u2014primarily gunnery drills at [[San Clemente Island]]\u2014from 3 to 11 July. On the latter date, she headed back to Hawaii. En route, ''Taylor'' conducted bombardment exercises at [[Kahoolawe Island]] and then entered Pearl Harbor on the 17th. Three weeks later, the destroyer cleared Pearl Harbor on 5 August and set course for the Gulf of Tonkin.\n\nAfter fueling stops at Midway, [[Guam]], and Subic Bay, she arrived on station off Vietnam on 21 August. ''Taylor'' did plane guard duty for\n[[USS Intrepid (CVS-11)|''Intrepid'']] (CVS-11)\nfor a day; then steamed off with the carrier and destroyers\n[[USS Maddox (DD-731)|''Maddox'']] (DD-731) and\n[[USS Preston (DD-795)|''Preston'']] (DD-795)\ntoward Sasebo. She returned to the Gulf of Tonkin on 5 September and conducted air and surface surveillance as well as antisubmarine warfare exercises in addition to planeguarding for the carriers. On the 19th, the destroyer moved in closer to the coast to provide naval gunfire in support of troops ashore. That duty continued until 6 October when she cleared the combat zone to return to Subic Bay for repairs, supplies, and ammunition. On 20 October, the warship took up where she left off and began a week pounding various targets in Vietnam. That line period was followed by visits to [[Cebu City]] and Subic Bay in the Philippines. During late November and early December, she resumed duty on the gunline. On 4 December, she cleared the combat zone and set a course through the [[Luzon Strait]] to Yokosuka, where she arrived on the 12th. She spent [[Christmas]] in Yokosuka, but returned to Yankee Station by New Year's Day 1969.\n\nIn mid-January, she departed Vietnamese waters for the last time. After stops at Subic Bay; [[Manus Island]]; [[Melbourne]], Australia; [[Auckland]], New Zealand; and Pago Pago, [[Samoa]], the warship arrived back in Pearl Harbor on 28 February. In May, a board of inspection and survey looked her over and determined that she was unfit for further naval service. Early in June, ''Taylor'' was moved to San Diego, California, and was decommissioned on 3 June 1969. Her name was struck from the [[Navy list]] on 2 July 1969, and she was transferred to Italy at the same time. The former American destroyer served in the [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy]] as ''Lanciere'' D 560 until January 1971. She was subsequently cannibalized to maintain her sister ships still serving in the Italian Navy.\n\n==Honors==\n''Taylor'' earned 15 [[battle star]]s during [[World War II]], ranking her among the [[most decorated US ships of World War II]]. In addition, she earned two battle stars for her [[Korean War]] service, and six battle stars for her [[Vietnam War]] service.\n\n==See also==\nSee [[USS Taylor|USS ''Taylor'']] for other ships of the same name.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/t/taylor-ii.html}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|USS Taylor (DD-468)}}\n*[http://usstaylor468.org/ ''Taylor'' Sailors website]\n*[http://destroyerhistory.org/fletcherclass/usstaylor/ USS ''Taylor'' website] at [http://destroyerhistory.org/ Destroyer History Foundation]\n*[http://www.navsource.org/archives/05/468.htm   navsource.org: USS ''Taylor'']\n*[http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/destroy/dd468txt.htm  hazegray.org: USS ''Taylor'']\n <!-- non-breaking space to keep AWB drones from altering the space before the navbox-->\n\n{{Fletcher class destroyer|others}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2013}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taylor (Dd-468)}}\n[[Category:Fletcher-class destroyers of the United States Navy]]\n[[Category:Ships built in Bath, Maine]]\n[[Category:1942 ships]]\n[[Category:World War II destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Korean War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War destroyers of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Navy Rhode Island-related ships]]\n[[Category:Fante-class destroyers]]\n", "name_user": "Patapsco913", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAug. \u2013 Sept. 1943", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Taylor_(DD-468)"}

One of the most important of those breeders is Mrs. Sylvia Roriz de Carvalho, a well-known veterinarian, painter and cat breeder, whose Cattery Syarte has been breeding the Brazilian Shorthair for more than a decade.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Several other breeders followed in her footsteps.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Now, in all WCF Cat Shows in Brazil, one can see Brazilian Shorthairs whose lineage traces back to several generations - not from feral cats anymore - competing side by side  with other well-known breeds. The Brazilian Shorthair has been shown and cited by several magazines in many parts of the world, such as Japan, Germany, England, Australia, and the US.\n\nDespite this worldwide success,{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} there are still very few Brazilian Shorthair [[Selective breeding|breeders]] in its native country. The breeding of random street cats has been met with much opposition among animal rights activists and professional cat breeders.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://petslady.com/articles/one_brazilian_jeangray_our_neighborhood_brazilian_shorthair_cat_63784 One In A Brazilian: Jean Grey, Our Neighborhood Brazilian Shorthair Cat]\n\n{{Cat nav}}\n\n[[Category:Cat breeds]]\n[[Category:Cat breeds originating in Brazil]]\n", "name_user": "178.141.120.170", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTemperament:go sex suka- tell every day cat)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Shorthair"}

Their catalogue is generally based around simple chord progressions, often performed with a speed and tonal aggression that was novel for the time, making the band a notable influence on later [[punk rock]] bands.\n\n==Biography==\n===1960s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe Sonics were formed in 1960 in Tacoma, Washington by teen-aged guitarist Larry Parypa, with the encouragement of his music-loving parents. The earliest lineup included Parypa, drummer Mitch Jaber, and guitarist Stuart Turner; Parypa's brother Jerry briefly played saxophone, and their mother occasionally filled in on bass at rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-sonics-mn0000428717 |title=The Sonics &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> In 1961, Parypa's older brother Andy became the bass player, and Tony Mabin took over as their new saxophone player.\n\nWhen Turner left for the army, Rich Koch (who had previously played with the Wailers) joined as lead guitarist, and Marilyn Lodge became their first singer, the band having been an instrumental combo up to that point. A new drummer, Bill Dean, replaced Jaber.\n\nKoch and Lodge left the band in 1963. Local star Ray Michelsen became the band's singer after having sung with several other popular bands on the local scene. Larry began looking for a drummer to replace Dean, who he felt was uncommitted to the band, and found Bob Bennett playing in a band called the Searchers, with keyboardist Gerry Roslie and sax player Rob Lind. Ray Michelsen was looking to leave the band, so the Parypas hired Bennett, Roslie, and Lind, and let their previous saxophonist Mabin go. The well-known lineup was in place, but the Sonics' career did not begin in earnest until 1964, when Gerry Roslie started singing lead vocals. With Roslie as lead singer, the band started playing gigs at local venues such as the Red Carpet, Olympia's Skateland, the Evergreen Ballroom, Perl's (Bremerton), the Spanish Castle Ballroom, and St. Mary's Parish Hall.\n\nThey soon were scouted by Buck Ormsby, bassist for popular Northwest band the Wailers, and signed to Etiquette Records, the Wailers' own record label. Their first single was \"The Witch\" (with [[Little Richard]]'s \"Keep a-Knockin'\" as the [[B-side]]) in November 1964. The record was immensely popular with local kids, and went on to become the biggest selling local single in the history of the Northwest despite its radio airplay being restricted because of its bizarre subject matter.\n\nEarly in 1965 Etiquette released the Sonics' debut [[Vinyl record|LP]], ''Here Are The Sonics'', which was produced at Audio Recording in Seattle, Washington with famed Pacific Northwest recording engineer [[Kearney Barton]]. It was recorded on a two-track tape recorder, with only one microphone to pick up the entire drum kit. It was here that they began to pioneer some of their infamously reckless recording techniques. A second album, ''Boom'', followed in February 1966. During the recording, the Sonics ripped the soundproofing off the walls at the [[country and western]]-oriented Wiley/Griffith studio in Tacoma to \"get a live-er sound.\" The covers of both albums feature the moody photography of [[Jini Dellaccio]].\n\nTheir heyday began to come to a close when the band transferred to [[Jerden Records]] in late 1966, and headed to Hollywood to record the poorly selling album ''Introducing the Sonics'' with Larry Levine at Gold Star Studios. Although it has been rumoured that Jerden executives pushed the Sonics into a more polished sound, the band itself had decided to follow new influences in modern music, resulting in songs that were quite different from their raucously early recordings. The band, however, was not satisfied with the material on ''Introducing the Sonics'', calling the cleaner, slicker recordings \"the worst garbage.\"\n\nThe original band fell apart between 1966 and 1968, with members leaving to attend university or join other bands; saxophonist Rob Lind became a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War. Eventually, all of the original members left, with new members continuing on with the name Sonics (later 'Jim Brady and the Sonics') until 1980,<ref>{{cite web|author=Darryl Riffero, Bill Majkut, Danny Hoefer, Dean Quackenbush, Steve Tuba, Dave Talbott, Jim Sailors, Marty Woodard, Scott Batchelder, Colin Weinmaster, Rick |url=http://pnwbands.com/sonicsbrady.html |title=Jim Brady & The Sonics - Seattle, WA (1967-1980) |publisher=Pnwbands.com |date=2013-02-17 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> although it was a completely different band, at times even incorporating string and horn sections.\n\n===Reformations===\nThe original Sonics reunited briefly in 1972 for a live show at Seattle's Paramount Theater, with the recording of this show released as ''Live Fanz Only'' by Etiquette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesonicsboom.com/discography/live/ |title=Live &#124; |website=Thesonicsboom.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}</ref> In 1980, a new Sonics fronted by Gerry Roslie recorded the album ''Sinderella'', which featured versions of the original band's material.\n\nThe emergence of punk rock in the late '70s and grunge in the '90s led to new interest in the Sonics, and much of their material was re-released by labels in the US and Europe. Larry and Andy Parypa continued performing with various bands in the Northwest, while Roslie, Lind, and Bennett pursued careers outside of music.\n\nA further surge of interest in the Sonics was sparked by the use of their hard-rocking version of [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]'s \"[[Have Love, Will Travel]]\" in a 2004 Land Rover TV ad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmusic.com/music/cd/616909/sonics-have-love-will-travel |title=Sonics: Have Love Will Travel: CD Music Details: CCMusic.com 029667000307 |publisher=Ccmusic.com |date=2004-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410164603/http://www.ccmusic.com/music/cd/616909/sonics-have-love-will-travel |archivedate=2013-04-10 }}</ref>\n\nTheir music was further impressed upon younger generations through a movement known as [[The Beat Army]], an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]].\n\nIn 2007, the Sonics reunited again, this time for the Cavestomp garage rock festival in Brooklyn (November 2\u20134, 2007). The line up featured original members Gerry Roslie on vocals and keyboards, Larry Parypa on guitar, and Rob Lind on tenor sax, with Ricky Lynn Johnson (of the Wailers) on drums and Don Wilhelm (of the [[Daily Flash]]) on bass and vocals.\n\nIn 2008, the Sonics recorded a live session for [[Mark Lamarr]]'s [[BBC Radio 2]] show ''God's Jukebox'' on March 22. They played their first ever shows in London on Friday March 21 and Sunday March 23; later that year, \"Have Love, Will Travel\" was prominently featured on the soundtrack of [[Guy Ritchie]]'s hit film ''[[RocknRolla]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd|title=RocknRolla (2008) Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\nSince then, they have played the Primavera Festival in Barcelona, followed by Bilbao, then the [[Sjock Festival]] in Belgium, Norway, and the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria in the Basque Country.\n\nTheir first show in their home region since their last Seattle reunion in 1972 was on [[Halloween]] 31 October 2008 at the [[Paramount Theater (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount Theatre]] in Seattle, where they were introduced and joined onstage for several songs by [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Kent Morrill (front man of the Wailers) made a surprise appearance to help sing his signature song \"Dirty Robber\".  Bob Bennett was also present to sit in on drums albeit only for a few songs and only while Ricky Lynn Johnson played in unison.\n\nIn 2009 Freddie Dennis, formerly of Freddie and the Screamers, the Kingsmen, and the Liverpool 5, took Wilhelm's place as bassist and vocalist. The following year they released ''8'', an EP featuring both live cuts and four new songs produced by Larry Parypa and [[Jack Endino]] at Sound House Recording in Seattle. For the recording Andy Parypa came back on bass.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jasmin |first=Ernest |url=http://www.tacomaweekly.com/citylife/view/make-a-scene-the-sonics-soundgarden-finally-come-back-to-their-fans/ |title=Tacoma Weekly |publisher=Tacoma Weekly |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112826/http://www.tacomaweekly.com/citylife/view/make-a-scene-the-sonics-soundgarden-finally-come-back-to-their-fans/ |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Johnson was replaced by drummer [[Dusty Watson]], who has played with Slacktone, Agent Orange, Dick Dale, the Surfaris, Davie Allan and the Arrows, Lita Ford, the Supersuckers, The Boss Martians, Fur Dixon and others.\n\nThe Sonics headlined the fifth annual [[Muddy Roots]] Music Festival over Labor Day weekend in 2014. That same year, Muddy Roots Recordings published the previously unreleased song, \"Bad Betty,\" on a 7\" record (split with Mudhoney) for Record Store Day.\n\nOn January 21, 2015 the band announced they would be releasing a new album, their first in over 40 years, entitled ''[[This Is The Sonics]]''. The album was released via their own imprint, Revox on March 31.  The band also announced a tour to support the new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2015/04/09/garage-band-legends-sonics-roar-back-life/XCLllM2hxOPYuG1I0jomRL/story.html |title=Garage-band legends the Sonics roar back to life |publisher=BostonGlobe.com |date=2015-04-09 |accessdate=2015-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOn May 2, 2016 an announcement was posted by Rob Lind on the band's Facebook site that Gerry Roslie and Larry Parypa would no longer be continuing as touring members of the band although they will still be involved in recording and Larry will occasionally be playing live with the band. Their positions are being filled on a touring basis by Jake Cavaliere of the [[Lords of Altamont]] on keyboards and Evan Foster of the Boss Martians on guitar.\n\n==Influence==\nThe Sonics are often-cited contenders for the title of \"the first punk band,\" due to their wild and ground-breaking style. The band also have a clearly marked influence on American punk bands such as [[the Cramps]] and [[the Dead Boys]] in their brash, menacing style and attitude, and on 1980s [[grunge]] bands (who originated in the same area), especially [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]], who adopted some of the darker themes from Sonics music, and a lot of their techniques on over-driving and distorting electric guitars. Their reach stretched beyond the U.S.; influential [[Manchester]] post-punk group [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] covered \"Strychnine\" during a session for the late [[John Peel]]'s programme in 1993 and they repeatedly performed the song live around this time. As well as all these, there have been whole generations of garage rock revival bands (such as The Thingz) who make no bones of plagiarizing The Sonics and their ilk.

Their catalogue is generally based around simple chord progressions, often performed with a speed and tonal aggression that was novel for the time, making the band a notable influence on later [[punk rock]] bands.\n\n==Biography==\n===1960s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nThe Sonics were formed in 1960 in Tacoma, Washington by teen-aged guitarist Larry Parypa, with the encouragement of his music-loving parents. The earliest lineup included Parypa, drummer Mitch Jaber, and guitarist Stuart Turner; Parypa's brother Jerry briefly played saxophone, and their mother occasionally filled in on bass at rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-sonics-mn0000428717 |title=The Sonics &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> In 1961, Parypa's older brother Andy became the bass player, and Tony Mabin took over as their new saxophone player.\n\nWhen Turner left for the army, Rich Koch (who had previously played with the Wailers) joined as lead guitarist, and Marilyn Lodge became their first singer, the band having been an instrumental combo up to that point. A new drummer, Bill Dean, replaced Jaber.\n\nKoch and Lodge left the band in 1963. Local star Ray Michelsen became the band's singer after having sung with several other popular bands on the local scene. Larry began looking for a drummer to replace Dean, who he felt was uncommitted to the band, and found Bob Bennett playing in a band called the Searchers, with keyboardist Gerry Roslie and sax player Rob Lind. Ray Michelsen was looking to leave the band, so the Parypas hired Bennett, Roslie, and Lind, and let their previous saxophonist Mabin go. The well-known lineup was in place, but the Sonics' career did not begin in earnest until 1964, when Gerry Roslie started singing lead vocals. With Roslie as lead singer, the band started playing gigs at local venues such as the Red Carpet, Olympia's Skateland, the Evergreen Ballroom, Perl's (Bremerton), the Spanish Castle Ballroom, and St. Mary's Parish Hall.\n\nThey soon were scouted by Buck Ormsby, bassist for popular Northwest band the Wailers, and signed to Etiquette Records, the Wailers' own record label. Their first single was \"The Witch\" (with [[Little Richard]]'s \"Keep a-Knockin'\" as the [[B-side]]) in November 1964. The record was immensely popular with local kids, and went on to become the biggest selling local single in the history of the Northwest despite its radio airplay being restricted because of its bizarre subject matter.\n\nEarly in 1965 Etiquette released the Sonics' debut [[Vinyl record|LP]], ''Here Are The Sonics'', which was produced at Audio Recording in Seattle, Washington with famed Pacific Northwest recording engineer [[Kearney Barton]]. It was recorded on a two-track tape recorder, with only one microphone to pick up the entire drum kit. It was here that they began to pioneer some of their infamously reckless recording techniques. A second album, ''Boom'', followed in February 1966. During the recording, the Sonics ripped the soundproofing off the walls at the [[country and western]]-oriented Wiley/Griffith studio in Tacoma to \"get a live-er sound.\" The covers of both albums feature the moody photography of [[Jini Dellaccio]].\n\nTheir heyday began to come to a close when the band transferred to [[Jerden Records]] in late 1966, and headed to Hollywood to record the poorly selling album ''Introducing the Sonics'' with Larry Levine at Gold Star Studios. Although it has been rumoured that Jerden executives pushed the Sonics into a more polished sound, the band itself had decided to follow new influences in modern music, resulting in songs that were quite different from their raucously early recordings. The band, however, was not satisfied with the material on ''Introducing the Sonics'', calling the cleaner, slicker recordings \"the worst garbage.\"\n\nThe original band fell apart between 1966 and 1968, with members leaving to attend university or join other bands; saxophonist Rob Lind became a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War. Eventually, all of the original members left, with new members continuing on with the name Sonics (later 'Jim Brady and the Sonics') until 1980,<ref>{{cite web|author=Darryl Riffero, Bill Majkut, Danny Hoefer, Dean Quackenbush, Steve Tuba, Dave Talbott, Jim Sailors, Marty Woodard, Scott Batchelder, Colin Weinmaster, Rick |url=http://pnwbands.com/sonicsbrady.html |title=Jim Brady & The Sonics - Seattle, WA (1967-1980) |publisher=Pnwbands.com |date=2013-02-17 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref> although it was a completely different band, at times even incorporating string and horn sections.\n\n===Reformations===\nThe original Sonics reunited briefly in 1972 for a live show at Seattle's Paramount Theater, with the recording of this show released as ''Live Fanz Only'' by Etiquette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesonicsboom.com/discography/live/ |title=Live &#124; |website=Thesonicsboom.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}</ref> In 1980, a new Sonics fronted by Gerry Roslie recorded the album ''Sinderella'', which featured versions of the original band's material.\n\nThe emergence of punk rock in the late '70s and grunge in the '90s led to new interest in the Sonics, and much of their material was re-released by labels in the US and Europe. Larry and Andy Parypa continued performing with various bands in the Northwest, while Roslie, Lind, and Bennett pursued careers outside of music.\n\nA further surge of interest in the Sonics was sparked by the use of their hard-rocking version of [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]]'s \"[[Have Love, Will Travel]]\" in a 2004 Land Rover TV ad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmusic.com/music/cd/616909/sonics-have-love-will-travel |title=Sonics: Have Love Will Travel: CD Music Details: CCMusic.com 029667000307 |publisher=Ccmusic.com |date=2004-11-30 |accessdate=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130410164603/http://www.ccmusic.com/music/cd/616909/sonics-have-love-will-travel |archivedate=2013-04-10 }}</ref>\n\nTheir music was further impressed upon younger generations through a movement known as [[The Beat Army]], an online music forum based on Facebook which is operated by author and music producer [[Paul Collins (musician)|Paul Collins]].\n\nIn 2007, the Sonics reunited again, this time for the Cavestomp garage rock festival in Brooklyn (November 2\u20134, 2007). The line up featured original members Gerry Roslie on vocals and keyboards, Larry Parypa on guitar, and Rob Lind on tenor sax, with Ricky Lynn Johnson (of the Wailers) on drums and Don Wilhelm (of the [[Daily Flash]]) on bass and vocals.\n\nIn 2008, the Sonics recorded a live session for [[Mark Lamarr]]'s [[BBC Radio 2]] show ''God's Jukebox'' on March 22. They played their first ever shows in London on Friday March 21 and Sunday March 23; later that year, \"Have Love, Will Travel\" was prominently featured on the soundtrack of [[Guy Ritchie]]'s hit film ''[[RocknRolla]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1032755/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd|title=RocknRolla (2008) Soundtracks|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\nSince then, they have played the Primavera Festival in Barcelona, followed by Bilbao, then the [[Sjock Festival]] in Belgium, Norway, and the Azkena Rock Festival in Vitoria in the Basque Country.\n\nTheir first show in their home region since their last Seattle reunion in 1972 was on [[Halloween]] 31 October 2008 at the [[Paramount Theater (Seattle, Washington)|Paramount Theatre]] in Seattle, where they were introduced and joined onstage for several songs by [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Kent Morrill (front man of the Wailers) made a surprise appearance to help sing his signature song \"Dirty Robber\".  Bob Bennett was also present to sit in on drums albeit only for a few songs and only while Ricky Lynn Johnson played in unison.\n\nIn 2009 Freddie Dennis, formerly of Freddie and the Screamers, the Kingsmen, and the Liverpool 5, took Wilhelm's place as bassist and vocalist. The following year they released ''8'', an EP featuring both live cuts and four new songs produced by Larry Parypa and [[Jack Endino]] at Sound House Recording in Seattle. For the recording Andy Parypa came back on bass.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jasmin |first=Ernest |url=http://www.tacomaweekly.com/citylife/view/make-a-scene-the-sonics-soundgarden-finally-come-back-to-their-fans/ |title=Tacoma Weekly |publisher=Tacoma Weekly |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2014-08-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112826/http://www.tacomaweekly.com/citylife/view/make-a-scene-the-sonics-soundgarden-finally-come-back-to-their-fans/ |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Johnson was replaced by drummer [[Dusty Watson]], who has played with Slacktone, Agent Orange, Dick Dale, the Surfaris, Davie Allan and the Arrows, Lita Ford, the Supersuckers, The Boss Martians, Fur Dixon and others.\n\nThe Sonics headlined the fifth annual [[Muddy Roots]] Music Festival over Labor Day weekend in 2014. That same year, Muddy Roots Recordings published the previously unreleased song, \"Bad Betty,\" on a 7\" record (split with Mudhoney) for Record Store Day.\n\nOn January 21, 2015 the band announced they would be releasing a new album, their first in over 40 years, entitled ''[[This Is The Sonics]]''. The album was released via their own imprint, Revox on March 31.

Their positions are being filled on a touring basis by Jake Cavaliere of the [[Lords of Altamont]] on keyboards and Evan Foster of the Boss Martians on guitar.\n\n==Influence==\nThe Sonics are often-cited contenders for the title of \"the first punk band,\" due to their wild and ground-breaking style. The band also have a clearly marked influence on American punk bands such as [[the Cramps]] and [[the Dead Boys]] in their brash, menacing style and attitude, and on 1980s [[grunge]] bands (who originated in the same area), especially [[Mudhoney (band)|Mudhoney]], who adopted some of the darker themes from Sonics music, and a lot of their techniques on over-driving and distorting electric guitars. Their reach stretched beyond the U.S.; influential [[Manchester]] post-punk group [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] covered \"Strychnine\" during a session for the late [[John Peel]]'s programme in 1993 and they repeatedly performed the song live around this time. As well as all these, there have been whole generations of garage rock revival bands (such as The Thingz) who make no bones of plagiarizing The Sonics and their ilk. The early 21st century saw the arrival of another garage rock band that lists the Sonics as a major influence, [[Eagles of Death Metal]]. New Zealand power-punk band [[Cut Off Your Hands]] have covered \"The Witch\" several times in concert.\n\n[[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] said in an interview with [[Nardwuar the Human Serviette]] on [[CITR-FM]], discussing drum sounds,''\"I, I have to admit...
