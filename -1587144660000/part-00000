Written between 600BC-200AD, these poems are appreciated for their poetic value, vision, metaphors and technique.

SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system.

The original premise by [[Gene Roddenberry]] dated March 1964 describes a starship USS ''Yorktown''. As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Nonetheless, one of Art Director [[Matt Jefferies]]' original drawings depicts the Starship ''Enterprise'' with ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) for scale.<ref>Whitfield, Stephen and Roddenberry, Gene (1968).

Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''.

SCANFAR was intended to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. SCANFAR consisted of two radars, the AN/SPS-32 and the AN/SPS-33. The AN/SPS-32 was a long-range air search and target acquisition radar developed by Hughes for the U.S. Navy. The AN/SPS-32 operated together with the AN/SPS-33, which was the square array used for 3D tracking, into one system. It was installed on only two vessels, ''Enterprise'' and the cruiser {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|6}}, placing a massive power drain on the ship's electric system.{{Citation_needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe technology of the AN/SPS-32 was based on vacuum tubes and the system required constant repairs. The SPS-32 was a phased array radar which had a range of 400 nautical miles against large targets, and 200 nautical miles against small, fighter-size targets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Thor|url=http://science-naturalphenomena.blogspot.com/2011/01/ansps-32.html |title=Science, Natural Phenomena & Medicine: AN/SPS-32 |publisher=Science-naturalphenomena.blogspot.com |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> These early phased arrays, replaced around 1980, were responsible for the distinctive square-looking island.<ref name=\"janes2000-p798\">{{cite book | title = Jane's Fighting Ships 2000\u20132001 | editor = Capt Richard Sharpe OBE RN | year = 2000 | publisher = Jane's Information Group | location = Coulsdon, Surrey, UK | page = 798 | isbn = 0-7106-2018-7}}</ref>\n\nThe AN/SPS-32 and AN/SPS-33 radars, while ahead of their time, suffered from issues relating to electrical beam steering mechanism and were not pursued in further ship classes. While they are considered to be an early form of \"phased array\" radar, it would take the later technology of the Aegis phased array AN/SPY-1 with its electronically controlled beam steering to make phased array radars both reliable and practical for the USN.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The dome above the SCANFAR contained the unique electronic warfare suite, the Andrew Alford AA-8200 dipole antennas (which never acquired a military designation). The system consisted of six rows of antennae encircling the dome. The antennae in the upper two rows were encased in piping radomes as they were small and fragile.  \n\n==History==\n[[File:USS Enterprise (CVAN-65) christening at Neport News SB 1960.jpg|thumb|left|''Enterprise'' is christened at Newport News shipyard in 1960.]]\n\n===Commissioning and trials===\n[[File:330-PSA-224-60 (USN 710802) (21305680371).jpg|thumb|left| Christening at Newport News shipyard in 1960.]]\nIn 1958, ''Enterprise''{{'}}s keel was laid at [[Newport News Shipbuilding|Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] in Shipway 11.

[[Henry Fonda]] played the role of Frank Beardsley, a U.S. Navy warrant officer attached to the ship.\n\n''Enterprise'' was a principal setting of the popular movie ''[[Top Gun]]'' released in 1986. Director [[Tony Scott]] filmed actual flight operations aboard ship and incorporated them into the film's plot. Some interior scenes taking place aboard ''Enterprise'' were actually filmed on {{USS|Ranger|CV-61}}.\n\nIn 1986, ''Enterprise'' was a setting of scenes in ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]''. The ship was unavailable for filming, so scenes depicting ''Enterprise'' were again filmed aboard USS ''[[USS Ranger (CV-61)|Ranger]]''.<ref>Okuda, Denise & Michael (1999). ''The Star Trek Encyclopedia'', p. 90. New York: Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-53609-5}}.</ref> More important for ''[[Star Trek]]'' lore, the first nuclear aircraft carrier was in position to inspire naming of Starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701}}. The original premise by [[Gene Roddenberry]] dated March 1964 describes a starship USS ''Yorktown''. As USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) was then one of the newest and most celebrated ships of the US Navy, occupying a similar status as the fictional Starship ''Enterprise'', the aircraft carrier may have inspired a name change, though Roddenberry himself had already dispelled that notion in a 1973 radio interview, reaffirming that he had named his fictional starship after its illustrious World War 2 namesake.<ref>Scott Arthur's interview with Gene Roddenberry (1973) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k77gMo8ifh4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/oral-history-star-trek-180958779/|title=An Oral History of \"Star Trek\"|last=Gross|first=Edward|last2=Altman|first2=Mark A.|year=2016|website=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-01-28}}</ref> Nonetheless, one of Art Director [[Matt Jefferies]]' original drawings depicts the Starship ''Enterprise'' with ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65) for scale.<ref>Whitfield, Stephen and Roddenberry, Gene (1968). ''The Making of Star Trek'', p. 167. New York, Ballantine Books. {{ISBN|978-0-345-24691-2}}.</ref> Many of the subsequent ''Star Trek'' television shows and movies have been set aboard a ship named ''Enterprise'', and the starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701-D|6}} of the show ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' has a relief of five Enterprise starship models and a model of CVN-65 on the wall of its observation lounge. Futhermore, in the subsequent prequel series ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', a quartet of portraits depicting vessels named ''Enterprise'' adorns the wall of Captain [[Jonathan Archer]]'s ready room, the second of which is the CVN-65. A similar display is seen on the recreation deck of the ''Enterprise'' in ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]''. The [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'' (OV-101)]], originally slated to be named ''Constitution'', was renamed after the Starship ''Enterprise'' following a write-in campaign to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]]. In 1995, ''Enterprise'' (covered as the USS ''Seahawk'') was also used to film scenes for the pilot episodes of the TV series \"[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aerial warfare]]\n* [[Air supremacy]]\n* [[Carrier strike group]]\n* [[Carrier battle group]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers]]\n* [[List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy]]\n*[[List of ships of the United States Navy named Enterprise|List of ships of the United States Navy named ''Enterprise'']]\n* [[Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov]]\n* [[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n* [[Carrier Strike Group Twelve]]\n* [[List of world's longest ships]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{Citation | last = Cracknell | first = W.
