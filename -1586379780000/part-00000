A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] he served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] from 1995 to 1997, and was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] to [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]].\n\n''The [[Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2009 exposed Hogg for claiming upwards of \u00a32,000 of taxpayers' money so-called for the purposes of \"cleaning the [[moat]]\" of his country estate, [[Kettlethorpe Hall]]; thus he became one of the most prominent illustrations used by the media to portray the extent of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|parliamentary expenses scandal]], although it later emerged that Hogg had been encouraged by the House of Commons Fees Office ([[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]]'s precursor) to submit equivalent ''en bloc'' expenses \"so as to reduce admin\". As a result of the negative publicity, Hogg did not seek re-election at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nAside from his hereditary peerage, he was made a [[life peer]] in the 2015 Dissolution Honours allowing him a seat in the [[House of Lords]].

He became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1990, a year after his younger sister, [[Mary Hogg|Dame Mary Hogg]], a barrister later appointed [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|Justice]] of the [[Family Division]].\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n[[The Hon.]] Douglas Hogg was elected as a Member of Parliament at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] for the [[Lincolnshire]] seat of [[Grantham (UK Parliament constituency)|Grantham]], following the retirement of the sitting Conservative MP [[Joseph Bradshaw Godber|Joseph Godber]].\n\nThe Grantham seat was abolished at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]; however, Hogg stood and was returned as MP for [[Sleaford and North Hykeham (UK Parliament constituency)|Sleaford and North Hykeham]] in 1997.\n\n===In Government===\nIn [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], Hogg served as a member of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] from 1979, until his appointment as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to the [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Leon Brittan]] in 1982.\n\nHogg became a junior member of the Government of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] following the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], when he served as a [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] for a year. He rejoined HM Government in 1986 when he was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Home Office]], and was promoted in 1989 to [[Minister of State]] at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].\n\nHogg was moved in 1990 under the leadership of Prime Minister [[John Major]] to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], becoming a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1992.

The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peers]] to a seat in the [[House of Lords]], so when his father died in 2001 (being [[heir apparent]] to the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]]), he was not required (as would previously have been the case) to resign from the House of Commons and remained an [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] until retiring in 2010.\n\n===Stevens Enquiry===\nIn the report of his [[Stevens Inquiries|enquiry]] concerning collusion in Northern Ireland between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, under \"Other Matters concerning Collusion\", a section of [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Sir John Stevens]]' report reads:\n\n:\"2.17  My Enquiry team also investigated an allegation that senior [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] officers briefed the [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], the Rt Hon Douglas Hogg QC MP, that \u2018some solicitors were unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA\u2019.

I never claimed for these and I never received any money.  \"The work to the stables that ''The Telegraph'' mentioned was actually for maintenance of security lights which were installed by the Home Office as part of the response to an IRA threat.\" He said he had issued, in the interests of full transparency, full lists of all his expenditure on the property but these were never meant to be the record of a claim. Mr Hogg said it was clear to the Fees Office that the overall allowable expenses were over the Additional Costs Allowance and that his claim only covered utilities, council tax, building insurance, the alarm system, heating, repairs and maintenance of house and garden and 65% of the cost of a housekeeper to clean and maintain the house and look after it when he and his wife, Baroness Hogg, were away. He said: \"It was on this basis and with the express agreement of the Fees Office, in advance and in writing that I was making a monthly claim equal to one-twelfth of the ACA.\" Mr Hogg added: \"I am amongst the lowest claimers in Parliament \u2013 specifically 551st out of 645 MPs in 2007/8. \"There is no doubt that our system has lost public confidence and we as parliamentarians have got to accept that we are responsible for having put the system in place and that it is probably flawed. \"We got it wrong and need to apologise for that, and I do apologise for it.\"}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May, Hogg agreed to repay the \u00a32,200 cost of clearing the moat, after an order from the party leadership.

Kingdom|British]] [[politician]] and [[barrister]]. A member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] he served in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as [[Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] from 1995 to 1997, and was a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) from [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]] to [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]].\n\n''The [[Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2009 exposed Hogg for claiming upwards of \u00a32,000 of taxpayers' money so-called for the purposes of \"cleaning the [[moat]]\" of his country estate, [[Kettlethorpe Hall]]; thus he became one of the most prominent illustrations used by the media to portray the extent of the [[United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal|parliamentary expenses scandal]], although it later emerged that Hogg had been encouraged by the House of Commons Fees Office ([[Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority]]'s precursor) to submit equivalent ''en bloc'' expenses \"so as to reduce admin\". As a result of the negative publicity, Hogg did not seek re-election at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]].\n\nAside from his hereditary peerage, he was made a [[life peer]] in the 2015 Dissolution Honours allowing him a seat in the [[House of Lords]].

He became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1990, a year after his younger sister, [[Mary Hogg|Dame Mary Hogg]], a barrister later appointed [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|Justice]] of the [[Family Division]].\n\n==Member of Parliament==\n[[The Hon.]] Douglas Hogg was elected as a Member of Parliament at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] for the [[Lincolnshire]] seat of [[Grantham (UK Parliament constituency)|Grantham]], following the retirement of the sitting Conservative MP [[Joseph Bradshaw Godber|Joseph Godber]].\n\nThe Grantham seat was abolished at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]]; however, Hogg stood and was returned as MP for [[Sleaford and North Hykeham (UK Parliament constituency)|Sleaford and North Hykeham]] in 1997.\n\n===In Government===\nIn [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], Hogg served as a member of the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]] [[Select committee (United Kingdom)|Select committee]] from 1979, until his appointment as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to the [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Leon Brittan]] in 1982.\n\nHogg became a junior member of the Government of [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] following the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], when he served as a [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] for a year. He rejoined HM Government in 1986 when he was appointed as a [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] at the [[Home Office]], and was promoted in 1989 to [[Minister of State]] at the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]].\n\nHogg was moved in 1990 under the leadership of Prime Minister [[John Major]] to the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], becoming a member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] in 1992.

The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of [[hereditary peers]] to a seat in the [[House of Lords]], so when his father died in 2001 (being [[heir apparent]] to the [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peerage]]), he was not required (as would previously have been the case) to resign from the House of Commons and remained an [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]] until retiring in 2010.\n\n===Stevens Enquiry===\nIn the report of his [[Stevens Inquiries|enquiry]] concerning collusion in Northern Ireland between loyalist paramilitaries and the security forces, under \"Other Matters concerning Collusion\", a section of [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Sir John Stevens]]' report reads:\n\n:\"2.17  My Enquiry team also investigated an allegation that senior [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] officers briefed the [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], the Rt Hon Douglas Hogg QC MP, that \u2018some solicitors were unduly sympathetic to the cause of the IRA\u2019.

I never claimed for these and I never received any money.  \"The work to the stables that ''The Telegraph'' mentioned was actually for maintenance of security lights which were installed by the Home Office as part of the response to an IRA threat.\" He said he had issued, in the interests of full transparency, full lists of all his expenditure on the property but these were never meant to be the record of a claim. Mr Hogg said it was clear to the Fees Office that the overall allowable expenses were over the Additional Costs Allowance and that his claim only covered utilities, council tax, building insurance, the alarm system, heating, repairs and maintenance of house and garden and 65% of the cost of a housekeeper to clean and maintain the house and look after it when he and his wife, Baroness Hogg, were away. He said: \"It was on this basis and with the express agreement of the Fees Office, in advance and in writing that I was making a monthly claim equal to one-twelfth of the ACA.\" Mr Hogg added: \"I am amongst the lowest claimers in Parliament \u2013 specifically 551st out of 645 MPs in 2007/8. \"There is no doubt that our system has lost public confidence and we as parliamentarians have got to accept that we are responsible for having put the system in place and that it is probably flawed. \"We got it wrong and need to apologise for that, and I do apologise for it.\"}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 May, Hogg agreed to repay the \u00a32,200 cost of clearing the moat, after an order from the party leadership.

In 1900-1905 he was publishing in [[Vienna]] a neo-Slavophillic magazine \"Slavianskiy vek\". The [[neo-Slavism]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] were sponsored by Russian aristocracy, particularly Count [[Vladimir Bobrinskiy]] who was financing the magazine \"Slavianskiy vek\". Vergun also was a member of [[Galician-Russian Charitable Society]] (1902-1914) that was financed by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn 1918-1919 Vergun was teaching Slavic philology in [[Moscow University]] and [[Irkutsk University]].\n\nAlong with Pyotr Gatalak and Dmitriy Markov promoted the idea of Carpathian Russians.\n\nDue to the [[Russian Civil War]], 1922-1945 he was teaching Russian language and Slavic Studies in the Prague Higher School. Since 1945 Vergun was a professor at the [[Houston University]].\n\nHe died in [[Houston]] in 1951.\n\n==Works==\n===Poetry===\n* Red Russian echoes (Lemberg, 1901, 1907);\n* Carpathian echoes (1920);\n\nAmong his poems used to be successful his \"Slavic bells\" ({{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0421\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0432\u043e\u043d\u044b\u00bb}}).

Feminist institutionalism focuses on how institutions are gendered and how their formal and informal rules play a part in shaping political life.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Meryl|year=2014|title=A Feminist Institutionalist Approach|url=|journal=Government and Opposition|volume=10|issue=4|pages=679\u2013684|doi=10.1017/s1743923x14000488}}</ref> It offers a new way of interpreting the formation of institutions that goes beyond traditional views by accounting for the gendered stigma and gendered outcomes that comes with institutions. As a result, feminist institutionalism is changing the face of various institutions by providing awareness into their very own dynamics of inclusion and exclusion.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Fiona|last2=Chappell|first2=Louise|author-link2=Louise Chappell|year=2010|title=New Institutionalism Through a Gender Lens: Towards a Feminist Institutionalism?|url=http://journals1.scholarsportal.info.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/details/01925121/v31i0005/573_nitagltafi.xml|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=31|issue=5|pages=573\u2013588|via=|doi=10.1177/0192512110388788}}</ref>\n\nFeminist institutionalism touches upon all areas involved in the construction of institutions and has a direct effect on things such as policies, legislations, laws and/or quotas, and many more. Gender plays an important role in this process by impacting both power relations and social interactions, because it is through the understanding of gender that individuals classify and rate masculinity and femininity throughout various institutions. This form of new institutionalism plays an active role from within, seeking to alter the ways in which it operates and how it is institutionally framed by having an influence on its policies and outcomes.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Waylen|first=Georgina|authorlink=Georgina Waylen|year=2007|title=Engendering Transitions : Womens Mobilizations, Institutions, and Gender Outcomes|url=https://archive.org/details/engenderingtrans0000wayl|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199248032.001.0001|isbn=9780199248032|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nA feminist perspective aims to help with understanding the framework that starts to shape between gendered institutional subjects and the environment,<ref name=\":0\" /> and also aims to provide an insight on how institutions can be re-gendered.\n\n== History ==\nNew institutionalism began to emerge as a topic of discussion among scholars and literature in the 19th and 20th century, from that feminist institutionalism began to stem. Feminist institutionalism came to be popular because many feminist political scientists wanted to highlight the ways in which there is a gendered lens on political institutions. Feminist institutionalism has been looked at as adding a new dimension of understanding to new institutionalism in terms of power and the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist institutionalism wishes to touch upon both the strengths and limitations of institutions.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the past feminist institutionalism has critiqued institutions for their gendered blindness of the existing field, and highlights that gender is embedded in political institutions and that in turn this is shaping social interactions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInitiatives and organizations have formed to promote and make the public more aware of feminism and institutionalism. In 1987 the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]] (FMF) formed in the United States. They are dedicated to research and action to empower women economically, socially and politically, this group aims to advance the legal, social and political equality of women with men.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/welcome/index.html|title=About the Feminist Majority Foundation|website=www.feminist.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Another organization founded in 1987 is [[Institute for Women's Policy Research|Institute for Women's Policy Research]] whose aim is to advance women's status by developing new policy ideas, encouraging public debate and promoting sound policy and program development through a gendered lends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://iwpr.org/about/our-mission/|title=Our Mission - Institute for Women's Policy Research|work=Institute for Women's Policy Research|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}</ref> More recently in 2006 the Feminism and Institutional International Network (FIIN) emerged with scholars from Scotland, England, Denmark, Sweden and the USA participating in their workshops. This network aims to look at the approaches of gendered institutions and how these approaches address issues of gender, politics, power and change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femfiin.com/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Feminism and Institutionalism International Network|website=www.femfiin.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Since then these scholars have gone on to publish a hand full of research papers on the topic.\n\n== Gender Roles ==\nGender makes up a big part of feminist institutionalism, and is one of the main driving factors that pushes and influences research on institutionalism. Gender underlines choices that are being made and is ever present in the subconscious, guiding final decisions concerning institutions. Many scholars believe that gender is something that has been overlooked, leaving gaps in research and having potential institutional processes missed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acknowledging gendered institutions means that gender is present in various sectors of social life such as practices, processes, images and ideologies and the distribution of power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Acker|first=Joan|year=1992|title=From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=565\u2013569|doi=10.2307/2075528|jstor=2075528}}</ref>\n\nPolitical institutions are guided and influenced by gender through social norms and bias that are created in the public sphere. Institutions such as law, politics, religion, state and the economy have historically been developed by men and have been interpreted through a male perspective, leaving out the standpoint of women.<ref name=\":3\" /> Although gender relations play out differently depending on the specific context, there is a broad agreement among scholars that masculinized gender is embedded in political institutions that are established by and for men.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Sarah|year=2013|title=Negotiating Gendered Institutions : Women's Parliamentary Friendships|url=|journal=Politics & Gender|volume=9|issue=2|pages=127\u2013157|doi=10.1017/S1743923X13000019}}</ref> Gender is built into the fabric of institutions it is not something that has been added on,<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Krook|first=Mona|year=2009|title=Quotas for Women in Politics : Gender and Candidate Selection Reform Worldwide|url=|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195375671.001.0001|isbn=9780195375671}}</ref> in this sense political and policy making institutions are structured by gendered assumptions and produce outcomes such as policies, legislation and rulings that are influenced by these gender norms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nGender can not be overlooked in the broader scope of new institutionalism, a greater understanding of its role needs to be implemented. Recognizing that gender is present in institutions and social interactions provides new insights and power dimensions of political institutions.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal|last=Waylen|first=Georgina|year=2014|title=Informal Institutions, Institutional Change, and Gender Equality|url=|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=67|pages=212\u2013223|doi=10.1177/1065912913510360}}</ref>\n\n== Policies ==\n\n=== Implementation ===\nFeminist institutionalist aim to have policies placed on the political agenda that work to empower women and put them at equal standing with men. Government bodies are dominantly made up of men which feminist and women activists argue that certain policies will be overlooked or not implemented at all because women's opinions are missing from this debate. Policies that are implemented that reflect feminist institutionalism, must go through a process of outside women fighting for their cause. Implementation of feminist policies entails energy from movements and activists while also creating allies within the government who become a crucial factor to getting an issue on the policy agenda.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe type of government that is in power at the time of these policy decisions plays a factor in which policies will and will not be implemented. The election of different governments have downgraded feminist institutional status and their position in such a way that their ability to shape policy has become insignificant.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Chappell|first=Louise|year=2006|title=Comparing Political Institutions : Revealing the Gendered 'Logic of appropriateness'|url=|journal=Politics & Gender|volume=2|issue=2|pages=223\u2013235|doi=10.1017/S1743923X06221044}}</ref> Shifting government comes with a change in opinions which can either move these feminist policies forward or push them aside.

Feminist institutionalism came to be popular because many feminist political scientists wanted to highlight the ways in which there is a gendered lens on political institutions. Feminist institutionalism has been looked at as adding a new dimension of understanding to new institutionalism in terms of power and the dynamics of inclusion and exclusion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Feminist institutionalism wishes to touch upon both the strengths and limitations of institutions.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the past feminist institutionalism has critiqued institutions for their gendered blindness of the existing field, and highlights that gender is embedded in political institutions and that in turn this is shaping social interactions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInitiatives and organizations have formed to promote and make the public more aware of feminism and institutionalism.

This network aims to look at the approaches of gendered institutions and how these approaches address issues of gender, politics, power and change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.femfiin.com/about-us|title=About Us {{!}} Feminism and Institutionalism International Network|website=www.femfiin.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref> Since then these scholars have gone on to publish a hand full of research papers on the topic.\n\n== Gender Roles ==\nGender makes up a big part of feminist institutionalism, and is one of the main driving factors that pushes and influences research on institutionalism. Gender underlines choices that are being made and is ever present in the subconscious, guiding final decisions concerning institutions. Many scholars believe that gender is something that has been overlooked, leaving gaps in research and having potential institutional processes missed.<ref name=\":0\" /> Acknowledging gendered institutions means that gender is present in various sectors of social life such as practices, processes, images and ideologies and the distribution of power.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Acker|first=Joan|year=1992|title=From Sex Roles to Gendered Institutions|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology|volume=21|issue=5|pages=565\u2013569|doi=10.2307/2075528|jstor=2075528}}</ref>\n\nPolitical institutions are guided and influenced by gender through social norms and bias that are created in the public sphere.

Government bodies are dominantly made up of men which feminist and women activists argue that certain policies will be overlooked or not implemented at all because women's opinions are missing from this debate. Policies that are implemented that reflect feminist institutionalism, must go through a process of outside women fighting for their cause. Implementation of feminist policies entails energy from movements and activists while also creating allies within the government who become a crucial factor to getting an issue on the policy agenda.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe type of government that is in power at the time of these policy decisions plays a factor in which policies will and will not be implemented.

Forth was elected as a councillor for the [[Pilgrims Hatch]] ward on the [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]] [[Urban District Council]] from 1968-72. He contested the safe Labour seat of [[Barking (UK Parliament constituency)|Barking]] at both the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]] general elections, where on both occasions he was defeated by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] [[Jo Richardson]].

Originally in favour of membership of the [[European Economic Community]], he would eventually become a [[Eurosceptic]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nHe was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] with a majority of 14,205 votes for the new seat of [[Mid Worcestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid-Worcestershire]]. His political views were apparent from his maiden speech, in which he attacked the Sex Equality Bill, and he was an early member of the [[No Turning Back (political group)|No Turning Back]] group. Following boundary changes to his constituency, he was not selected to fight the new seat with the same name, losing out to the sitting MP for [[Worcester (UK Parliament constituency)|Worcester]], [[Peter Luff]]. Forth found a safe seat in the [[Outer London]] suburbs for [[Bromley and Chislehurst (UK Parliament constituency)|Bromley and Chislehurst]] in the heart of the large [[London Borough of Bromley]].

A supposed descendant of [[Sun Tzu]], Sun was tutored in military strategy by the hermit [[Guiguzi]]. He was accused of [[treason]] while serving in the [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] and was sentenced to face-tattooing (criminal branding) and had his kneecaps removed, permanently crippling him. Sun escaped from Wei later and rose to prominence in the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]], by serving as a military strategist and commander. He led Qi to victory against the Wei state at the [[Battle of Guiling]] and [[Battle of Maling]]. Sun authored the military treatise ''[[Sun Bin's Art of War]]'', which was rediscovered in a 1972 [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|archaeological excavation]] after being lost for almost 2000 years.\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nAn alleged descendant of [[Sun Tzu]], Sun Bin was recognized for his brilliance at an early age, while he was still studying [[military strategy]] under the tutelage of the hermit [[Guiguzi]]. He could recite ''[[The Art of War]]'', which made Guiguzi remark that all his other students should look up to Sun Bin as a role model. [[Pang Juan]], a fellow student of Guiguzi, became [[Blood brother|sworn brother]]s with Sun. Pang left early and went to serve the [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] as a military general, making his name after scoring victories in a few battles. Sun Bin, who was still studying with their teacher then, was invited to enter the service of Wei and he became Pang's colleague. However, Pang was secretly jealous of Sun, because he perceived that Sun Bin was more talented, and had learnt more about military strategy from their teacher than him.\n\n===Mutilation===\n[[Pang Juan]] framed Sun Bin for [[treason]] and reported him to [[King Hui of Wei]], who ordered Sun Bin to be executed. Pang pretended to plead for mercy on Sun's behalf, and the king instead condemned Sun to face-tattooing and removal of the kneecaps, effectively branding Sun as a criminal and crippling him for life. Pang pretended to take pity on Sun and treated him well while trying to trick Sun into compiling his knowledge on military strategy into a book, after which Pang could kill him. Sun eventually realized Pang's true intentions and feigned [[Insanity|madness]]. Pang attempted to test whether Sun had really become insane or not, so he had Sun locked up in a pigsty. Sun appeared to enjoy himself there and even consumed animal [[faeces]], calling them delicious. Pang believed that Sun was truly mad and lowered his guard. Sun later escaped from the Wei state with the help of diplomats from the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]].\n\n===Service in Qi===\n{{Main|Battle of Guiling|Battle of Maling}}\n[[File:Battle of Guiling.png|thumb|320px|Map showing Battle of Guiling]]\n[[File:Battle of Maling.png|thumb|320px|Map showing Battle of Maling]]\nIn the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]], Sun Bin became a [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] (guest) in the residence of [[Tian Ji]], a military general. Once, [[King Wei of Qi]] invited Tian Ji to a horse racing competition. Sun Bin suggested a strategy to Tian Ji to utilize his horses to best advantage, and Tian won two out of three rounds in the race. The king was impressed with Tian's victory. Tian admitted that he won with the help of Sun Bin, and recommended Sun's talents to the king. King Wei wanted to appoint Sun Bin as the commander of the Qi armies. Sun declined, as his handicap prevented him from riding horseback, and would have a negative effect on the morale of soldiers. Sun was then appointed chief military advisor instead and served as Tian Ji's deputy.\n\nIn 354 BC, [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] attacked the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]], with [[Pang Juan]] leading the Wei army. They besieged the Zhao capital city of [[Handan]]. Zhao requested help from Qi, and the king of Qi commissioned Sun Bin and Tian Ji to lead an army to help Zhao. Sun Bin proposed the strategy of \"besieging Wei to rescue Zhao\" and the Qi army attacked the Wei capital city of Daliang (present-day [[Kaifeng]]), forcing the Wei army to turn back to save the city and effectively lifting the siege on Handan. The Wei army was ambushed and defeated by the Qi forces at the [[Battle of Guiling]].\n\nIn 342 BC, the Wei army led by Pang Juan invaded the [[Han (state)|Han state]], an ally of the Qi state, and Han requested help from Qi. Sun Bin and Tian Ji were put in charge of the Qi army again to counter the Wei forces. Sun used a strategy of feigning defeat in a series of skirmishes with the Wei forces, in order to lure Pang Juan to pursue him. Sun ordered the Qi troops to reduce the number of cooking stoves they used, to create a false impression that the Qi army was shrinking in size. The pursuing Wei forces led by Pang Juan spotted the trend by observing the marks left behind by the stoves, and Pang fell for Sun Bin's ruse. Eager to defeat Sun Bin, Pang continued the pursuit and fell into an ambush in a narrow valley laid by the Qi forces. The Wei army suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Maling]] and Pang Juan committed suicide, while the crown prince of Wei was captured by the Qi forces. In traditional folklore, Sun Bin carved the words \"Pang Juan dies under this tree\" on a tree in the ambush area. When Pang arrived there, he saw that there were carvings on the tree so he lit a torch for a closer look. Right then, using the torch as the target, the Qi troops lying in ambush attacked. Pang committed suicide after being hit by many enemy arrows.\n\nSun Bin retired from service because of political entanglement in the court and led a reclusive life as a hermit in the later part of his life.\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|Sun Bin's Art of War}}\n''Sun Bin's Art of War'' (\u5b6b\u81cf\u5175\u6cd5) is a military treatise authored by Sun Bin. The book was believed to be lost after the [[Han Dynasty]], and although there were numerous references to it in post-contemporary texts, some historians still believed that the book was never written and could be a forgery. However, in April 1972, archaeologists excavated [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|several fragments of scrolls]] from a tomb in [[Linyi]], Shandong province. ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' was found among the scrolls. Although ancient texts mention that the original ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' was 89 chapters long, the rediscovered copy had 16 verifiable chapters only. As fragments of [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'' were discovered as well, historians believed that some of the chapters might belong to ''The Art of War'' instead.\n\nThe newly discovered text provided historians with a different perspective on the [[Battle of Guiling]] and [[Battle of Maling]]. In addition, when compared to Sun Tzu's ''The Art of War'', ''Sun Bin's Art of War'' contained one major difference from the former. The former advised against [[siege warfare]], while the latter suggested tactics for attacking a besieged city. This paralleled a shift in the strategic consideration of siege warfare during the later stages of the [[Warring States period]].\n\n==Legacy==\nSun Bin sometimes appears as a [[door god]] in [[Chinese temple|Chinese]] and [[Taoist temple]]s, usually paired with [[Pang Juan]].\n\nHis rivalry with Pang Juan is portrayed in the 2011 film ''[[The Warring States (film)|The Warring States]]''.\n\nSun Bin is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'' by [[Koei]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pang Juan]]\n*[[Sun Bin's Art of War|Sun Bin's ''Art of War'']]\n*[[Yinqueshan Han Slips]]\n\n==References==\n*The Seven Military Classics of Ancient China.

A supposed descendant of [[Sun Tzu]], Sun was tutored in military strategy by the hermit [[Guiguzi]]. He was accused of [[treason]] while serving in the [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] and was sentenced to face-tattooing (criminal branding) and had his kneecaps removed, permanently crippling him. Sun escaped from Wei later and rose to prominence in the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]], by serving as a military strategist and commander. He led Qi to victory against the Wei state at the [[Battle of Guiling]] and [[Battle of Maling]]. Sun authored the military treatise ''[[Sun Bin's Art of War]]'', which was rediscovered in a 1972 [[Yinqueshan Han Slips|archaeological excavation]] after being lost for almost 2000 years.\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n==Life==\n===Early life===\nAn alleged descendant of [[Sun Tzu]], Sun Bin was recognized for his brilliance at an early age, while he was still studying [[military strategy]] under the tutelage of the hermit [[Guiguzi]]. He could recite ''[[The Art of War]]'', which made Guiguzi remark that all his other students should look up to Sun Bin as a role model. [[Pang Juan]], a fellow student of Guiguzi, became [[Blood brother|sworn brother]]s with Sun. Pang left early and went to serve the [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] as a military general, making his name after scoring victories in a few battles. Sun Bin, who was still studying with their teacher then, was invited to enter the service of Wei and he became Pang's colleague. However, Pang was secretly jealous of Sun, because he perceived that Sun Bin was more talented, and had learnt more about military strategy from their teacher than him.\n\n===Mutilation===\n[[Pang Juan]] framed Sun Bin for [[treason]] and reported him to [[King Hui of Wei]], who ordered Sun Bin to be executed. Pang pretended to plead for mercy on Sun's behalf, and the king instead condemned Sun to face-tattooing and removal of the kneecaps, effectively branding Sun as a criminal and crippling him for life. Pang pretended to take pity on Sun and treated him well while trying to trick Sun into compiling his knowledge on military strategy into a book, after which Pang could kill him. Sun Bin eventually realized Pang's true intentions and feigned [[Insanity|madness]]. Pang attempted to test whether Sun had really become insane or not, so he had Sun locked up in a pigsty. Sun appeared to enjoy himself there and even consumed animal [[faeces]], calling them delicious. Pang believed that Sun was truly mad and lowered his guard. Sun Bin later escaped from the Wei state with the help of diplomats from the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]].\n\n===Service in Qi===\n{{Main|Battle of Guiling|Battle of Maling}}\n[[File:Battle of Guiling.png|thumb|320px|Map showing Battle of Guiling]]\n[[File:Battle of Maling.png|thumb|320px|Map showing Battle of Maling]]\nIn the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]], Sun Bin became a [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] (guest) in the residence of [[Tian Ji]], a military general. Once, [[King Wei of Qi]] invited Tian Ji to a horse racing competition. Sun Bin suggested a strategy to Tian Ji to utilize his horses to best advantage, and Tian won two out of three rounds in the race. The king was impressed with Tian's victory. Tian admitted that he won with the help of Sun Bin, and recommended Sun's talents to the king. King Wei wanted to appoint Sun Bin as the commander of the Qi armies. Sun declined, as his handicap prevented him from riding horseback, and would have a negative effect on the morale of soldiers. Sun was then appointed chief military advisor instead and served as Tian Ji's deputy.\n\nIn 354 BC, [[Wei (state)|Wei state]] attacked the [[Zhao (state)|Zhao state]], with [[Pang Juan]] leading the Wei army.
