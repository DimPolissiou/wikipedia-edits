Delta Air Lines and its regional affiliates account for about 70% of the airport's passenger traffic. The airport is operated by the [[Metropolitan Airports Commission]], which also handles the operation of six smaller airports in the region.\n\n==History==\n[[File:MSPrunways.jpg|thumb|MSP airport in 2009 looking towards the northeast]]\nThe airport came into being when several local groups came together to take control of the former bankrupt Twin City Speedway race track, giving the airport its original name, [[Speedway Field]]. Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]]. The terminal has since been expanded and has a total of 14 gates.\n\nConcourses A and B opened on June 1, 2002 as part of a $250 million terminal expansion designed by Minneapolis-based Architectural Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Two New Concourses to Debut at Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport|first=Eric|last=Torbenson|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg21574.html|newspaper=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=May 31, 2002|accessdate=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023523/http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg21574.html|archive-date=March 4, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The final component of the project included a $17.5 million extension of Concourse C consisting of six additional gates, which opened on October 31, 2002.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Concourse Opens at Minneapolis Airport's Main Terminal|first=Dan|last=Wascoe Jr.|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg23770.html|newspaper=[[Star Tribune]]|location=Minneapolis|date=November 1, 2002|accessdate=July 1, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204222826/http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg23770.html|archive-date=December 4, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIcelandair started service to [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul]] from Reykjavik in 1998. Northwest operated 747-400s from Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998; both were dropped later that year. Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035. The plan moves some, but not all non-SkyTeam airlines from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2, evens out capacity over the two terminals and will finish with as many as 15 new gates being constructed over both terminals and new parking garages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://metroairports.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=1&clip_id=1455&meta_id=8795|title=LTCP MSP 2035|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\n[[File:MSP Airport Diagram.pdf|thumb|FAA airport diagram]]\n[[File:Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport departures area.jpg|thumb|Delta Ticketing/Check-In at Terminal 1]]\n[[File:Delta - Concourse C @ MSP Airport (8486514293).jpg|thumb|Delta Airlines jets parked at Concourse C]]\nLike many other airports, MSP interconnects with several other forms of transportation. Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005. Prior to that time, a number of buildings (including several hangars and the [[Richfield, Minnesota|City of Richfield]]'s Rich Acres Golf Course) were demolished to make way for the runway protection zone of the new runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Aircraft approaching Runway 35 fly slightly east of the [[Mall of America]], overfly [[Interstate 494]] and land seconds later. Due to noise concerns from south [[Minneapolis]], between August 13, 2007 and October 18, 2007, Runway 17/35 was used regularly during construction on Runway 12R/30L.\n\n===Terminals===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates, both of which were named for famous Minnesotans: the Lindbergh Terminal 1 (named after the aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]) and the smaller Humphrey Terminal 2 (named for former [[United States Vice President|US Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]].

Soon after, in 1921, the airport was renamed \"Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field\" for the [[World War I]] pilots Ernest Groves Wold and Cyrus Foss Chamberlain. [[Howard Hughes]] briefly stopped at Wold\u2013Chamberlain Field on his round the world flight in 1938. In 1944 the site was renamed to \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Airport/Wold-Chamberlain Field\", with \"International\" replacing \"Metropolitan\" four years later. Today it is rare to see the Wold\u2013Chamberlain portion of the name used anywhere.\n\nMSP was the main base for [[Northwest Airlines]] starting in 1926 and became the main base of regional carrier [[North Central Airlines]] in 1952. North Central merged with [[Southern Airways]] to form [[Republic Airlines (1979\u20131986)|Republic Airlines]] in 1979; Republic then merged with Northwest in 1986. The combined carrier came to control 79% of traffic at the airport, and merged into [[Delta Air Lines]] in 2010.\n\nGround was broken for the current Charles Lindbergh terminal building on October 26, 1958.<ref name=\"funfacts\">{{cite web|title=Fun Facts|url=http://www.mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|accessdate=June 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609090625/http://mspairport.com/social-media/fun-facts.aspx|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The US $8.5 million, 600,000 square foot (56,000 m<sup>2</sup>) terminal with 24 gates on two concourses was designed by Lyle George Landstrom<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|title=Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport, Lindbergh Terminal, 4300 Glumack Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota|publisher=|access-date=October 22, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729230512/http://www.placeography.org/index.php/Minneapolis-Saint_Paul_International_Airport,_Lindbergh_Terminal,_4300_Glumack_Drive,_Minneapolis,_Minnesota|archive-date=July 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> who worked for Cerny Associates and completed on January 13, 1962 and operations began on January 21, 1962.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /><ref name=\"arch\">{{cite journal |date=2002|title=Architecture Minnesota|journal=Architecture Minnesota|volume=28|issue=1|page=49|publisher=Minnesota Society American Institute of Architects}}</ref> Pier D (formerly the Gold Concourse, now Concourse C) was completed in 1971 and Pier A (formerly the Green Concourse, now Concourse G) was completed in 1972 as part of an expansion of the terminal designed by Cerny Associates.<ref name=\"arch\" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport: Looking Back and Moving Forward|first=Patrick|last=Hogan|url=http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|publisher=Metropolitan Airports Commission|year=2013|accessdate=May 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712062310/http://www.airtap.umn.edu/events/forum/2013/documents/hogan.pdf|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> This project also involved rebuilding the existing concourses into bi-level structures equipped with [[Gate (airport)|holding rooms]] and [[jet bridge]]s.<ref name=\"arch\" /> It handles airlines such as Delta, United and others.

Ironically, MSP was selected in part for notorious winter climate, yet the filming period remained stubbornly fair-weathered, forcing film crews to employ copious amounts of fake snow. As filming had to take place during normal airport operations, several features of the airport itself, such as the color-based labeling of different concourses, were present in the movie. This labeling system was replaced beginning in 2000 with the more familiar system of lettered concourses.\n\nDue in part to aircraft noise in south Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs, proposals were made in the 1990s to build a new airport on the fringes of the Twin Cities metro in [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] to handle larger jets and more international traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSP Intl.

A citizen group named ROAR (Residents Opposed to Airport Racket) was created in 1998 and helped push the MAC to make these concessions. Later, in 2004, the MAC voted to reduce funding for the soundproofing projects, saying in part that the economic climate had turned in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Minneapolis Mayor [[R. T. Rybak]], who had been a founding member of ROAR, promised that the city would challenge the changes.\n\nThe Hubert H. Humphrey Terminal was built in 2001. It is used mostly for charter and low cost airlines, including Minnesota-based [[Sun Country Airlines|Sun Country]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]], but is also used for [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]] and [[JetBlue]].

Northwest operated 747-400s from Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Hong Kong and Osaka in 1998; both were dropped later that year. Northwest also operated DC-10s Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul to Oslo and Frankfurt, but they too were dropped. From the early 1990s to the 2000s (decade), [[KLM]] flew 747s and MD-11s from Amsterdam to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. In part because of the Delta/KLM joint venture, KLM did not serve Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul with its own aircraft between 2004 and March 2017, when service resumed. Beginning in the summer of 2013 [[Air France]] commenced non-stop, seasonal Airbus A340-300 flights from [[Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul. Service switches to a Boeing 777-200ER in 2019. [[Condor Airlines]] began non-stop seasonal 767-300 service to Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul from Frankfurt in the summer of 2014.\n\n[[Great Lakes Airlines]] added services to small communities that had lost service from the legacy carriers in the 2010s, but hub status was removed in 2014, with the airline blaming a lack of qualified pilots. Some service moved to other airports, while other service was picked up by [[Air Choice One]] and [[Boutique Air]].\n\nThe [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]] typically screens about 34,000 people at MSP daily and screens about 18,000 checked bags. The airport's current record for passengers and bags was set on February 5, 2018, which was the day after [[Super Bowl LII]]. That record is 60,883 passengers screened at TSA checkpoints and 34,368 checked bags screened.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|title=One Day After 60K-Plus Passengers, MSP Officials Overjoyed|work=KSTP|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207015952/http://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-st-paul-international-airport-officials-overjoyed-day-after-record-60-thousand-passengers-screened/4775384/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> For the event, the TSA brought in more than 100 additional agents and 20 canines to MSP for the expected number of passengers.\n\n===Future===\nIn 2004 Northwest Airlines proposed expanding the Lindbergh Terminal 1 to accommodate growing flight operations in a plan known as the ''MSP 2020 Vision''. The proposed expansion included moving all airlines other than [[Northwest Airlines]] and its [[SkyTeam]] alliance partners to the Humphrey Terminal 2. This caused increased concern about Northwest Airlines' control of the Minneapolis/St. Paul commercial air service market with some claiming that Northwest was using its market position to inflate airfares. While [[AirTran Airways]] voiced opposition to the plan, [[American Airlines]] and [[United Airlines]] remained neutral on the move since both had exclusive terminals at their own main hubs. Despite the merger between Northwest and [[Delta Air Lines]], there are still plans in place to carry out these expansions. In August 2015, the Metropolitan Airports Commission (MAC) approved a plan that looks out to the year 2035. At the meeting the airlines were split into three groups: All [[SkyTeam]] airlines, [[Southwest Airlines]] and all other passenger airlines.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111800/https://www.mspairport.com/docs/about-msp/long-term-comprehensive-plan/2010/05-Chapter-3-Facility-Requirements.aspx |archivedate=March 4, 2016  }}</ref>\n\nThe final plan includes three phases through 2020, 2030 and 2035.

Several large [[parking ramp]]s are available for [[automobiles|cars]]. Most other connections are made at the Hub Building and adjacent Transit Center, which has city and shuttle bus, [[taxicab|taxi]], [[light-rail]] and [[renting|rental]] car service. Two [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Airport Trams|trams]] ([[people mover]]s) are at the airport. One carries passengers from the main section of Lindbergh Terminal 1 to the Hub Building and another runs along [[Concourse]] C in that terminal.\n\nThe airport is near [[Fort Snelling]], the site of one of the earliest United States government settlements in the area. Both the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] rivers flow nearby. [[Minnesota State Highway 5]] provides the closest entrance to the Lindbergh Terminal 1, just a short distance from [[Interstate 494]]. The Humphrey Terminal 2 is accessed via the 34th Avenue exit from I-494, which runs past [[Fort Snelling National Cemetery]]. Delta Air Lines has hangars arranged along I-494 and 34th Avenue, so it's possible to see airliners undergoing maintenance while driving past.\n\n===Runways===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport covers 2,930 acres (1,186 ha) and has four [[runway]]s, all with high intensity lights.<ref name=\"FAA\" />\n\nRunway 17/35 opened in October 2005. Prior to that time, a number of buildings (including several hangars and the [[Richfield, Minnesota|City of Richfield]]'s Rich Acres Golf Course) were demolished to make way for the runway protection zone of the new runway.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Aircraft approaching Runway 35 fly slightly east of the [[Mall of America]], overfly [[Interstate 494]] and land seconds later. Due to noise concerns from south [[Minneapolis]], between August 13, 2007 and October 18, 2007, Runway 17/35 was used regularly during construction on Runway 12R/30L.\n\n===Terminals===\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport has two terminals with a total of 131 gates, both of which were named for famous Minnesotans: the Lindbergh Terminal 1 (named after the aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]]) and the smaller Humphrey Terminal 2 (named for former [[United States Vice President|US Vice President]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The terminals are on different sides of the airfield and not interconnected; one who wishes to transfer between terminals must take the free Light Rail.\n\n'''Lindbergh Terminal 1''', the larger of the two terminals, has seven concourses, lettered A\u2013G, although they are all interconnected and can be accessed by either the north or south security checkpoints. Terminal 1 currently has 117 gates. Concourse C has a tram that goes from Gate C1 to gate C27, with a stop in the middle near Gate C12. There is a skyway that connects concourse G with concourse C. All international arrivals at Terminal 1 from airports without border pre-clearance are handled at concourse G. Terminal 1 houses the [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] hub, as well as [[Air Canada]], [[Air Choice One]], [[Alaska Airlines|Alaska]], [[American Airlines|American]], [[Boutique Air]], [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]], [[Spirit Airlines|Spirit]] and [[United Airlines|United]]. Delta operates two Sky Clubs within the terminal, while United operates a United Club in Concourse E.\n\n'''Humphrey Terminal 2''', consists entirely of Concourse H. The old Humphrey Terminal 2, built in 1986, was rebuilt in 2001 to expand capacity and give passengers a more seamless experience.<ref name=\"funfacts\" /> The terminal now has 14 gates and houses the primary hub for [[Sun Country Airlines]], as well as [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], [[Icelandair]], [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]] and [[Southwest Airlines|Southwest]].\n\n===Ground transportation===\nThe terminal buildings are directly located off of [[Minnesota State Highway 5]]. Several other major highways that border the airport are [[Minnesota State Highway 62 (Hennepin-Dakota Counties)|Minnesota State Highway 62]], [[Minnesota State Highway 77]], and [[Interstate 494]].\n\n[[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]] operates bus route 54 to MSP.
