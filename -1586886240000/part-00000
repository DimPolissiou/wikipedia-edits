He was born on 14 February 1859 (St Valentine's Day) in [[St Pancras, London]], and there is no evidence that he was ever baptised.\n\n== Education ==\nLike his father and grandfather before him, he embarked on a medical career. There is no evidence of an [[apprenticeship]] but he obtained his [[Licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries|LSA]] in 1881 after studying at [[University College London]]. He was awarded his [[Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]] and his LM in the same year and also an [[LRCP]] from the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1889 he is recorded as being a fellow of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]].\n\n== A physician ==\nHe worked in the service of the [[Peninsular and Oriental Steamship Company]] from 1883 to 1886 presumably on their liners. In 1889 he was resident surgeon at [[Boscombe Infirmary]] but his address, from 1883 until 1912 was 189 Camden Road, London NW where he was in general practice as a doctor.\n\n== Family ==\nHe married Mabel Emily Stow on 24 June 1897 at St Paul's Church, St Pancras \u2013 Mabel's father James was just described as \"gentleman\" on the marriage certificate. They had two daughters \u2013 Dulcie (born 1901, who married George Menzies Trevor Lambrick (an officer in the [[Indian Army]]) 1929 in [[Witney]]), and Nora (born 1902, who married John B.

In 1914 he was living at 41 Queen Anne Street, then, to 1921 (and probably later) he was practising from the up-market address of 25 Wimpole Street, but he was living at \"Arbor\", Kings Langley in rural Hertfordshire. His specialities were listed as [[electro-therapeutics]], [[dietetics]] and [[haematology]], and his recreations as [[sport of athletics|athletics]] and literary work of various kinds.\n\nEven late in his life he continued in practice, in his 80s seeing patients in London's West End during [[The Blitz]], \"for which he had a nonchalant disregard\".<ref name=timesobit/>\n\nIn 1954 he was living in 80 Leigh Gardens, Kensal Rise, London.\n\n== His publications ==\n\nKnaggs was a prolific author.

But by far the more numerous are his books and pamphlets for the [[general public]]. They are mostly on various aspects of personal health and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and have been described as \"mostly harmless.\" Examples are \"Rheumatism and Allied Ailments,\" \"The Cleansing Saline Fast,\" \"The Misunderstood Microbe\", \"How to Prevent Cancer\" and \"Potatoes as Food and Medicine\" (the last one still in print).\n\n== His ideas ==\n\nHe was a naturopath and [[teetotal]]ing vegetarian, an advocate of [[Orthopathy|natural hygiene]], and a long-time member of the [[National Anti-Vaccination League]]. He is reported as saying that during the last fifty years as a physician he never prescribed a single drug. He preferred [[raw food]]s to cooked ones, and plain water to milk and beverages such as tea and coffee. He was an advocate of exercise and shunned alcohol.\n\nKnaggs was influenced by [[Antoine B\u00e9champ]] and believed that germs were not the cause of disease but the products of tissue breakdown.<ref name=\"Brown 1991\"/> He held pseudoscientific and [[Vitalism|vitalistic]] ideas. An article in the ''[[Medical History]]'' journal noted that Knaggs believed that the \"human body took in three streams of \"solar life essence\", as light, as air, and as food and water: and that uncooked vegetables were \"fully charged with magnetism\" drawn from sun, earth and water.\"<ref name=\"Brown 1991\"/> His vitalistic ideas were ridiculed in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' as unscientific.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25286653 ''\"Herbalists\" And Medical Practice''].

The mountains sit on the western side of the [[Continental Divide]], largely in southern [[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin]] and northern [[Gunnison County, Colorado|Gunnison]] counties, in the area southwest of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], south of the [[Roaring Fork River]] valley, and east of the [[Crystal River (Colorado)|Crystal River]]. The range sits west of the [[Sawatch Range]] and northeast of the [[West Elk Mountains]]. Much of the range is located within the [[White River National Forest]] and the [[Gunnison National Forest]], as well as the [[Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness]] and [[Raggeds Wilderness]]. The Elk Mountains rise nearly 9,000&nbsp;ft. above the Roaring Fork Valley to the north.\n\nThe highest peaks in the range are its [[fourteeners]], [[Castle Peak (Colorado)|Castle Peak]] (14,265&nbsp;ft), [[Maroon Bells|Maroon Peak]] (14,156&nbsp;ft), [[Capitol Peak (Colorado)|Capitol Peak]] (14,130&nbsp;ft), [[Snowmass Mountain]] (14,092&nbsp;ft), [[Pyramid Peak (Colorado)|Pyramid Peak]] (14,018&nbsp;ft), and [[Maroon Bells|North Maroon Peak]] (14,014&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"north_maroon\">North Maroon Peak does not meet the usual criterion for independence of having 300 feet or more of [[topographic prominence]], but it is included on many lists of fourteeners.</ref> Maroon Peak and North Maroon Peak are collectively known as the [[Maroon Bells]], a popular destination for recreation [[alpinism]]. [[Mount Sopris]] (12,953&nbsp;ft) sits at the northwest end of the range and dominates the skyline of the lower Roaring Fork Valley and the town of [[Carbondale, Colorado]], serving as an unofficial symbol of the area. \n[[Image:Maroonlake.JPG|thumb|Maroon Lake, Elk Mountains.]]\n\nAdditional notable peaks in the range include:\n* [[Cathedral Peak (Colorado)|Cathedral Peak]], 13,943&nbsp;ft (4,250 m), near [[Pyramid Peak (Colorado)|Pyramid Peak]]\n* [[Hagerman Peak]], 13,841&nbsp;ft (4,219 m), near [[Snowmass Mountain]]\n* [[Snowmass Peak]], 13,620&nbsp;ft (4,151 m), near [[Hagerman Peak]]\n* [[Clark Peak (Elk Mountains, Colorado)|Clark Peak]], 13,580&nbsp;ft (4,139 m), near [[Capitol Peak (Colorado)|Capitol Peak]]\n* [[Treasure Mountain (Colorado)|Treasure Mountain]], 13,528&nbsp;ft (4,123 m), southwest of the [[Maroon Bells]]\n* [[Mount Owen (Colorado)|Mount Owen]], 13,058&nbsp;ft (3,980 m), high point of the [[Ruby Range (Colorado)|Ruby Range]]\n* [[Mount Sopris]], 12,965&nbsp;ft (3,952 m), north west of Capitol Peak\n* [[Chair Mountain]], 12,721&nbsp;ft (3,877 m), high point of [[The Raggeds (Colorado)|The Raggeds]]\n* [[Crested Butte]], 12,162&nbsp;ft (3,706 m), home of [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]] [[ski area|Mountain Resort]]\n* [[Whitehouse Mountain]], 11,975&nbsp;ft (3,650 m), northwest of Treasure Mountain\n\nThe range provides a formidable barrier to travel and is traversed only by backroad passes and trails, including [[Schofield Pass (Colorado)|Schofield Pass]], [[Pearl Pass]], and [[Taylor Pass (Colorado)|Taylor Pass]]. [[Colorado State Highway 133|State Highway 133]] traverses [[McClure Pass]], at the western end of the range. The range has been the site of mining activity since the days of the [[Colorado Silver Boom]], which saw the founding of mining towns such as Aspen and [[Ashcroft, Colorado|Ashcroft]]. In the late 19th century, the western and southern flank of the range became the site of intense [[coal]] mining activity which continues to the present day.  Treasure Mountain, overlooking the town of Marble, is home to the famous Yule Marble Quarry.

[[Rocky Mountains]] of west-central [[Colorado]] in the [[United States]]. The mountains sit on the western side of the [[Continental Divide]], largely in southern [[Pitkin County, Colorado|Pitkin]] and northern [[Gunnison County, Colorado|Gunnison]] counties, in the area southwest of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], south of the [[Roaring Fork River]] valley, and east of the [[Crystal River (Colorado)|Crystal River]]. The range sits west of the [[Sawatch Range]] and northeast of the [[West Elk Mountains]]. Much of the range is located within the [[White River National Forest]] and the [[Gunnison National Forest]], as well as the [[Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness]] and [[Raggeds Wilderness]]. The Elk Mountains rise nearly 9,000&nbsp;ft. above the Roaring Fork Valley to the north.\n\nThe highest peaks in the range are its [[fourteeners]], [[Castle Peak (Colorado)|Castle Peak]] (14,265&nbsp;ft), [[Maroon Bells|Maroon Peak]] (14,156&nbsp;ft), [[Capitol Peak (Colorado)|Capitol Peak]] (14,130&nbsp;ft), [[Snowmass Mountain]] (14,092&nbsp;ft), [[Pyramid Peak (Colorado)|Pyramid Peak]] (14,018&nbsp;ft), and [[Maroon Bells|North Maroon Peak]] (14,014&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"north_maroon\">North Maroon Peak does not meet the usual criterion for independence of having 300 feet or more of [[topographic prominence]], but it is included on many lists of fourteeners.</ref> Maroon Peak and North Maroon Peak are collectively known as the [[Maroon Bells]], a popular destination for recreation [[alpinism]]. [[Mount Sopris]] (12,953&nbsp;ft) sits at the northwest end of the range and dominates the skyline of the lower Roaring Fork Valley and the town of [[Carbondale, Colorado]], serving as an unofficial symbol of the area. \n[[Image:Maroonlake.JPG|thumb|Maroon Lake, Elk Mountains.]]\n\nAdditional notable peaks in the range include:\n* [[Cathedral Peak (Colorado)|Cathedral Peak]], 13,943&nbsp;ft (4,250 m), near [[Pyramid Peak (Colorado)|Pyramid Peak]]\n* [[Hagerman Peak]], 13,841&nbsp;ft (4,219 m), near [[Snowmass Mountain]]\n* [[Snowmass Peak]], 13,620&nbsp;ft (4,151 m), near [[Hagerman Peak]]\n* [[Clark Peak (Elk Mountains, Colorado)|Clark Peak]], 13,580&nbsp;ft (4,139 m), near [[Capitol Peak (Colorado)|Capitol Peak]]\n* [[Treasure Mountain (Colorado)|Treasure Mountain]], 13,528&nbsp;ft (4,123 m), southwest of the [[Maroon Bells]]\n* [[Mount Owen (Elk Mountains, Colorado)|Mount Owen]], 13,058&nbsp;ft (3,980 m), high point of the [[Ruby Range (Colorado)|Ruby Range]]\n* [[Mount Sopris]], 12,965&nbsp;ft (3,952 m), north west of Capitol Peak\n* [[Chair Mountain]], 12,721&nbsp;ft (3,877 m), high point of [[The Raggeds (Colorado)|The Raggeds]]\n* [[Crested Butte]], 12,162&nbsp;ft (3,706 m), home of [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]] [[ski area|Mountain Resort]]\n* [[Whitehouse Mountain]], 11,975&nbsp;ft (3,650 m), northwest of Treasure Mountain\n\nThe range provides a formidable barrier to travel and is traversed only by backroad passes and trails, including [[Schofield Pass (Colorado)|Schofield Pass]], [[Pearl Pass]], and [[Taylor Pass (Colorado)|Taylor Pass]]. [[Colorado State Highway 133|State Highway 133]] traverses [[McClure Pass]], at the western end of the range. The range has been the site of mining activity since the days of the [[Colorado Silver Boom]], which saw the founding of mining towns such as Aspen and [[Ashcroft, Colorado|Ashcroft]]. In the late 19th century, the western and southern flank of the range became the site of intense [[coal]] mining activity which continues to the present day.  Treasure Mountain, overlooking the town of Marble, is home to the famous Yule Marble Quarry.  Quarried marble was used to create The Tomb of the Unknowns, the Lincoln Memorial, Denver Post Office and other buildings. The range receives a great deal of snowfall due to its position to the west of the continental divide and the westerly origin of many winter storms. This is exploited by the [[skiing|ski]] areas in the vicinity of Aspen, which are located on the flanks of smaller mountains alongside the Roaring Fork Valley.\n\n==Prominent peaks==\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+The 21 Peaks of the Elk Mountains With At Least 500 Feet of Topographic Prominence\n![[ranking|Rank]]\n![[summit (topography)|Mountain Peak]]\n![[mountain range|Subrange]]\n![[topographic elevation|Elevation]]\n![[topographic prominence|Prominence]]\n![[topographic isolation|Isolation]]\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|[[Castle Peak (Colorado)|Castle Peak]] {{NGS|KL0659}}\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4352.200 = </span>14,279&nbsp;feet<br/>4352&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0720.852 = </span>2,365&nbsp;feet<br/>721&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00033.71 = </span>20.9&nbsp;miles<br/>33.7&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|[[Maroon Peak]] {{NGS|KL0805}}\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4317.000 = </span>14,163&nbsp;feet<br/>4317&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0712.013 = </span>2,336&nbsp;feet<br/>712&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00012.97 = </span>8.1&nbsp;miles<br/>13.0&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|[[Capitol Peak (Colorado)|Capitol Peak]]\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4308.816 = </span>14,137&nbsp;feet<br/>4309&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0527.304 = </span>1,730&nbsp;feet<br/>527&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00011.98 = </span>7.4&nbsp;miles<br/>12.0&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|4\n|[[Snowmass Mountain]] {{NGS|KL0813}}\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4297.300 = </span>14,099&nbsp;feet<br/>4297&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0345.034 = </span>1,132&nbsp;feet<br/>345&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00003.77 = </span>2.3&nbsp;miles<br/>3.8&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|5\n|[[Pyramid Peak (Colorado)|Pyramid Peak]] {{NGS|HL0589}}\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4274.700 = </span>14,025&nbsp;feet<br/>4275&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0493.166 = </span>1,618&nbsp;feet<br/>493&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00003.36 = </span>2.1&nbsp;miles<br/>3.4&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|6\n|[[Cathedral Peak (Colorado)|Cathedral Peak]] {{NGS|KL0791}} {{pid|5705}}\n|Elk Mountains\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">4252.100 = </span>13,950&nbsp;feet<br/>4252&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">0153.314 = </span>503&nbsp;feet<br/>153&nbsp;m\n|align=center|<span style=\"display:none\">00002.10 = </span>1.3&nbsp;miles<br/>2.1&nbsp;km\n|-\n|align=center|7\n|[[Treasure Mountain (Colorado)|Treasure Mountain]]<ref name=NGVD29>The elevation of this summit has been converted from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] (NGVD 29) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] (NAVD 88).

The base of the anal fin is shorter than that of the second dorsal fin. The [[caudal fin]] has long lobes with the lower usually being the longest; normally it is longer than the distance from the snout to the start of the second dorsal fin. The [[pectoral fin]]s have 12 to 14 simple raysand are located near the midline of the body and may extend beyondthe rear end of the anal fin's base. It has 6 or 7 pectoral filaments; with the fifth filament, the farthest back, being the longest, sometimes reaching past the end of the caudal fin. The pelvic fins reach beyond the anus. There are 50*60 scales in the [[lateral line]]which nds between the centre of the fork of the caudal fin and its first lower ray.
