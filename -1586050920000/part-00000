Rain occurs primarily in the months from November through April. During the winter and spring, hillsides and fields turn green with grasses and vegetation, although [[deciduous]] trees are few. With the coming of the annual hot summer dry period, the vegetation dies and dries, giving the hills a golden cover which, unfortunately, also provides fuel for [[grass fire]]s.\n\nMeasurable precipitation falls in downtown San Jose on an average of 59 days a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2016}} \"Rain year\" precipitation has ranged from {{convert|4.83|in|mm|1}} between July 1876 and June 1877 to {{convert|30.30|in|mm|1}} between July 1889 and June 1890, although at the current site since 1893 the range is from {{convert|5.77|in|mm|1}} in \"rain year\" 1975\u201376 to {{convert|30.25|in|mm|1}} in \"rain year\" 1982\u201383.

Mineta San Jose International Airport]] {{airport codes|SJC|KSJC|SJC}}, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} northwest of downtown, and by [[Reid-Hillview Airport|Reid-Hillview Airport of Santa Clara County]] {{airport codes||KRHV|RHV}} a [[general aviation]] airport located in the eastern part of San Jose. San Jose residents also use [[San Francisco International Airport]] {{Airport codes|SFO|KSFO|SFO}}, a major international hub located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the northwest, and [[Oakland International Airport]] {{Airport codes|OAK|KOAK|OAK}}, another major international airport located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]], [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]], and [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]].\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe San Jose area has a large freeway system, including three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate freeways]] and one [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Route]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.\n\n[[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] runs south to the [[California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981. In 2010, the interchange was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 \u2013 Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Major highways:'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[File:I-280 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]\n* [[File:I-680 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]]\n* [[File:I-880 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]\n* [[File:US 101 (1961 cutout).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]]\n* [[File:California 17.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]]\n* [[File:California 82.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 82|State Route 82]]\n* [[File:California 85.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]]\n* [[File:California 87.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n* [[File:California 130.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]\n* [[File:California 237.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Bicycling ===\n{{main|Cycling in San Jose, California}}\nCentral San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes.

These trails extend from near downtown San Jose for dozens of miles to the north and south, and are connected with each other via bicycle routes of varying quality. The city is planning to construct new trail extensions in coming years including the Three Creeks Trail and San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of people from San Jose, California}}\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSan Jose has one of the oldest [[Twin towns and Sister cities|Sister City programs]] in the nation. In 1957, when the city established a relationship with Okayama, Japan, it was only the third Sister City relationship in the nation, which had begun the prior year. The Office of Economic Development coordinates the San Jose Sister City Program which is part of [[Sister Cities International]]. {{As of|2014}}, there are eight [[sister cities]]:<ref>{{cite web

Rain occurs primarily in the months from November through April. During the winter and spring, hillsides and fields turn green with grasses and vegetation, although [[deciduous]] trees are few. With the coming of the annual hot summer dry period, the vegetation dies and dries, giving the hills a golden cover which, unfortunately, also provides fuel for [[grass fire]]s.\n\nMeasurable precipitation falls in downtown San Jose on an average of 59 days a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=December 2016}} \"Rain year\" precipitation has ranged from {{convert|4.83|in|mm|1}} between July 1876 and June 1877 to {{convert|30.30|in|mm|1}} between July 1889 and June 1890, although at the current site since 1893 the range is from {{convert|5.77|in|mm|1}} in \"rain year\" 1975\u201376 to {{convert|30.25|in|mm|1}} in \"rain year\" 1982\u201383.

San Jose residents also use [[San Francisco International Airport]] {{Airport codes|SFO|KSFO|SFO}}, a major international hub located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the northwest, and [[Oakland International Airport]] {{Airport codes|OAK|KOAK|OAK}}, another major international airport located {{convert|35|mi|km}} to the north. The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]], [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]], and [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]].\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe San Jose area has a large freeway system, including three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate freeways]] and one [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Route]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.\n\n[[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] runs south to the [[California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981. In 2010, the interchange was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 \u2013 Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Major highways:'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[File:I-280 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]\n* [[File:I-680 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]]\n* [[File:I-880 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]\n* [[File:US 101 (1961 cutout).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]]\n* [[File:California 17.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]]\n* [[File:California 82.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 82|State Route 82]]\n* [[File:California 85.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]]\n* [[File:California 87.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n* [[File:California 130.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]\n* [[File:California 237.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Bicycling ===\n{{main|Cycling in San Jose, California}}\nCentral San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes.

These trails extend from near downtown San Jose for dozens of miles to the north and south, and are connected with each other via bicycle routes of varying quality. The city is planning to construct new trail extensions in coming years including the Three Creeks Trail and San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of people from San Jose, California}}\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSan Jose has one of the oldest [[Twin towns and Sister cities|Sister City programs]] in the nation.

[[California Assembly Bill 5 (2019)]] was passed September 18, 2019.\n\n=== ''Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings'' ===\nThe ''Wallace v. Grubhub Holdings'' contractor lawsuit alleges that Carmen Wallace and Broderick Bryant and other drivers were misclassified as independent contractors and Grubhub defied wage-and-hour requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Illinois Minimum Wage Law, and the California Labor Code.\n\nThe plaintiffs in ''Wallace v. Grubhub'' claim that the work of these drivers makes them employees rather than independent contractors. Wallace and Bryant argue that drivers work on scheduled shifts, and must work in certain area. \"The drivers as a general matter cannot engage in personal non-work activities during their GrubHub shifts,\" the complaint states, meaning that they essentially function as employees. They also allege that they do not receive the same benefits that an employee does. Grubhub drivers are allegedly required to pay some of their own expenses. Because of how they are paid, the plaintiffs claim they may often paid below federal or state minimum wage, even when they work long hours. Many drivers allegedly work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive overtime rates for their work.\n\nAccording to the Grubhub contractor lawsuit, the company violated a number of FLSA and Illinois laws by failing to pay overtime and failing to pay minimum wage. The plaintiffs filed their class-action Grubhub contractor lawsuit on June 29, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nMisclassifying workers like Grubhub delivery drivers as independent contractors may allow a company to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime pay, health benefits, insurance, and social security costs.

They also allege that they do not receive the same benefits that an employee does. Grubhub drivers are allegedly required to pay some of their own expenses. Because of how they are paid, the plaintiffs claim they may often paid below federal or state minimum wage, even when they work long hours. Many drivers allegedly work more than 40 hours a week but do not receive overtime rates for their work.\n\nAccording to the Grubhub contractor lawsuit, the company violated a number of FLSA and Illinois laws by failing to pay overtime and failing to pay minimum wage. The plaintiffs filed their class-action Grubhub contractor lawsuit on June 29, 2018, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nMisclassifying workers like Grubhub delivery drivers as independent contractors may allow a company to avoid paying minimum wage, overtime pay, health benefits, insurance, and social security costs. Workers improperly classified in this manner may feel the need to take Grubhub and other companies in court and pursue litigation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/851439-grubhub-contractor-lawsuit-filed-over-failure-to-pay-proper-wages/|title=GrubHub Contractor Lawsuit Filed Over Failure to Pay Proper Wages|date=2018-07-31|website=Top Class Actions |language=en-US |access-date=2019-06-29}}</ref>\n\nBroderick and Carmen filed the lawsuit on behalf of themselves and all others in a similar situation and the case is ongoing.\n\n===Phone fees===\nIn 2019, the company was sued for charging restaurants fees for phone calls taking place on Grubhub-issued phone lines lasting over 45 seconds\u2014whether they resulted in orders or not. Grubhub agreed to extend the refund window for restaurants that have been unwittingly charged for phantom orders. The business itself must review and audit call logs within the refund window in order to identify and dispute fees erroneously charged to them by Grubhub's algorithm.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dugan |first1=Kevin |last2=Fickenscher |first2=Lisa |title=GrubHub extends refunds for fake fees amid pressure from Schumer |url=https://nypost.com/2019/08/01/grubhub-extends-refunds-for-fake-fees-amid-pressure-from-schumer/ |website=New York Post |language=en |date=1 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Grubhub charging us even when our customers don't order: restaurant owners |url=https://nypost.com/2019/05/19/grubhub-is-charging-us-even-when-our-customers-dont-order-lawsuit/ |website=www.nypost.com |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Referral numbers on Yelp listings===\nReporting from an August 2019 episode of podcast Underunderstood found that Yelp listings for some businesses provide Grubhub \"referral numbers\" which, when called instead of the businesses phone number itself, facilitate recording of the calls and can result in commission fees being charged to the business, even in some cases when resulting in no order.<ref>{{cite web |title=Recorded for Awesomeness |url=https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/yelp-grubhub-dark-pattern/ |publisher=Underunderstood |accessdate=19 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[DoorDash]]\n*[[Uber Eats]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.grubhub.com/}}\n* {{Finance links\n| name = Grubhub Inc.\n| symbol = GRUB\n| sec_cik = GRUB\n| yahoo = GRUB\n| google = GRUB\n| bloomberg = GRUB:US\n}}\n\n{{Online food ordering}}\n\n[[Category:Retail companies established in 2004]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2004]]\n[[Category:2014 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange]]\n[[Category:Online food ordering]]\n", "name_user": "Adam Naa", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grubhub"}
