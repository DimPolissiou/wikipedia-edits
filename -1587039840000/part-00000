One SASR operator recalled \"We watched the heat dissipate from his shit in the cold of night.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Hastie's men deployed to make the capture by Bushmasters, along with a Wakunish force element. These were special-forces-like soldiers from the North of Afghanistan, whom Hastie held in high regard. \"The Wakunish were disciplined. They were tactically proficient. They were sensitive to the populace...\" They encircled the target and until first light to act, as per their rules of engagement. The entire mission was observed by the commander of all Special Operations Forces for [[International Security Assistance Force]], Brigadeer Bill Dechow, who \"watched on as the Wakunish made entry and captured the senior objective without bloodshed.\" Hastie regarded it as exemplary of the kind of work special forces could achieve, \"surgical and sensitive to locals.

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

Suicide bomber capture ====\nIntelligence gathering operations constantly scanned for \"chatter\" on plans for suicide bombings by the Taliban. To interdict these operations, Hastie was required to work with local forces, however by May the Wakunish were now working independently, so Australia's forces need to work with the Provincial Response Company<ref name=\":2\" /> with whom they had few shared values. One of the first missions with the PRC was to capture a suicide bomber in [[Urozgan Province|Urozgan]] before he had the opportunity to attack. The operation was conducted in darkness \"When they found the suicide bomber they were chasing, a barrel pressed against his temple was used to ease the man awake.\" Now the enemy was secure, along with his explosive vest, and rockets, the PRC commanders, and their own magistrate, had a stand off with Hastie \u2014 insisting that they should execute the captured man.<ref name=\":2\" /> The \"person under confinement\" was escorted to prison by Hastie and his team. \n\n==== 5. Truck bomb ====\nHastie's B Company received intelligence of a Taliban plan to use a truck to enter their own [[Forward operating base]]. The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties.<blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission. We were protecting the base from attack. We just thought of Aussie diggers, aid workers, [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] and everyone else supporting us behind the wire.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

The order was given for all personnel to put on armour and helmets if they were moving outside of secure buildings. An airstrike was considered once the exact location of the bomber was found, however, it was decided to neutralise the threat using Hastie's unit, on the ground. The force element was flown in on two Australian [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]]<nowiki/>s, the bomber located and killed, and the team extracted. From wheels down to wheels up had taken 22 minutes. There were no force injuries or casualties. <blockquote>It was the SOTG machine at its most efficient and precise. When we got back and the order was given to all on base that they could take off the body armour and helmets when outside there was a sigh of relief. There was no doubt about that mission.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty.

With the evolution of sales under [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) contracts, many other air forces have also acquired F-16s.  Most nations that have bought F-16s continue to use them as of 2010.\n\nThe F-16 is still in demand today, and many air forces are looking to replace aging inventories with F-16s.  Because the USAF has steadily upgraded its F-16 inventory, it will sometimes sell older aircraft it considers obsolete as [[military surplus|surplus]] Excess Defense Articles (EDAs) or as [[Complete knock down|\"knockdown\"]] aircraft to supplement [[Spare part|spares inventories]].\n\n== United States operators ==\n[[File:F-16 Fighting Falcons above New York City.jpg|thumb|[[USAF Air Demonstration Squadron|USAF Thunderbirds]] over [[New York City]]]]\n\nSeveral commands of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) as well as the [[United States Navy]] (USN) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) use various models of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\n=== United States Air Force ===\nThe USAF operates 1,245 F-16s with 701 with active forces, 490 with Air National Guard and 54 with Reserve.  These are broken down to 1 F-16A Block 15, 197 F-16C/D Block 25, 350 F-16C/D Block 30, 51 F-16C/D Block 32, 222 F-16C/D Block 40, 174 F-16C/D Block 42, 198 F-16C/D Block 50, 52 F-16C/D Block 52.<ref>[[Air Forces Monthly]], December 2007 issue, p. 43-44.</ref>\n\n==== Air Combat Command ====\n[[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) is the descendant of the merger of the [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) and [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC).  ACC is the primary combat aircraft operator of the United States Air Force.  Originally, all new F-16s would be delivered to TAC or ACC and then transferred to other commands, but now aircraft are often delivered directly to the other commands.\n\n* [[20th Fighter Wing]] - [[Shaw Air Force Base|Shaw AFB]], [[South Carolina]]\n** [[55th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[77th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[79th Fighter Squadron]]\n* [[53d Wing]] - [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]], [[Florida]]\n** [[85th Test and Evaluation Squadron]]\n** [[422d Test and Evaluation Squadron]], Nellis AFB, Nevada\n* [[57th Wing]] - [[Nellis Air Force Base|Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]]\n** [[64th Aggressor Squadron]]\n** [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]]\n\n==== Air Education and Training Command ====\nThe [[USAF Air Education and Training Command|Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) provides for most of the US Air Force's F-16 training facilities and operations.  The command also provides for training of foreign air forces operating the F-16, with two squadrons providing training for Singapore and Taiwan.\n\n* [[54th Fighter Group]] (GSU) - [[Holloman Air Force Base]]\n** [[8th Fighter Squadron]] \n** 54th Operations Support Squadron\n** 54th Training Squadron\n** [[311th Fighter Squadron]] \n** [[314th Fighter Squadron]] \n\n* [[56th Fighter Wing]] - [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke AFB]], [[Arizona]]\n** [[21st Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[308th Fighter Squadron]] (former operator)\n** [[309th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[310th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[425th Fighter Squadron]]\n\n[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight.jpg|thumb|Prototype F-16 alongside the prototype [[Northrop YF-17|F-17]]]]\n\nThe descendant of the merger of the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) and the [[Air Force Logistics Command]] (AFLC), [[Air Force Materiel Command]] is responsible for providing, testing, and maintaining US Air Force equipment.  As such, it plays a large part in the F-16 program, both in testing the aircraft and its weapon systems.  It utilizes the F-16 for numerous tests for weapons equipping many US Air Force aircraft.  Additionally, it operates overhaul programs to maintain the F-16 fleet of not only the US Air Force, but several foreign air forces as well.\n\n==== Air Force Reserve Command ====\nThe delivery of the F-16 to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) marked the first aircraft type to be delivered new, changing the long policy of merely passing older airframes on from the active forces to the Air Force Reserve.  AFRC currently operates Block 25, 30, and 32 aircraft.\n\n* [[301st Fighter Wing]] - [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth|NAS JRB Fort Worth]], [[Texas]]\n** [[457th Fighter Squadron]]\n* [[482d Fighter Wing]] - [[Homestead Air Reserve Base|Homestead JARB]], [[Florida]]\n** [[93d Fighter Squadron]]\n* [[944th Fighter Wing]] - [[Luke Air Force Base|Luke AFB]], [[Arizona]]\n** [[69th Fighter Squadron]]\n\n==== Air National Guard ====\nAs with the Air Force Reserve, the F-16 marked the transition of the [[Air National Guard]] (ANG) to a viable fighting force complementary to active-duty units, as opposed to the second-line force of out-of-date aircraft it had been.

The lightweight F-16 was ideal for the job, and the F-16N version was specifically developed for the task.  With removal of the internal cannon (compensated by ballast), the F-16N and two-seat TF-16N served for a number of years before retirement.  The F-16 was reintroduced to the aggressor role for the US Navy with the acquisition of some of the Pakistani F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft embargoed before delivery to that country and they remain in use today at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) at NAS Fallon, Nevada.  The US Navy operates 40 F-16s.<ref>[http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article24.html F-16 Users: US Navy], F-16.net.

Its fleet contains two exotic F-16 models (bailed from USAF), the [[F-16XL]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|F-16A AFTI]], both involved in researching advanced technologies for application to not only the F-16, but other aircraft as well.  Additionally, a number of standard F-16s have been operated by NASA as chase aircraft and engine testbeds.\n\n== Original NATO partners ==\nOnce selected by the United States, it was further decided to form a partnership between the [[United States Air Force]], then beginning development of the plane for service, and nations of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] alliance who had a similar need for a lightweight fighter.  Four such nations chose to join the development effort, and became part as well of the production and sub-contracting work to build the Fighting Falcon.  The four European partners, collectively known as the European Participating Governments (EPG), are [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]]; their air forces are likewise referred to as the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF).\n\n<div align=center>\n<gallery>\nFile:General Dynamics F-16AM Fighting Falcon, Belgium - Air Force JP6689918.jpg|Belgium\nFile:F-16 (5167369409).jpg|Denmark\nFile:General Dynamics F-16AM Fighting Falcon, Netherlands - Royal Air Force JP7401086.jpg|Netherlands\nFile:General Dynamics (Fokker) F-16AM Fighting Falcon (401), Norway - Air Force AN0636300.jpg|Norway\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Belgian Air Component|Belgium]] was the largest initial buyer of the F-16 of the four original NATO partners, and Belgium's aeronautical company SABCA was a primary producer of the aircraft as part of the partnership. Belgium's initial order brought delivery of 116 F-16A/B aircraft in blocks 1, 5, 10, and 15, beginning in 1979, and was completed in 1985.  A follow-on order for 44 F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft was completed in 1991. Most of the Danish F-16s were also manufactured in Belgium. Many of the Belgian and Danish F-16s received the MLU update at SABCA.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[Denmark]] was the smallest member of the NATO partnership, with the [[Royal Danish Air Force]] accepting 58 F-16A/B aircraft under Denmark's initial order.{{when|date=May 2014}} A small follow-on order brought a further twelve aircraft to Denmark, and two further attrition replacement orders were later placed, resulting in a total of 62 F-16AM and 16 F-16BM that entered Danish service.<ref>{{cite web |title=All-Time Aircraft Used List Royal Danish Air Force |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/user/every/denmark-af-all-time-aircraft-used-list.htm |website=Aeroflight |accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:F-16 Demo Team 2722.jpg|thumb|right|A Dutch F-16 in a special orange livery for air displays]]\n\nThe [[Netherlands]], like Belgium, made substantial orders for the F-16, and built aircraft at the [[Fokker]] plant. Deliveries started in 1979 and ended in 1992. A total of 102 aircraft were initially ordered, but these were followed by substantial follow-on orders for a total of 111 additional aircraft. 52 of these were F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft. These orders brought total Dutch F-16A/B deliveries to 213. 108 of them received the [[F-16 mid-life update|Mid-Life-Update (MLU)]].\n\n=== Norway ===\n[[Norway]] joined the original NATO-USAF partnership to replace its ageing [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] squadrons.  In 1975, Norway placed an order for 72 F-16A/B aircraft, delivered between 1980 and 1984. Unlike the other partners, there have been no follow-up orders, except for a single order in 1989 for two F-16B-15OCU aircraft as replacements for crashed aircraft. All the aircraft have received the [[F-16 mid-life update|Mid-Life-Update (MLU)]], and they received the new, helmet-mounted sighting system.\n\n== Europe ==\n=== Greece ===\n[[File:HAF F-16D Block 52.jpg|thumb|right|An F-16D Block 52+ of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] with [[Conformal fuel tank|Conformal Fuel Tanks]]]]\n\nAfter protracted negotiations the [[Hellenic Air Force]] ordered the F-16 in 1985. FMS program PEACE XENIA was begun with delivery of 40 F-16C/D Block 30 aircraft in 1989 and 1990.  This was followed by an order for 40 F-16C/D Block 50 fighters, delivered in 1997 and 1998. In June 2000 a further order for 50 F-16C/D Block 52+ aircraft was made with an option of 10 more fighters, exercised in September 2001. All 60 aircraft (40 C-model aircraft and 20 missionized D-model) were delivered by June 2004. In December 2005 the Greek government signed an LOA for the delivery of 30 additional F-16C/D Block 52M with a not exercised option on 10 more. The latest batch consists of 20 C-models and 10 D-models, while deliveries were completed in 2009.

In the meantime, 24 [[Panavia Tornado ADV]] jets from the [[United Kingdom]] were leased to cover the gap. This lease ran out in 2003, without the Typhoon being ready for service. The solution was provided by a five-year lease of 34 F-16 aircraft with an option to extend the lease for another five years. 30 aircraft were F-16A/B-15ADF while the remaining four aircraft were earlier block aircraft for spares. These were all used U.S. Air Force fighters.\n\nIn June 2010, the Italian Air Force started the return of the F-16s to the United States which was completed on 23 May 2012, when all the Italian F-16 were returned to the USA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/news_article4581.html|title=Italian F-16 'Peace Caesar' program comes to an end|work=f-16.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Italian Foreign Military Sales program was known as PEACE CAESAR.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:4061 an F-16C of the Polish Air Forces 31 BLT (4543635562).jpg|thumb|Polish F-16C]]\n\nOne of the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] that was looking to replace an aging fleet of Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] (withdrawn in service in 1999 due to their small numbers and uneconomical operation) and the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighters (withdrawn from service in 2003), [[Poland]] conducted a competition between the [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5 Mk.2]], the [[JAS 39 Gripen]], the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29]] (the last offer was withdrawn), and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Despite a strong challenge by the BAe/SAAB team, Poland purchased 48 F-16C/D-52+ aircraft.

The funds used for the purchase were made available through the [[Foreign Military Sales]] program, partly a payment for the use by the United States of [[Lajes Air Base]] in the [[Azores]]. Initially the United States  proposed to supply Portugal with Block 10 surplus aircraft. However this option rested on a first order of 20 newly built [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16A/B Block 15 OCU|F-16 Block 15 OCU]] (17 A-models and three B-models) with [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] engines, which made them almost identical to the [[Air National Guard|US Air National Guard]]'s F-16 ADF. Deliveries of this first order began on February 18, 1994, and was completed on July 18 in the same year.\n\nThe initial group of Portuguese F-16 pilots was constituted by [[Fighter aircraft|fighter pilots]] from the [[302 Squadron (Portugal)|302]] and [[304 Squadron (Portugal)|304 Squadron]]s, received training in [[Tucson, Arizona]], between January and June 1994.\n\nDuring the [[War in Kosovo]], it was seen that while the Portuguese F-16s were recently obtained, they were no longer up to the same level as most modern fighters used by other NATO countries. In 1999, during the Portuguese participation in the conflict ([[Operation Allied Force]]), the three F-16 fighters deployed by Portugal were relegated to escort missions and combat air patrols due to their lack of modern armament and air-to-ground targeting systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==== Peace Atlantis II ====\nDuring 1996, during the government of then-[[Prime Minister]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], new negotiations took place concerning the possible purchase of new of F-16 fighters and the modernization those aircraft. The Pentagon approved of the deal on November 20, 1997, and on November 30, 1998, Portugal signed the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LoA) for 25 second-hand F - 16 Block 15 (21 A and four B) that had been used by the [[U.S. Air National Guard]]. Under the program these would be offered by the United States at zero cost and free of charge as Excess Defense Articles under the Southern Regional Amendment to the Arms Export and Control Act, with Portugal being responsible for their transportation to Europe and for the modernization costs.\n\nIncluded in the LoA and in the Peace Atlantis II program was also the purchase of new [[Pratt & Whitney F100|Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E]] engines, 20 upgrade kits, logistics support and training.\n\nInitially, the plan consisted in only upgrading the second-hand aircraft of the Peace Atlantis II program and of transferring the F-16s from the Peace Atlantis I to a second squadron with the mission of performing tactical air support actions and tactical air support for maritime operations (TASMO), which wouldn't require the MLU kit.\n\nOf the second-hand F-16s, five of the airframes were used as spare parts, and only the remaining 20 F-16s were intended for upgrade for day & night all-weather operations, by receiving the Falcon UP structural upgrade, the F100-PW-220E engine upgrade and the Mid-Life update (MLU) avionics and cockpit upgrade, to equip the [[301 Squadron (Portugal)|301 Squadron]].\n\n==== Current status ====\nThe [[F-16AM|Mid-Life upgrade]] (MLU) was performed in Portugal by the Air Force's workshops at Monte Real and by [[OGMA]] in Alverca. In 2001, employees of the LMTAS modified the first two aircraft in a Lead-the-Fleet program, with Portuguese technicians observing. The first F-16 AM was delivered on June 2003, and the PoAF personnel performed the modification of the remaining 18 aircraft.\n\nCurrently the Portuguese F-16 fleet uses the AN/ALQ-131 ECM pods, that had originally been bought for the A-7P Corsair IIs, and the new [[LITENING targeting pod|Rafael LITENING II targeting pods]]. One aircraft has been preserved for public display and two aircraft have been lost in accidents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/aircraft-database/F-16/mishaps-and-accidents/airforce/FAP/|title=F-16 Accidents & Mishaps for the Portuguese Air Force|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006 the Portuguese government put 12 F-16 for sale.<ref name=\"areamilitar f16mlu\" /> On September 25, 2012, Romania and Portugal started negotiations for the sale of 12 used F-16s from Portugal in a deal worth $600 million.

Initial talks centered on the F-16N being withdrawn from service with the [[U.S. Navy]] and [[U.S. Marine Corps]], but ultimately, it was decided to purchase ten new Block 40 F-16C aircraft.  Bahrain ordered an additional 16 F-16 Block 70s in November 2017.<ref>https://www.defensenews.com/air/2018/01/19/lockheed-keeps-f-16-production-line-going-with-bahrain-deal/</ref>\n\n=== Egypt ===\nSince the historic [[Camp David Accords|Camp David accords]], [[Egypt]] has actively sought to re-equip its military with western weapons.

The IAF had announced plans to buy 75 F-16s as early as 1978, and deliveries were carried out under American Foreign Military Sales program Peace Marble I. These F-16As and Bs received the nickname [[Hebrew]] \"Netz\" (Hawk). Peace Marble II witnessed the delivery of a further 75 block 30 F-16Cs and F-16Ds to the IAF. Israel's F-16 fleet was further expanded by Peace Marble III, which brought 30 block-40 F-16Cs and 30 two-seat F-16Ds to the IAF between 1991 and 1993. These newer models were nicknamed \"Barak\" (\"lightning\"). In part to reward Israel for its restraint during the [[Gulf War]], a shipment of 50 US-surplus F-16As and F-16Bs were delivered in 1994.\n\nIn a deal worth $4.5 billion, Israel also ordered 102 additional block 52+ F-16Ds, designated the F-16I nicknamed \"Sufa\" (Storm).

Jordan then arranged for a lease of air defense F-16s from the United States, and to transfer ownership eventually.

This agreement, formally signed by Field Marshal Marei, chief of staff of the Royal Jordanian Armed Forces and Major General Ababneh, chief of staff of the Royal Jordanian Air Force, was linked to the Middle East peace process and close US-Jordanian relations. The complete material/training support agreement, known as the F-16 Peace Falcon Program, includes funding for aircraft structural upgrades, engine modifications, support equipment and spare parts procurement, and pilot/maintenance training.\n\nThe agreement consisted of two lease contracts and a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LoA). The first lease was a no-cost lease for Jordan, covering 13 aircraft (12 A models and 1 B model, block 15 OCUs that were modified into ADF (Air Defense Fighters) versions. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the DOD was able to provide these aircraft at a no-cost lease because they had flown off over 75 percent of their life (i.e. more than 3,000 hour). Three of the B-model aircraft still had more than 25 percent of their life left and they fall under the second $4.5 million lease. Both leases cover a 5-year period. The LOA is for $215 million, covering all costs associated with upgrading those aircraft, doing the structural modifications to them, the engine upgrades, providing the support equipment, the logistics, the training.\n\nThe aircraft, all of which have flown previously by active Air Force and Air National Guard units, had been in storage for at least a year at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona before they were shipped to Hill AFB, Utah. There the Aircraft Directorate personnel from the Ogden Air Logistics Center performed structural upgrades to extend aircraft life from the designed 4,000 to 8,000 hours flying time as part of the Falcon-Up/Service Life Improvement program. They also modified the aircraft engine bay to accept the upgraded Pratt and Whitney F100-220E engine. New ground was broken with this Foreign military Sales program: taking 'used' F-16s from the desert (AMARC), completely refurbishing and modifying them and delivering the aircraft to the customer within a 17-month time frame.\n\nOn October 14, 1997 Lt. Col. Scott Curtis, flying safety officer at Hill AFB, pushed the throttles forward and released the brakes on his F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. Within a matter of seconds the aircraft accelerated to 140 knots and the first Jordanian F-16 (tail number #80-0547) was airborne. It took more than 13,000 man-hours to get this F-16 ready for its first flight. The #80-0547 had not flown since November 1994, when it was flown from the ANG Station in Garden City, N.J. to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, Davis-Monthan, Arizona. The official roll-out of the Peace Falcon was on October 28, 1997, on Hill AFB, Utah.\n\nThe Jordan program required that six aircraft be available for ferry flight delivery to Jordan in December 1997, and five each to be available for ferry flight in January and February 1998. At that time, the RJAF planned to acquire as much as 60-70 F-16s (if possible C/D models), enough to equip 3 squadrons.\n\n==== Peace Falcon II ====\n\nThere have been talks about a second batch of 16 refurbished F-16s, which would have been delivered under the Peace Falcon II program. After initial talks in 1999, no further news has become available about this program. The RJAF is still looking for a replacement for its obsolete F-5 fighters which are due within a couple of years. They are in favor of acquiring another batch of F-16s for this replacement.\n\nOn January 29, 2003, numerous sources indicated that Jordan received 6 F-16 fighters that day in a ceremony held at Shahid Muafaq Al-Satlti AFB. This ceremony was attended by prince Faisal bin Hussain and US ambassador Jordan Edward W. Gnehm. The US embassy in Amman stated that these 6 aircraft were the first of a batch of another 17 (12 F-16As and 5 F-16Bs) that would be delivered to Jordan during the year 2003. All these aircraft are former US ANG F-16 ADFs. These aircraft are to be upgraded with the MLU modification (See Modifications and Armament).\n\nUltimately, 16 A-models and 1 B-model was delivered to the RJAF. Most of those airframes were put into storage waiting for their MLU conversion. In 2008 these modifications were in full swing at the TUSAS facility in Ankara, Turkey. By 2009 all of those modified airframes will be delivered back to Jordan for operational use.\n\n==== Peace Falcon III ====\n\nIn 2005 the RJAF contacted the Dutch and Belgian governments for a batch of F-16s. In April 2006 representatives of both air forces flew to Amman to sign a Letter of Intent for the acquisition of up to 22 ex-Dutch (8 airframes) and ex-Belgian (14 airframes) F-16s. The lot would consist of 17 A-models and 5 B-models (Netherlands: 5 A-models, 3 B-models; Belgium: 12 A-models, 2 B-models). All these aircraft have undergone the MLU upgrade which gives the Jordanians a serious boost in air power and also a sneak preview of the possibilities they will gain after their entire fleet is upgraded with this package. The aircraft are due to be delivered in 2007\u20132008.\n\nIn 2009 a total of 16 Belgian F-16s (12 As and 4 Bs) were delivered, but the Dutch order for A-models was canceled. By that time it became apparent that only the 3 B-models of the first purchase from the Netherlands and the 3 B-models included in the second purchase would be handed over to Jordan during 2009 as part of Peace Falcon IV.\n\n==== Peace Falcon IV ====\n\nThe Dutch Secretary of Defence announced at the Dubai Air Show in November 2005 that he had signed a Letter of Intent for the purchase of 3 F-16Bs by the RJAF. The aircraft were to be used as training assets and are due for delivery in 2006.\n\nIn the end, the number of F-16BMs was raised to 6. The delivery of those was postponed until the summer of 2009.\n\n==== Peace Falcon V ====\n\nIn 2009 the Belgian government decided to put another 9 F-16AMs for sale. The first country to respond was Jordan and negotiations have been ongoing till 2011. Finally the delivery consisted of 6 F-16AMs and 3 F-16BMs, all delivered in July 2011. The number of Jordanian F-16s rises to 64 airframes with this delivery.\n\nOn 24 December 2014, a Jordanian F-16 crashed in Syria after being allegedly shot down by ISIS.

An initial order for 40 aircraft was delivered in two installments, and led to a further order for 71 more F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft.  Due to political developments relating to Pakistan's nuclear program, these aircraft were embargoed before delivery.  28 aircraft remained in storage while other buyers were sought (and a [[F-16 Fighting Falcon operators#New Zealand|10 year lease to the Royal New Zealand Air Force]] fell through) due to a change in government, but ultimately it was decided that the aircraft would be put into service with the US Air Force and Navy as aggressor aircraft.  The remaining aircraft on order had work stopped before completion.\n\nThe Pakistani Foreign Military Sales program is known as PEACE GATE.\n\nIn November 2006, the [[Pakistan Air Force]] signed a Letter of Acceptance (LOA) for 18 new-built F-16C/D Block 52, 28 F-16A/B Block 15 and 60 Mid-Life-Update M3 Tape modules/kits as part of a $5.1bn deal including fighter aircraft, their related infrastructure, training and ammunition.

It has operated the aircraft since 1988, when the first of its initial order for 8 F-16A/B-15OCU arrived.  Since then, it has begun ordering multiple installments of F-16C/D Block 52/52+ aircraft, totalling 74 of the advanced fighters.

A more ambitious program (Korean Fighter Program)  to provide 120 new fighters was initially lost to the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], but various difficulties led to the order going to the F-16C/D Block 52D (KF-16C/D), 72 of which were to be manufactured in South Korea, 36 of which were to be delivered in kit form and assembled in South Korea, and 12 of which were to be produced in Fort Worth, U.S.A..  In 2000, a further 20 Korean-built F-16s were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article18.html|title=F-16 Air Forces - South Korea|work=f-16.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe South Korean Foreign Military Sales program is known as PEACE BRIDGE.\n\nIn May 2009, South Korean government announced upgrade plan for its KF-16C/D fleet's radar and armament, as part of the 2010-2014 arms acquisition and management package being submitted to President Lee Myung-bak for approval. The ROKAF operates about 135 of the \u201cKF-16\u201d fighters, many of which were built in Korea under a $5.5 billion licensing agreement from 1994\u20132004. Key upgrades will include new radars to replace the existing APG-68v5/v7 systems, avionics and computers, and improving cabling and databuses to MIL-STD-1760 so that the aircraft will be able to carry GPS-guided weapons, AIM-9X Sidewider missiles, and other new equipment.\n\nIn March 2014, the South Korean Air Force revealed that it was considering leasing F-16s operated by the U.S. Air Force.  ROKAF F-4 and F-5 fighters were intended to be replaced through the [[F-X fighter program#F-X Phase 3|F-X III]] competition by 2016 and the development of the [[KAI KF-X|KF-X]] indigenous fighter, but F-X III deliveries were delayed until 2018 and the KF-X won't enter service until 2023.  With the aging fighters still needing to be retired, between 20 and 60 American F-16s are being reviewed for leasing to sustain aircraft numbers.  South Korea had previously leased U.S. [[T-38 Talon]] trainers for over a decade until the completion of the [[KAI T-50 Golden Eagle]], but a country leasing a combat fighter is very rare due to risk of increased costs if they need to be used in a conflict situation.<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/03/116_154126.html Korea mulling leasing up to 60 F-16s] - Koreatimes.co.kr, 26 March 2014</ref>\n\n=== Taiwan ===\n[[File:Taiwan F-16 Debate - Flickr - Al Jazeera English (3).jpg|thumb|right|A F-16 fighter takes off from [[Chiayi Airbase]] in Southern Taiwan.]]\n\n[[Taiwan]] is a major F-16 customer, although it has placed only a single order for the aircraft.  In 1992, 150 F-16A/B-20 aircraft were ordered while at the same time Taiwan ordered 60 [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] and launched its own indigenous fighter program, the [[AIDC Ching-Kuo]].  Delivery of all F-16s was completed in 2001.\n\nTaiwan's foreign military sales program is known as PEACE FENGHUANG (Peace Phoenix).\n\nThe [[Republic of China Air Force]] (ROCAF), needing a next generation fighter to replace its fleet of [[Northrop F-5|F-5s]], has expressed interest in the new [[F-35 Lightning II]]. However, due to political issues, it is unlikely it will be able to acquire such an advanced fighter in the near future. As a result, the ROCAF has opted for up to 66 new F-16C/D Block50/52 as its interim replacement fighter.<ref name=\"Taiwan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/07/29/2003320879|title=US official confirms that Taipei requested fighters|work=taipeitimes.com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref> As with all military purchases, Beijing has expressed opposition to the sale.<ref>Ide, William.

With the evolution of sales under [[Foreign Military Sales]] (FMS) contracts, many other air forces have also acquired F-16s.  Most nations that have bought F-16s continue to use them as of 2010.\n\nThe F-16 is still in demand today, and many air forces are looking to replace aging inventories with F-16s.  Because the USAF has steadily upgraded its F-16 inventory, it will sometimes sell older aircraft it considers obsolete as [[military surplus|surplus]] Excess Defense Articles (EDAs) or as [[Complete knock down|\"knockdown\"]] aircraft to supplement [[Spare part|spares inventories]].\n\n== United States operators ==\n[[File:F-16 Fighting Falcons above New York City.jpg|thumb|[[USAF Air Demonstration Squadron|USAF Thunderbirds]] over [[New York City]]]]\n\nSeveral commands of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) as well as the [[United States Navy]] (USN) and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) use various models of the F-16 Fighting Falcon.\n\n=== United States Air Force ===\nThe USAF operates 1,245 F-16s with 701 with active forces, 490 with Air National Guard and 54 with Reserve.

ACC is the primary combat aircraft operator of the United States Air Force.  Originally, all new F-16s would be delivered to TAC or ACC and then transferred to other commands, but now aircraft are often delivered directly to the other commands.\n\n* [[20th Fighter Wing]] - [[Shaw Air Force Base|Shaw AFB]], [[South Carolina]]\n** [[55th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[77th Fighter Squadron]]\n** [[79th Fighter Squadron]]\n* [[53d Wing]] - [[Eglin Air Force Base|Eglin AFB]], [[Florida]]\n** [[85th Test and Evaluation Squadron]]\n** [[422d Test and Evaluation Squadron]], Nellis AFB, Nevada\n* [[57th Wing]] - [[Nellis Air Force Base|Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]]\n** [[64th Aggressor Squadron]]\n** [[United States Air Force Thunderbirds]]\n\n==== Air Education and Training Command ====\nThe [[USAF Air Education and Training Command|Air Education and Training Command]] (AETC) provides for most of the US Air Force's F-16 training facilities and operations.

Additionally, it operates overhaul programs to maintain the F-16 fleet of not only the US Air Force, but several foreign air forces as well.\n\n==== Air Force Reserve Command ====\nThe delivery of the F-16 to the [[Air Force Reserve Command]] (AFRC) marked the first aircraft type to be delivered new, changing the long policy of merely passing older airframes on from the active forces to the Air Force Reserve.

The lightweight F-16 was ideal for the job, and the F-16N version was specifically developed for the task.  With removal of the internal cannon (compensated by ballast), the F-16N and two-seat TF-16N served for a number of years before retirement.  The F-16 was reintroduced to the aggressor role for the US Navy with the acquisition of some of the Pakistani F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft embargoed before delivery to that country and they remain in use today at the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) at NAS Fallon, Nevada.  The US Navy operates 40 F-16s.<ref>[http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article24.html F-16 Users: US Navy], F-16.net.

Its fleet contains two exotic F-16 models (bailed from USAF), the [[F-16XL]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16 Advanced Fighter Technology Integration|F-16A AFTI]], both involved in researching advanced technologies for application to not only the F-16, but other aircraft as well.  Additionally, a number of standard F-16s have been operated by NASA as chase aircraft and engine testbeds.\n\n== Original NATO partners ==\nOnce selected by the United States, it was further decided to form a partnership between the [[United States Air Force]], then beginning development of the plane for service, and nations of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] alliance who had a similar need for a lightweight fighter.  Four such nations chose to join the development effort, and became part as well of the production and sub-contracting work to build the Fighting Falcon.  The four European partners, collectively known as the European Participating Governments (EPG), are [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]], and [[Norway]]; their air forces are likewise referred to as the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF).\n\n<div align=center>\n<gallery>\nFile:General Dynamics F-16AM Fighting Falcon, Belgium - Air Force JP6689918.jpg|Belgium\nFile:F-16 (5167369409).jpg|Denmark\nFile:General Dynamics F-16AM Fighting Falcon, Netherlands - Royal Air Force JP7401086.jpg|Netherlands\nFile:General Dynamics (Fokker) F-16AM Fighting Falcon (401), Norway - Air Force AN0636300.jpg|Norway\n</gallery>\n</div>\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Belgian Air Component|Belgium]] was the largest initial buyer of the F-16 of the four original NATO partners, and Belgium's aeronautical company SABCA was a primary producer of the aircraft as part of the partnership. Belgium's initial order brought delivery of 116 F-16A/B aircraft in blocks 1, 5, 10, and 15, beginning in 1979, and was completed in 1985.  A follow-on order for 44 F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft was completed in 1991. Most of the Danish F-16s were also manufactured in Belgium. Many of the Belgian and Danish F-16s received the MLU update at SABCA.\n\n=== Denmark ===\n[[Denmark]] was the smallest member of the NATO partnership, with the [[Royal Danish Air Force]] accepting 58 F-16A/B aircraft under Denmark's initial order.{{when|date=May 2014}} A small follow-on order brought a further twelve aircraft to Denmark, and two further attrition replacement orders were later placed, resulting in a total of 62 F-16AM and 16 F-16BM that entered Danish service.<ref>{{cite web |title=All-Time Aircraft Used List Royal Danish Air Force |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/user/every/denmark-af-all-time-aircraft-used-list.htm |website=Aeroflight |accessdate=27 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:F-16 Demo Team 2722.jpg|thumb|right|A Dutch F-16 in a special orange livery for air displays]]\n\nThe [[Netherlands]], like Belgium, made substantial orders for the F-16, and built aircraft at the [[Fokker]] plant. Deliveries started in 1979 and ended in 1992. A total of 102 aircraft were initially ordered, but these were followed by substantial follow-on orders for a total of 111 additional aircraft. 52 of these were F-16A/B-15OCU aircraft. These orders brought total Dutch F-16A/B deliveries to 213. 108 of them received the [[F-16 mid-life update|Mid-Life-Update (MLU)]].\n\n=== Norway ===\n[[Norway]] joined the original NATO-USAF partnership to replace its ageing [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] squadrons.  In 1975, Norway placed an order for 72 F-16A/B aircraft, delivered between 1980 and 1984. Unlike the other partners, there have been no follow-up orders, except for a single order in 1989 for two F-16B-15OCU aircraft as replacements for crashed aircraft. All the aircraft have received the [[F-16 mid-life update|Mid-Life-Update (MLU)]], and they received the new, helmet-mounted sighting system.\n\n== Europe ==\n=== Greece ===\n[[File:HAF F-16D Block 52.jpg|thumb|right|An F-16D Block 52+ of the [[Hellenic Air Force]] with [[Conformal fuel tank|Conformal Fuel Tanks]]]]\n\nAfter protracted negotiations the [[Hellenic Air Force]] ordered the F-16 in 1985. FMS program PEACE XENIA was begun with delivery of 40 F-16C/D Block 30 aircraft in 1989 and 1990.  This was followed by an order for 40 F-16C/D Block 50 fighters, delivered in 1997 and 1998. In June 2000 a further order for 50 F-16C/D Block 52+ aircraft was made with an option of 10 more fighters, exercised in September 2001. All 60 aircraft (40 C-model aircraft and 20 missionized D-model) were delivered by June 2004. In December 2005 the Greek government signed an LOA for the delivery of 30 additional F-16C/D Block 52M with a not exercised option on 10 more. The latest batch consists of 20 C-models and 10 D-models, while deliveries were completed in 2009.

In the meantime, 24 [[Panavia Tornado ADV]] jets from the [[United Kingdom]] were leased to cover the gap. This lease ran out in 2003, without the Typhoon being ready for service. The solution was provided by a five-year lease of 34 F-16 aircraft with an option to extend the lease for another five years. 30 aircraft were F-16A/B-15ADF while the remaining four aircraft were earlier block aircraft for spares. These were all used U.S. Air Force fighters.\n\nIn June 2010, the Italian Air Force started the return of the F-16s to the United States which was completed on 23 May 2012, when all the Italian F-16 were returned to the USA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/news_article4581.html|title=Italian F-16 'Peace Caesar' program comes to an end|work=f-16.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Italian Foreign Military Sales program was known as PEACE CAESAR.\n\n=== Poland ===\n[[File:4061 an F-16C of the Polish Air Forces 31 BLT (4543635562).jpg|thumb|Polish F-16C]]\n\nOne of the former members of the [[Warsaw Pact]] that was looking to replace an aging fleet of Soviet-built [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] (withdrawn in service in 1999 due to their small numbers and uneconomical operation) and the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]] fighters (withdrawn from service in 2003), [[Poland]] conducted a competition between the [[Dassault Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5 Mk.2]], the [[JAS 39 Gripen]], the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29]] (the last offer was withdrawn), and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. Despite a strong challenge by the BAe/SAAB team, Poland purchased 48 F-16C/D-52+ aircraft. The aircraft were delivered from 2006 under the PEACE SKY program, to avoid confusion with the [[PZL W-3 Sok\u00f3\u0142]] ([[Polish language]] \"Falcon\") helicopter, these jet fighters were nicknamed the F-16 ''Jastrz\u0105b'' ([[wiktionary:goshawk|Goshawk]]) in Polish.

The funds used for the purchase were made available through the [[Foreign Military Sales]] program, partly a payment for the use by the United States of [[Lajes Air Base]] in the [[Azores]]. Initially the United States  proposed to supply Portugal with Block 10 surplus aircraft. However this option rested on a first order of 20 newly built [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon variants#F-16A/B Block 15 OCU|F-16 Block 15 OCU]] (17 A-models and three B-models) with [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] engines, which made them almost identical to the [[Air National Guard|US Air National Guard]]'s F-16 ADF. Deliveries of this first order began on February 18, 1994, and was completed on July 18 in the same year.\n\nThe initial group of Portuguese F-16 pilots was constituted by [[Fighter aircraft|fighter pilots]] from the [[302 Squadron (Portugal)|302]] and [[304 Squadron (Portugal)|304 Squadron]]s, received training in [[Tucson, Arizona]], between January and June 1994.\n\nDuring the [[War in Kosovo]], it was seen that while the Portuguese F-16s were recently obtained, they were no longer up to the same level as most modern fighters used by other NATO countries. In 1999, during the Portuguese participation in the conflict ([[Operation Allied Force]]), the three F-16 fighters deployed by Portugal were relegated to escort missions and combat air patrols due to their lack of modern armament and air-to-ground targeting systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n==== Peace Atlantis II ====\nDuring 1996, during the government of then-[[Prime Minister]] [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], new negotiations took place concerning the possible purchase of new of F-16 fighters and the modernization those aircraft. The Pentagon approved of the deal on November 20, 1997, and on November 30, 1998, Portugal signed the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LoA) for 25 second-hand F - 16 Block 15 (21 A and four B) that had been used by the [[U.S. Air National Guard]]. Under the program these would be offered by the United States at zero cost and free of charge as Excess Defense Articles under the Southern Regional Amendment to the Arms Export and Control Act, with Portugal being responsible for their transportation to Europe and for the modernization costs.\n\nIncluded in the LoA and in the Peace Atlantis II program was also the purchase of new [[Pratt & Whitney F100|Pratt & Whitney F100-PW-220E]] engines, 20 upgrade kits, logistics support and training.\n\nInitially, the plan consisted in only upgrading the second-hand aircraft of the Peace Atlantis II program and of transferring the F-16s from the Peace Atlantis I to a second squadron with the mission of performing tactical air support actions and tactical air support for maritime operations (TASMO), which wouldn't require the MLU kit.\n\nOf the second-hand F-16s, five of the airframes were used as spare parts, and only the remaining 20 F-16s were intended for upgrade for day & night all-weather operations, by receiving the Falcon UP structural upgrade, the F100-PW-220E engine upgrade and the Mid-Life update (MLU) avionics and cockpit upgrade, to equip the [[301 Squadron (Portugal)|301 Squadron]].\n\n==== Current status ====\nThe [[F-16AM|Mid-Life upgrade]] (MLU) was performed in Portugal by the Air Force's workshops at Monte Real and by [[OGMA]] in Alverca. In 2001, employees of the LMTAS modified the first two aircraft in a Lead-the-Fleet program, with Portuguese technicians observing. The first F-16 AM was delivered on June 2003, and the PoAF personnel performed the modification of the remaining 18 aircraft.\n\nCurrently the Portuguese F-16 fleet uses the AN/ALQ-131 ECM pods, that had originally been bought for the A-7P Corsair IIs, and the new [[LITENING targeting pod|Rafael LITENING II targeting pods]].

In part to reward Israel for its restraint during the [[Gulf War]], a shipment of 50 US-surplus F-16As and F-16Bs were delivered in 1994.\n\nIn a deal worth $4.5 billion, Israel also ordered 102 additional block 52+ F-16Ds, designated the F-16I nicknamed \"Sufa\" (Storm). Deliveries of these took place between 2004 and 2009.<ref>[http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article7.html ]. F-16.net</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Israel began a program called ''Teuza'' (boldness) for the purpose of turning some military bases into sales lots for obsolete IDF equipment.  Older models that are not suited for Israel's modern high-tech forces will be sold off, or sold for scrap if there are no buyers.  Old-model F-16 jets are among those being offered.  Main buyers are expected from Latin American, Asian, and African countries.<ref>[http://www.armyrecognition.com/july_2013_news_defence_security_industry_military/israeli_army_is_planning_to_sell_second-hands_merkava_main_battle_tanks_f-16_fighter_aircraft_160713.html Israeli army is planning to sell second-hands Merkava main battle tanks and F-16 fighter aircraft] - Armyrecognition.com, 16 July 2013</ref> Later that month, Major General [[Amir Eshel]] ordered the immediate shutdown of two squadrons of F-16A/B fighters, without any advance warning to the squadrons' air and ground crews.

Jordan then arranged for a lease of air defense F-16s from the United States, and to transfer ownership eventually.

This agreement, formally signed by Field Marshal Marei, chief of staff of the Royal Jordanian Armed Forces and Major General Ababneh, chief of staff of the Royal Jordanian Air Force, was linked to the Middle East peace process and close US-Jordanian relations. The complete material/training support agreement, known as the F-16 Peace Falcon Program, includes funding for aircraft structural upgrades, engine modifications, support equipment and spare parts procurement, and pilot/maintenance training.\n\nThe agreement consisted of two lease contracts and a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LoA). The first lease was a no-cost lease for Jordan, covering 13 aircraft (12 A models and 1 B model, block 15 OCUs that were modified into ADF (Air Defense Fighters) versions. Under the Arms Export Control Act, the DOD was able to provide these aircraft at a no-cost lease because they had flown off over 75 percent of their life (i.e. more than 3,000 hour). Three of the B-model aircraft still had more than 25 percent of their life left and they fall under the second $4.5 million lease. Both leases cover a 5-year period. The LOA is for $215 million, covering all costs associated with upgrading those aircraft, doing the structural modifications to them, the engine upgrades, providing the support equipment, the logistics, the training.\n\nThe aircraft, all of which have flown previously by active Air Force and Air National Guard units, had been in storage for at least a year at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) at Davis-Monthan AFB, Tucson, Arizona before they were shipped to Hill AFB, Utah. There the Aircraft Directorate personnel from the Ogden Air Logistics Center performed structural upgrades to extend aircraft life from the designed 4,000 to 8,000 hours flying time as part of the Falcon-Up/Service Life Improvement program. They also modified the aircraft engine bay to accept the upgraded Pratt and Whitney F100-220E engine. New ground was broken with this Foreign military Sales program: taking 'used' F-16s from the desert (AMARC), completely refurbishing and modifying them and delivering the aircraft to the customer within a 17-month time frame.\n\nOn October 14, 1997 Lt. Col. Scott Curtis, flying safety officer at Hill AFB, pushed the throttles forward and released the brakes on his F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft. Within a matter of seconds the aircraft accelerated to 140 knots and the first Jordanian F-16 (tail number #80-0547) was airborne. It took more than 13,000 man-hours to get this F-16 ready for its first flight. The #80-0547 had not flown since November 1994, when it was flown from the ANG Station in Garden City, N.J. to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, Davis-Monthan, Arizona. The official roll-out of the Peace Falcon was on October 28, 1997, on Hill AFB, Utah.\n\nThe Jordan program required that six aircraft be available for ferry flight delivery to Jordan in December 1997, and five each to be available for ferry flight in January and February 1998. At that time, the RJAF planned to acquire as much as 60-70 F-16s (if possible C/D models), enough to equip 3 squadrons.\n\n==== Peace Falcon II ====\n\nThere have been talks about a second batch of 16 refurbished F-16s, which would have been delivered under the Peace Falcon II program. After initial talks in 1999, no further news has become available about this program. The RJAF is still looking for a replacement for its obsolete F-5 fighters which are due within a couple of years. They are in favor of acquiring another batch of F-16s for this replacement.\n\nOn January 29, 2003, numerous sources indicated that Jordan received 6 F-16 fighters that day in a ceremony held at Shahid Muafaq Al-Satlti AFB. This ceremony was attended by prince Faisal bin Hussain and US ambassador Jordan Edward W. Gnehm. The US embassy in Amman stated that these 6 aircraft were the first of a batch of another 17 (12 F-16As and 5 F-16Bs) that would be delivered to Jordan during the year 2003. All these aircraft are former US ANG F-16 ADFs. These aircraft are to be upgraded with the MLU modification (See Modifications and Armament).\n\nUltimately, 16 A-models and 1 B-model was delivered to the RJAF. Most of those airframes were put into storage waiting for their MLU conversion. In 2008 these modifications were in full swing at the TUSAS facility in Ankara, Turkey. By 2009 all of those modified airframes will be delivered back to Jordan for operational use.\n\n==== Peace Falcon III ====\n\nIn 2005 the RJAF contacted the Dutch and Belgian governments for a batch of F-16s. In April 2006 representatives of both air forces flew to Amman to sign a Letter of Intent for the acquisition of up to 22 ex-Dutch (8 airframes) and ex-Belgian (14 airframes) F-16s. The lot would consist of 17 A-models and 5 B-models (Netherlands: 5 A-models, 3 B-models; Belgium: 12 A-models, 2 B-models). All these aircraft have undergone the MLU upgrade which gives the Jordanians a serious boost in air power and also a sneak preview of the possibilities they will gain after their entire fleet is upgraded with this package. The aircraft are due to be delivered in 2007\u20132008.\n\nIn 2009 a total of 16 Belgian F-16s (12 As and 4 Bs) were delivered, but the Dutch order for A-models was canceled. By that time it became apparent that only the 3 B-models of the first purchase from the Netherlands and the 3 B-models included in the second purchase would be handed over to Jordan during 2009 as part of Peace Falcon IV.\n\n==== Peace Falcon IV ====\n\nThe Dutch Secretary of Defence announced at the Dubai Air Show in November 2005 that he had signed a Letter of Intent for the purchase of 3 F-16Bs by the RJAF. The aircraft were to be used as training assets and are due for delivery in 2006.\n\nIn the end, the number of F-16BMs was raised to 6. The delivery of those was postponed until the summer of 2009.\n\n==== Peace Falcon V ====\n\nIn 2009 the Belgian government decided to put another 9 F-16AMs for sale. The first country to respond was Jordan and negotiations have been ongoing till 2011. Finally the delivery consisted of 6 F-16AMs and 3 F-16BMs, all delivered in July 2011. The number of Jordanian F-16s rises to 64 airframes with this delivery.\n\nOn 24 December 2014, a Jordanian F-16 crashed in Syria after being allegedly shot down by ISIS.

Deliveries of the F-16A/Bs are expected to begin in 2007, while the initial F-16C/Ds will likely be received sometime in late 2008 or early 2009.  The current procurement program of new-built aircraft as well as refurbishment and upgrade of 60 used and serving aircraft is expected to be complete by 2010\u20132012, as per the [[Pakistan Air Force]] [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Tanvir Mahmood Ahmed]].  In April 2006, ''[[Janes Defence Weekly]]'' reported that the PAF may procure an additional 18 Block 52 from the current deal. In July 2007, Commander of [[United States Central Command Air Forces|Central Command Air Forces]], [[Lieutenant General]] [[Gary L.

It has operated the aircraft since 1988, when the first of its initial order for 8 F-16A/B-15OCU arrived.  Since then, it has begun ordering multiple installments of F-16C/D Block 52/52+ aircraft, totalling 74 of the advanced fighters.

A more ambitious program (Korean Fighter Program)  to provide 120 new fighters was initially lost to the [[F/A-18 Hornet]], but various difficulties led to the order going to the F-16C/D Block 52D (KF-16C/D), 72 of which were to be manufactured in South Korea, 36 of which were to be delivered in kit form and assembled in South Korea, and 12 of which were to be produced in Fort Worth, U.S.A..  In 2000, a further 20 Korean-built F-16s were added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f-16.net/f-16_users_article18.html|title=F-16 Air Forces - South Korea|work=f-16.net|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe South Korean Foreign Military Sales program is known as PEACE BRIDGE.\n\nIn May 2009, South Korean government announced upgrade plan for its KF-16C/D fleet's radar and armament, as part of the 2010-2014 arms acquisition and management package being submitted to President Lee Myung-bak for approval. The ROKAF operates about 135 of the \u201cKF-16\u201d fighters, many of which were built in Korea under a $5.5 billion licensing agreement from 1994\u20132004. Key upgrades will include new radars to replace the existing APG-68v5/v7 systems, avionics and computers, and improving cabling and databuses to MIL-STD-1760 so that the aircraft will be able to carry GPS-guided weapons, AIM-9X Sidewider missiles, and other new equipment.\n\nIn March 2014, the South Korean Air Force revealed that it was considering leasing F-16s operated by the U.S. Air Force.  ROKAF F-4 and F-5 fighters were intended to be replaced through the [[F-X fighter program#F-X Phase 3|F-X III]] competition by 2016 and the development of the [[KAI KF-X|KF-X]] indigenous fighter, but F-X III deliveries were delayed until 2018 and the KF-X won't enter service until 2023.  With the aging fighters still needing to be retired, between 20 and 60 American F-16s are being reviewed for leasing to sustain aircraft numbers.  South Korea had previously leased U.S. [[T-38 Talon]] trainers for over a decade until the completion of the [[KAI T-50 Golden Eagle]], but a country leasing a combat fighter is very rare due to risk of increased costs if they need to be used in a conflict situation.<ref>[http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2014/03/116_154126.html Korea mulling leasing up to 60 F-16s] - Koreatimes.co.kr, 26 March 2014</ref>\n\n=== Taiwan ===\n[[File:Taiwan F-16 Debate - Flickr - Al Jazeera English (3).jpg|thumb|right|A F-16 fighter takes off from [[Chiayi Airbase]] in Southern Taiwan.]]\n\n[[Taiwan]] is a major F-16 customer, although it has placed only a single order for the aircraft.  In 1992, 150 F-16A/B-20 aircraft were ordered while at the same time Taiwan ordered 60 [[Dassault Mirage 2000]] and launched its own indigenous fighter program, the [[AIDC Ching-Kuo]].  Delivery of all F-16s was completed in 2001.\n\nTaiwan's foreign military sales program is known as PEACE FENGHUANG (Peace Phoenix).\n\nThe [[Republic of China Air Force]] (ROCAF), needing a next generation fighter to replace its fleet of [[Northrop F-5|F-5s]], has expressed interest in the new [[F-35 Lightning II]]. However, due to political issues, it is unlikely it will be able to acquire such an advanced fighter in the near future. As a result, the ROCAF has opted for up to 66 new F-16C/D Block50/52 as its interim replacement fighter.<ref name=\"Taiwan\">{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/07/29/2003320879|title=US official confirms that Taipei requested fighters|work=taipeitimes.com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}</ref> As with all military purchases, Beijing has expressed opposition to the sale.<ref>Ide, William.
