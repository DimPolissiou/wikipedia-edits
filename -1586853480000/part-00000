She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535.

The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\n===Wedding preparations===\nThe artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[D\u00fcren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The two versions of Holbein's portrait are in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], \"Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her\".{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836\u2013837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.\n\nHenry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n\n<blockquote>[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year\u2019s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window\u2026. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet.

Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 146]}}\n\nMost historians believe that he later used as excuses Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage, saying he felt he had been misled, for everyone had praised Anne's attractions: \"She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported\", he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some of the blame for the portrait by Holbein which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans.

The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns.

Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010).

In March 1539, negotiations for Anne's marriage to Henry began, as Henry believed that he needed to form a political alliance with her brother, [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]], who was a leader of the Protestants of western Germany, to strengthen his position against potential attacks from Catholic France and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>http://blog.english-heritage.org.uk/henry-viii-and-anne-of-cleves/</ref>\n\nAnne arrived in England on 27 December 1539 and married Henry on 6 January 1540. However, after six months, the marriage was declared [[unconsummated]] and, as a result, she was not crowned [[queen consort]].

She grew up in [[Schloss Burg (Solingen)|Schloss Burg]] on the edge of [[Solingen]].\n\nAnne's father was influenced by [[Erasmus]] and followed a moderate path within the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].  He sided with the [[Schmalkaldic League]] and opposed [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]. After John's death, Anne's brother [[Wilhelm, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|William]] became [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg]], bearing the promising epithet \"The Rich\". In 1526, her elder sister [[Sibylle of Cleves|Sibylle]] was married to [[John Frederick, Elector of Saxony]], head of the [[Schmalkaldic League|Protestant Confederation of Germany]] and considered the \"Champion of the Reformation\".\n\nAt the age of 11 (1527), Anne was betrothed to [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine|Francis]], son and heir of [[Antoine, Duke of Lorraine]] while he was only 10.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=12\u201313}} Thus the betrothal was considered unofficial and was cancelled in 1535. Her brother William was a [[Lutheran]] but the family was unaligned religiously, with her mother, the Duchess Maria, described as a \"strict Catholic\".{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT369&lpg=PT369#v=onepage&q&f=false 364]}} The Duke's ongoing dispute over [[Guelders|Gelderland]] with Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] made them suitable allies for England's King Henry VIII in the wake of the [[Truce of Nice]]. The match with Anne was urged on the King by his chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]].\n\n===Wedding preparations===\nThe artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was dispatched to [[D\u00fcren]] to paint portraits of Anne and her younger sister, [[Amalia of Cleves|Amalia]], each of whom Henry was considering as his fourth wife. Henry required the artist to be as accurate as possible, not to flatter the sisters. The two versions of Holbein's portrait are in the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris and the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London.

Cromwell oversaw the talks and a marriage treaty was signed on 4 October of that year.\n\nHenry valued education and cultural sophistication in women, but Anne lacked these.  She had received no formal education but was skilled in needlework and liked playing card games. She could read and write, but only in German.{{sfn|Norton|2010|pp=10\u201311}} Nevertheless, Anne was considered gentle, virtuous and docile, which is why she was recommended as a suitable candidate for Henry.\n\nAnne was described by the French ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], as tall and slim, \"of middling beauty and of very assured and resolute countenance\".{{sfn|Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII 15: 1540 no. 22}} She was fair haired and was said to have had a lovely face. In the words of the chronicler [[Edward Hall]], \"Her hair hanging down, which was fair, yellow and long ... she was apparelled after the English fashion, with a French hood, which so set forth her beauty and good visage, that every creature rejoiced to behold her\".{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=836\u2013837}} She appeared rather solemn by English standards, and looked old for her age. Holbein painted her with high forehead, heavy-lidded eyes and a pointed chin.\n\nHenry met her privately on New Year's Day 1540 at Rochester Abbey in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] on her journey from [[Dover]].{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} Henry and some of his courtiers, following a courtly-love tradition, went disguised into the room where Anne was staying.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}} [[Eustace Chapuys]] reported:\n{{Wives of Henry VIII}}\n\n<blockquote>[The King] so went up into the chamber where the said Lady Anne was looking out of a window to see the bull-baiting which was going on in the courtyard, and suddenly he embraced and kissed her, and showed her a token which the king had sent her for New Year\u2019s gift, and she being abashed and not knowing who it was thanked him, and so he spoke with her. But she regarded him little, but always looked out the window\u2026. and when the king saw that she took so little notice of his coming he went into another chamber and took off his cloak and came in again in a coat of purple velvet. And when the lords and knights saw his grace they did him reverence.<ref>[https://thehistoryjar.com/2017/01/06/anne-of-cleves-not-love-at-first-sight/ \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Not Love at First Sight\" ''The History Jar''] retrieved February 6, 2017</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the testimony of his companions, he was disappointed with Anne, feeling she was not as described. According to the chronicler [[Charles Wriothesley]], Anne \"regarded him little\",{{sfn|Wriothesley|1875|pp=109\u2013110}} though it is unknown whether she knew this was the king.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA132#v=onepage&q&f=false 132]}} Henry did then reveal his true identity to Anne, although he is said to have been put off the marriage from then on. Henry and Anne then met officially on 3 January on Blackheath outside the gates of Greenwich Park, where a grand reception was laid out.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 146]}}\n\nMost historians believe that he later used as excuses Anne's alleged unsatisfactory appearance and failure to inspire him to consummate the marriage, saying he felt he had been misled, for everyone had praised Anne's attractions: \"She is nothing so fair as she hath been reported\", he complained.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=361}} Cromwell received some of the blame for the portrait by Holbein which Henry believed had not been an accurate representation of Anne and for some of the exaggerated reports of her beauty. When the king finally met Anne, he was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance, and the marriage was never consummated.{{sfn|Elton|1991|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIktfDyZ3VAhXG7IMKHb-cCXM4ChDoAQgtMAE#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20downfall&f=false 157]}}{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=P1PrjR79wzgC&pg=PA77&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+Duchess+of+Milan+%22as+the+golden+sun+did+the+silver&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjz1ZC0z53VAhUN0IMKHWSfAnkQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=cromwell%20anne%20of%20cleves%20Duchess%20of%20Milan%20%22as%20the%20golden%20sun%20did%20the%20silver&f=false 77]}}\n\nHenry urged Cromwell to find a legal way to avoid the marriage but, by this point, doing so was impossible without endangering the vital alliance with the Germans. In his anger and frustration the King finally turned on Cromwell, to his subsequent regret.{{sfn|Lehmberg|1977|p=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=MhY9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA127&dq=Henry+VIII+execution+of+cromwell+later+regretted&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH8P_L0Z3VAhVJ44MKHdxECwQQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Henry%20VIII%20execution%20of%20cromwell%20later%20regretted&f=false 127]}}\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bruyn Anne of Cleves.jpg|right|thumb|A portrait of Anne in the 1540s by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder|Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the elder]].]]\n\nDespite Henry's very vocal misgivings, the two were married on 6 January 1540 at the royal [[Palace of Placentia]] in [[Greenwich]], London, by [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishop]] [[Thomas Cranmer]]. The phrase \"God send me well to keep\" was engraved around Anne's wedding ring.

Witness statements were taken from a number of courtiers and two physicians which register the king's disappointment at her appearance. Henry had also commented to [[Groom of the Stool#Grooms of the Stool under Henry VIII|Thomas Heneage and Anthony Denny]] that he could not believe she was a virgin.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/450/mode/2up 450\u2013463]}}\n\nShortly afterwards, Anne was asked for her consent to an annulment, to which she agreed.  Cromwell, the moving force behind the marriage, was [[attainder|attainted]] for [[treason]]. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1540, on the grounds of non-consummation and her pre-contract to Francis of Lorraine. Henry VIII's physician stated that after the wedding night, Henry said he was not impotent because he experienced \"''{{lang|la|duas pollutiones nocturnas in somno}}''\" (two [[nocturnal emission|nocturnal pollutions]] while in sleep; i.e., two [[wet dream]]s).{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/460/mode/2up 461]}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Holbein en Angleterre |work=Amateur d'Art, par Lunettes Rouge |date=29 November 2006 |publisher=[[Le Monde|La Vie\u2013Le Monde Group]] |url=http://lunettesrouges.blog.lemonde.fr/2006/11/29/holbein-en-angleterre/ |accessdate=4 January 2014 |language=fr }}.</ref>\n\n==After the annulment==\n[[File:Coat of Arms of Anne of Cleves.svg|thumb|250px|Anne of Cleves' arms as queen consort.{{sfn|Boutell|1863|p=243}}]]\n\nThe former queen received a generous [[legal settlement|settlement]], including [[Richmond Palace]], and [[Hever Castle]], home of Henry's former in-laws, the Boleyns.

According to [[Simon Renard]], the imperial ambassador, Anne's close association with Elizabeth had convinced the Queen that \"the Lady [Anne] of Cleves was of the plot and intrigued with the Duke of Cleves to obtain help for Elizabeth: matters in which the king of France was the prime mover\".{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=151}} There is no evidence that Anne was invited back to court after 1554.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} She was compelled to live a quiet and obscure life on her estates.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=154}} After her arrival as the King's bride, Anne never left England. Despite occasional feelings of homesickness, Anne was generally content in England and was described by [[Raphael Holinshed|Holinshed]] as \"a ladie of right commendable regards, courteous, gentle, a good housekeeper and verie bountifull to her servants.\"{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}}\n\n==Death==\nWhen Anne's health began to fail, Mary allowed her to live at [[Chelsea Manor|Chelsea Old Manor]], where Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], had lived after her remarriage.{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT507#v=onepage&q&f=false 504]}} Here, in the middle of July 1557, Anne dictated her last will.

The most likely cause of her death was [[cancer]].{{sfn|Fraser|1992|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HKynDn8DnhEC&pg=PT507#v=onepage&q&f=false 504]}} She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], on 3&nbsp;August,{{sfn|Machyn|1968|pp=145\u2013146}} in what has been described as a \"somewhat hard to find tomb\" on the opposite side of [[Edward the Confessor]]'s shrine and slightly above eye level for a person of average height. She is the only wife of Henry VIII to be buried in the Abbey.\n\nAnne's [[epitaph]] in Westminster Abbey, which is in English, reads simply:<ref>Google Images</ref>\n\n<center>ANNE OF CLEVES</center>\n<center>QUEEN OF ENGLAND</center>\n<center>BORN 1515 * DIED 1557</center>\n\nShe also has the distinction of being the last of Henry VIII's wives to die,{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=165}} as she outlived Henry's last wife, [[Catherine Parr]], by 9 years. She was not the longest-lived, however, since [[Catherine of Aragon]] was 50 at the time of her death.{{sfn|Norton|2010|p=161}}\n\n==Literature==\nAnne is the subject of four biographies: Julia Hamilton's ''Anne of Cleves'' (1972), and Mary Saaler's ''Anne of Cleves: Fourth Wife of Henry VIII'' (1995), [[Elizabeth Norton]]'s ''Anne of Cleves: Henry VIII's Discarded Bride'' (2009), and Heather Darsie's ''Anna, Duchess of Cleves: The King's Beloved Sister'' (2019). Retha Warnicke has written an academic study on Anne's marriage called ''The Marrying of Anne of Cleves. Royal Protocol in Early Modern England'' (2000).\n\nAnne of Cleves appears as a character in many historical novels about Henry's reign. In ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' (1906) by [[Ford Madox Ford]] she is portrayed as a sensible, practical woman who happily settles for  an annulment in return for  the material benefits it brings. Anne of Cleves is the main character of ''My Lady of Cleves'' (1946) by [[Margaret Campbell Barnes]]. About a third of ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]'' (2006) by [[Philippa Gregory]] is recounted from Anne's point of view, covering the period of Henry VIII's marriages to her and to her successor Catherine Howard. The book concludes with Anne living away from court, and avoiding the execution ceremonies of Howard and of [[Jane Boleyn]], sister-in-law to one of Henry's queens and lady-in-waiting to five of the others, including Anne. Gregory includes Anne in a non-fictional review of the period at the end of the book.\n\nAnne and her Holbein portrait in the Louvre are the focus of the novel ''Amenable Women'' (2009) by [[Mavis Cheek]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Annis |title=Amenable Women by Mavis Cheek |work=HistoricalNovels.info |url=http://www.historicalnovels.info/Amenable-Women.html |accessdate=2 April 2012 }}; {{cite web|title=Amenable Women, Mavis Cheek |work=Faber & Faber |url=http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |accessdate=2 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515022239/http://www.faber.co.uk/work/amenable-women/9780571238965/ |archivedate=15 May 2009 }}</ref> Anne and Catherine Howard are the subject of ''The Queen's Mistake'' by Diane Haeger (2009), while Anne and Jane Seymour are covered in Volume 3 of Dixie Atkins's tetralogy ''A Golden Sorrow'' (2010). D. Lawrence-Young authored a [[biographical novel]] \"Anne of Cleves \u2013 Henry's Luckiest Wife\" published by GMTA/Celestial Press. N.C. USA, 2013.\n\nIn May 2019 [[Alison Weir]] released her fourth Six Tudor Queens Novel, ''Anna of Kleve: Queen of Secrets.'' The novel follows her throughout her life, first in Germany then Tudor England.\n\n==In film and television==\nThe role of Anne of Cleves was played by:\n* [[Elsa Lanchester]] in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'', which was released in 1933. Lanchester's husband [[Charles Laughton]] played Henry VIII and won an Academy Award for his portrayal.<ref>{{Allmovie title|39313|The Private Life of Henry VIII}}</ref>\n* [[Elvi Hale]] in the episode ''Anne of Cleves'' in the 1971 television series ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/sixwivesof.htm |title=Six Wives of Henry VII, The |website=Encyclopedia of Television |publisher=Museum of Broadcast Communications |access-date=2019-01-03 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This series portrays Anne as a personally naive yet politically clever woman who convinces Henry against consummating the union so that he can get out of his alliance with the Germans should the need arise.

The series also has an anachronistically svelte Henry engaging in an affair with Anne after his marriage to Catherine Howard, realizing too late that he \"like[s] her after all.\"\n* Alexia McIntosh portrays a hilariously confident Cleves in ''[[Six (musical)|Six]]'' the Musical on the West End, emphasizing her life after her marriage to Henry, as well as the money and power she acquired after their annulment.

Active in both the [[Netherlands]] and Hollywood, Verhoeven's blending of graphic violence and sexual content with social satire are trademarks of both his [[Drama film|drama]] and [[science fiction film]]s. He directed the films ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' (1973), ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' (1977), ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983), ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) and ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' (2016).\n\n''Turkish Delight'' received the award for Best Dutch Film of the Century at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/films/turks-fruit |title=Turks fruit |work=[[Netherlands Film Festival]] |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> His films altogether received a total of nine [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, mainly for editing and effects. Verhoeven won the [[Saturn Award for Best Director]] for ''RoboCop''. His Dutch war film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] and was voted by the Dutch public, in 2008, as the best Dutch film ever made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |title=Zwartboek beste film aller tijden |trans-title=Black Book: best film of all time |language=Dutch |work=Cinema.nl |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164057/http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In contrast, he won the [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for ''Showgirls''; he is one of the few people to have [[List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards|accepted their Golden Raspberry awards]] in person, and was the first person to go to the ceremony to receive it.

His family lived in the village of [[Slikkerveer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1943 the family moved to [[The Hague]], the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with [[V-weapons|V1 and V2-rocket launchers]], which was repeatedly bombed by Allied forces. Their neighbours' house was hit and Verhoeven's parents were almost killed when bombs fell on a street crossing. From this period, Verhoeven mentioned in interviews, he remembers images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger. As a small child he experienced the war as an exciting adventure and compares himself with the character Bill Rowan in ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"oorlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/verhoeven/verhoeven_deel_1.htm|title=Een beetje oorlog, best spannend|trans-title=A little war, quite exciting|work=De cinema van Paul Verhoeven: voorbij de controverse|first=Rob |last=Testelmans|year=2003|accessdate=17 October 2006|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's father became head teacher at the [[Van Heutszschool]] in The Hague, and Paul attended this school. Sometimes they watched informative films at home with the school's [[Movie projector|film projector]]. Verhoeven and his father also liked to see American films that were in the cinema after the liberation, such as ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThey went ten times to see ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953). Verhoeven was a fan of the Dutch comic ''[[Dick Bos]]'' ([[:nl:Dick Bos|nl]]). The character Dick Bos is a private detective who fights crime using [[jujutsu]]. Verhoeven liked comic drawing; he created ''The Killer'', a character in a detailed story of revenge. Other fiction he liked were ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] [[Barsoom]] series.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nVerhoeven attended public secondary school [[Gymnasium Haganum]] in The Hague. Later, beginning in 1955, he studied at [[Leiden University]], where he joined the elite fraternity ''Minerva''. Verhoeven graduated with a [[doctorandus]] (MSc) with a double major, in Mathematics and [[Physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|title=What's new?|work=paulverhoeven.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220013620/http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|archivedate=20 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20060913/paul-verhoeven|title=Paul Verhoeven profile|work=Wiskundemeisjes.nl|accessdate=3 February 2017|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Short films and TV series (1960\u20131969)===\nVerhoeven made his first film ''A Lizzard Too Much'' for the anniversary of his [[Student Corps|students' corps]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |title=Paul Verhoeven: Biography |work=gonemovies.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129125642/http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> In his last years at university Verhoeven also attended classes at the [[Netherlands Film and Television Academy|Netherlands Film Academy]]. After this he made three more short films: ''Nothing Special'' (1961), ''The Hitchhikers'' (1962), and ''Let's Have a Party'' (1963).\n\nVerhoeven has not used his mathematics and physics degree, opting instead to invest his energies in a career in film. After his studies he entered the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] as a conscript. He made the documentary ''Het Korps Mariniers'' (\"''The Marine Corps''\", 1965), which won the French ''Golden Sun'' award for military films.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Verhoeven married Martine Tours, with whom he later had two daughters, Claudia (b. 1972), and Helen (b. 1974).\n\nWhen he left the Navy, Verhoeven took his skills to Dutch television. First, he made a documentary about [[Anton Mussert]] named ''Mussert'' (1968). His first major success was the 1969 ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'' television series, starring [[Rutger Hauer]]. The concept of ''Floris'' was inspired by foreign series like ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' and ''[[Thierry La Fronde]]''.\n\n===First feature films (1969\u20131983)===\nVerhoeven's first feature film ''[[Business Is Business (film)|Business Is Business]]'' was released in 1971 and was not well received. His first national success came in 1973 with ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'', starring Rutger Hauer and [[Monique van de Ven]]. This film is based on a novel by bestselling Dutch author [[Jan Wolkers]] and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a young liberal girl from a conservative background. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1974. In 1999 the film won a [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf]] for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film ''[[Katie Tippel]]'' again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of ''Turkish Delight''.\n\n[[File:V.l.n.r. Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, regisseur Paul Verhoeven en Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk, Bestanddeelnr 932-5420.jpg|thumb|Paul Verhoeven (1983)]]\n\nVerhoeven built on his reputation and achieved international success with his [[Golden Globe]] nominated film ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24971 |title=Winners & Nominees: Soldier of Orange |work=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |year=1980 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> starring Rutger Hauer and [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]. The film, based on a true story about the Dutch resistance in [[World War II]], was written by [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. ''Soldier of Orange'' received the 1979 LA Film Critics Award for best foreign language film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in 1980.\n\nIn 1980 Verhoeven made the film ''[[Spetters]]'' with [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]] and Rutger Hauer. The story is sometimes compared to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', but the film has more explicit violence and sexuality (in this case also homosexuality), which are sometimes seen as the trademarks of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven's film ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983) is a horror film starring Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]]. It was written by [[Gerard Soeteman]] from a novel by the Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]]. This film would be Verhoeven's last Dutch film production until the 2006 film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]''.\n\n===Filmmaking in the United States (1983\u20132000)===\nGerard Soeteman also wrote the script for Verhoeven's first English-language film, ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), which starred [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Verhoeven moved to Hollywood for a wider range of opportunities in filmmaking. Working in the U.S., he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, violent, special-effects-heavy hits ''RoboCop'' and ''Total Recall''\u2060\u2014each of which won an [[Academy Special Achievement Award]]: ''[[RoboCop]]'' for Sound Effects Editing, and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' for Visual Effects, .\n\n[[File:Basic Instinct Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Presentation of ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival|1992]] [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Left to right: [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Michael Douglas]], Martine Tours (Verhoeven's wife), Verhoeven, [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Mario Kassar]]]]\n\nVerhoeven followed those successes with the equally intense and provocative ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing film of the year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]''. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993/B?qt-honorees=1#block-quicktabs-honorees |title=1993 Nominees (B) |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Verhoeven also worked on creating an historical epic based around the [[Crusades]] that would have starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film entered pre-production in 1993, but a year later the studio backing the film ([[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]]) pulled funding for the project.

In 2016 however, Verhoeven followed ''Black Book'' by directing a French film: ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'', an adaptation of a novel by [[Philippe Djian]]. A psycho-thriller where [[Isabelle Huppert]] plays a rape victim, Elle was selected for the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that Verhoeven would be the president of the jury for the [[67th Berlin International Film Festival]], scheduled to take place in February 2017.<ref name=\"Berlin2017\">{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Jury President of the Berlinale 2017: Paul Verhoeven |work=Berlinale |accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, ''[[Benedetta (film)|Benedetta]]'', his next French film, was announced to begin filming in August of the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/paul-verhoeven-approaches-blessed-virgin-with-elle-star-virginie-efira-1202399023/|title=Paul Verhoeven to Direct \u2018Blessed Virgin,\u2019 Based on True Story of Lesbian Nun|first1=Robert|last1=Mitchell|first2=Robert|last2=Mitchell|date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ecrannoir.fr/blog/blog/2018/03/06/virginie-efira-retourne-chez-paul-verhoeven/|title=Virginie Efira retourne chez Paul Verhoeven \" Le Blog d'Ecran Noir}}</ref> It is a biographical film about the life of [[Benedetta Carlini]], which will be portrayed by ''Elle'' co-star [[Virginie Efira]], and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book ''Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy'' by [[Judith C.

Active in both the [[Netherlands]] and Hollywood, Verhoeven's blending of graphic violence and sexual content with social satire are trademarks of both his [[Drama film|drama]] and [[science fiction film]]s. He directed the films ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' (1973), ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'' (1977), ''[[The Fourth Man]]'' (1983), ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), ''[[RoboCop]]'' (1987), ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' (1990), ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) and ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'' (2016).\n\n''Turkish Delight'' received the award for Best Dutch Film of the Century at the [[Netherlands Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmfestival.nl/publiek/films/turks-fruit |title=Turks fruit |work=[[Netherlands Film Festival]] |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> His films altogether received a total of nine [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, mainly for editing and effects. Verhoeven won the [[Saturn Award for Best Director]] for ''RoboCop''. His Dutch war film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]'' (2006) was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language]] and was voted by the Dutch public, in 2008, as the best Dutch film ever made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |title=Zwartboek beste film aller tijden |trans-title=Black Book: best film of all time |language=Dutch |work=Cinema.nl |date=3 October 2008 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720164057/http://www.cinema.nl/artikelen/4084816/zwartboek-beste-film-aller-tijden |archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref> In contrast, he won the [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for ''Showgirls''; he is one of the few people to have [[List of people who have accepted Golden Raspberry Awards|accepted their Golden Raspberry awards]] in person, and was the first person to go to the ceremony to receive it. In 2016 he directed ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'', which won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].\n\n''[[The Seattle Times]]'' praised Verhoeven by saying, \"director Paul Verhoeven often appears to be a one-man Dutch movie industry,\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hartl |first=John |title='The Fourth Man' is occult thriller that holds suspense |newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=7 June 1985 |page=22}}</ref> while ''[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' called Verhoeven \"a busy bee whose movies pollinate the festival circuit.\"<ref>{{cite news |last= Elliott |first= David |title='The Fourth Man' is half-baked film |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=20 July 1984 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nPaul Verhoeven was born in [[Amsterdam]] on 18 July 1938, the son of a [[Teacher|school teacher]], Wim Verhoeven, and a [[Hatmaking|hat maker]], Nel van Schaardenburg. His family lived in the village of [[Slikkerveer]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1943 the family moved to [[The Hague]], the location of the German headquarters in the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The Verhoeven house was near a German military base with [[V-weapons|V1 and V2-rocket launchers]], which was repeatedly bombed by Allied forces. Their neighbours' house was hit and Verhoeven's parents were almost killed when bombs fell on a street crossing. From this period, Verhoeven mentioned in interviews, he remembers images of violence, burning houses, dead bodies on the street, and continuous danger. As a small child he experienced the war as an exciting adventure and compares himself with the character Bill Rowan in ''[[Hope and Glory (film)|Hope and Glory]]'' (1987).<ref name=\"oorlog\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethesis.net/verhoeven/verhoeven_deel_1.htm|title=Een beetje oorlog, best spannend|trans-title=A little war, quite exciting|work=De cinema van Paul Verhoeven: voorbij de controverse|first=Rob |last=Testelmans|year=2003|accessdate=17 October 2006|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's father became head teacher at the [[Van Heutszschool]] in The Hague, and Paul attended this school. Sometimes they watched informative films at home with the school's [[Movie projector|film projector]]. Verhoeven and his father also liked to see American films that were in the cinema after the liberation, such as ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'' (1952).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThey went ten times to see ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]'' (1953). Verhoeven was a fan of the Dutch comic ''[[Dick Bos]]'' ([[:nl:Dick Bos|nl]]). The character Dick Bos is a private detective who fights crime using [[jujutsu]]. Verhoeven liked comic drawing; he created ''The Killer'', a character in a detailed story of revenge. Other fiction he liked were ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] [[Barsoom]] series.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nVerhoeven attended public secondary school [[Gymnasium Haganum]] in The Hague. Later, beginning in 1955, he studied at [[Leiden University]], where he joined the elite fraternity ''Minerva''. Verhoeven graduated with a [[doctorandus]] (MSc) with a double major, in Mathematics and [[Physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|title=What's new?|work=paulverhoeven.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220013620/http://www.paulverhoeven.net/index2.asp|archivedate=20 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wiskundemeisjes.nl/20060913/paul-verhoeven|title=Paul Verhoeven profile|work=Wiskundemeisjes.nl|accessdate=3 February 2017|language=Dutch}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Short films and TV series (1960\u20131969)===\nVerhoeven made his first film ''A Lizzard Too Much'' for the anniversary of his [[Student Corps|students' corps]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |title=Paul Verhoeven: Biography |work=gonemovies.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129125642/http://www.gonemovies.com/WWW/TopFilms/Verhoeven/RegiseurVerhoeven.asp |archivedate=29 January 2007 |accessdate=3 February 2017 |language=Dutch}}</ref> In his last years at university Verhoeven also attended classes at the [[Netherlands Film and Television Academy|Netherlands Film Academy]]. After this he made three more short films: ''Nothing Special'' (1961), ''The Hitchhikers'' (1962), and ''Let's Have a Party'' (1963).\n\nVerhoeven has not used his mathematics and physics degree, opting instead to invest his energies in a career in film. After his studies he entered the [[Royal Dutch Navy]] as a conscript. He made the documentary ''Het Korps Mariniers'' (\"''The Marine Corps''\", 1965), which won the French ''Golden Sun'' award for military films.<ref name=\"oorlog\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Verhoeven married Martine Tours, with whom he later had two daughters, Claudia (b. 1972), and Helen (b. 1974).\n\nWhen he left the Navy, Verhoeven took his skills to Dutch television. First, he made a documentary about [[Anton Mussert]] named ''Mussert'' (1968). His first major success was the 1969 ''[[Floris (TV series)|Floris]]'' television series, starring [[Rutger Hauer]]. The concept of ''Floris'' was inspired by foreign series like ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' and ''[[Thierry La Fronde]]''.\n\n===First feature films (1969\u20131983)===\nVerhoeven's first feature film ''[[Business Is Business (film)|Business Is Business]]'' was released in 1971 and was not well received. His first national success came in 1973 with ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'', starring Rutger Hauer and [[Monique van de Ven]]. This film is based on a novel by bestselling Dutch author [[Jan Wolkers]] and tells the passionate love story of an artist and a young liberal girl from a conservative background. The film received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1974. In 1999 the film won a [[Golden Calf (award)|Golden Calf]] for Best Dutch Film of the Century. Verhoeven's 1975 film ''[[Katie Tippel]]'' again featured Hauer and van de Ven, but it would not match the success of ''Turkish Delight''.\n\n[[File:V.l.n.r. Jeroen Krabb\u00e9, regisseur Paul Verhoeven en Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk, Bestanddeelnr 932-5420.jpg|thumb|Paul Verhoeven (1983)]]\n\nVerhoeven built on his reputation and achieved international success with his [[Golden Globe]] nominated film ''[[Soldier of Orange]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hfpa.org/browse/film/24971 |title=Winners & Nominees: Soldier of Orange |work=Hollywood Foreign Press Association |year=1980 |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> starring Rutger Hauer and [[Jeroen Krabb\u00e9]]. The film, based on a true story about the Dutch resistance in [[World War II]], was written by [[Erik Hazelhoff Roelfzema]]. ''Soldier of Orange'' received the 1979 LA Film Critics Award for best foreign language film. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe in 1980.\n\nIn 1980 Verhoeven made the film ''[[Spetters]]'' with [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]] and Rutger Hauer. The story is sometimes compared to ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', but the film has more explicit violence and sexuality (in this case also homosexuality), which are sometimes seen as the trademarks of Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven's film ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]'' (1983) is a horror film starring Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and [[Ren\u00e9e Soutendijk]]. It was written by [[Gerard Soeteman]] from a novel by the Dutch writer [[Gerard Reve]]. This film would be Verhoeven's last Dutch film production until the 2006 film ''[[Black Book (film)|Black Book]]''.\n\n===Filmmaking in the United States (1983\u20132000)===\nGerard Soeteman also wrote the script for Verhoeven's first English-language film, ''[[Flesh and Blood (1985 film)|Flesh and Blood]]'' (1985), which starred [[Rutger Hauer]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. Verhoeven moved to Hollywood for a wider range of opportunities in filmmaking. Working in the U.S., he made a serious change in style, directing big-budget, violent, special-effects-heavy hits ''RoboCop'' and ''Total Recall''\u2060\u2014each of which won an [[Academy Special Achievement Award]]: ''[[RoboCop]]'' for Sound Effects Editing, and ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'' for Visual Effects, .\n\n[[File:Basic Instinct Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Presentation of ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival|1992]] [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Left to right: [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Michael Douglas]], Martine Tours (Verhoeven's wife), Verhoeven, [[Sharon Stone]] and [[Mario Kassar]]]]\n\nVerhoeven followed those successes with the equally intense and provocative ''[[Basic Instinct]]'' (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing film of the year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in ''[[Turkish Delight (1973 film)|Turkish Delight]]'' and ''[[The Fourth Man (1983 film)|The Fourth Man]]''. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1993/B?qt-honorees=1#block-quicktabs-honorees |title=1993 Nominees (B) |work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Verhoeven also worked on creating an historical epic based around the [[Crusades]] that would have starred [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. The film entered pre-production in 1993, but a year later the studio backing the film ([[Carolco Pictures|Carolco]]) pulled funding for the project. Verhoeven would continue to discuss the film throughout the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/14094/the-7-films-that-arnold-schwarzenegger-never-made|title=The 7 films that Arnold Schwarzenegger never made|last=Brew|first=Simon|date=3 March 2009|website=[[Den of Geek]]|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flixist.com/from-hell-paul-verhoeven-arnold-schwarzenegger-s-crusade-207103.phtml|title=From Hell: Paul Verhoeven/Arnold Schwarzenegger's Crusade|last=Vigilla|first=Hubert|date=29 February 2012|website=Flixist|url-status=live|access-date=25 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yakir|first=Dan|date=February 1996|title=Starship Instincts|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-223/page/n33|journal=[[Starlog]]|issue=223|pages=34\u201335|via=[[Internet Archive]]}}</ref>\n\nVerhoeven's next film was the poorly received, NC-17 rated ''[[Showgirls]]'' (1995), about a stripper in [[Las Vegas]] trying to make a career as a showgirl. The film won seven [[1995 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Awards]] including Worst Film and Worst Director; Verhoeven became the first director to accept his \"award\" in person.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000558/1996/1/|title=Razzie Awards (1996)|publisher=IMDb}}</ref> Afterward, the film enjoyed success on the [[home video]] market, generating more than $100&nbsp;million from video rentals<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wiser |first=Paige |title=The beauty of 'Showgirls' |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=27 July 2004}}</ref> and became one of [[MGM]]'s top 20 all-time bestsellers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS |title=Showgirls DVD |work=MGM |date=28 April 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428172642/http://www.mgm.com/title_title.php?title_star=SHOWGRLS |archivedate=28 April 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Basic Instinct'' and ''Showgirls'', Verhoeven returned to the science fiction, graphic violence and special-effects tropes that had marked his earlier films with ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' (1997), loosely based on the novel of the same name by [[Robert A. Heinlein]],<ref name=\"gemsbok\">{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/thursday-theater-starship-troopers-paul-verhoeven-robert-heinlein/|title=Poking Fun at Militarism: How Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Cult Classic ''Starship Troopers'' Willfully Discards Robert Heinlein\u2019s Novel|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=4 February 2016|website=The Gemsbok|accessdate=7 December 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Hollow Man]]'' (2000). Each film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects.\n\n===Return to Europe (2006\u2013present)===\nAfter about 20 years of working and living in the United States, Verhoeven returned to the Netherlands for the shooting of a new film.

Some of those titles were produced with other directors at the helm, such as ''[[The Paperboy (2012 film)|The Paperboy]]''. In 2016 however, Verhoeven followed ''Black Book'' by directing a French film: ''[[Elle (film)|Elle]]'', an adaptation of a novel by [[Philippe Djian]]. A psycho-thriller where [[Isabelle Huppert]] plays a rape victim, Elle was selected for the Official Competition at the Cannes International Film Festival, where it obtained very favourable reviews.\n\nIn December 2016, it was announced that Verhoeven would be the president of the jury for the [[67th Berlin International Film Festival]], scheduled to take place in February 2017.<ref name=\"Berlin2017\">{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/das_festival/preise_und_juries/preise_internationale_jury/index.html |title=Jury President of the Berlinale 2017: Paul Verhoeven |work=Berlinale |accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2017, ''[[Benedetta (film)|Benedetta]]'', his next French film, was announced to begin filming in August of the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/global/paul-verhoeven-approaches-blessed-virgin-with-elle-star-virginie-efira-1202399023/|title=Paul Verhoeven to Direct \u2018Blessed Virgin,\u2019 Based on True Story of Lesbian Nun|first1=Robert|last1=Mitchell|first2=Robert|last2=Mitchell|date=26 April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ecrannoir.fr/blog/blog/2018/03/06/virginie-efira-retourne-chez-paul-verhoeven/|title=Virginie Efira retourne chez Paul Verhoeven \" Le Blog d'Ecran Noir}}</ref> It is a biographical film about the life of [[Benedetta Carlini]], which will be portrayed by ''Elle'' co-star [[Virginie Efira]], and is an adaptation of the non-fiction book ''Immodest Acts - The life of a lesbian nun in Renaissance Italy'' by [[Judith C.

He was known as \"Kaishsha\" in [[Bangladesh]]. His scenes are dubbed into bengali by an online group named \"pagla director\".\n\nThroughout his comedy career, Shimura was known for his \"Bakatono-sama\" character, which was unusual among Japanese comedians, in that he could satirize the deeds of powerful figures (a company president, a politician, a family head, a school principal, the head of a Japanese yakuza gang) under the garb of a foolish king who lived in the country a long time ago. Another popular shtick of Shimura in the same show was \"Henna Oji-san\" [weirdo] who entertained himself in the company of nubile girls. After being caught for his pranks, the character regularly ended the shtick with a song 'Sou desu. Watashi wa Henna Oji-san desu'. (\"That is correct. I am Henna Oji-san.\") He was also known for his nonsense catchphrase \"Daffuna\" which would often end a Henna Oji-san skit.\n\nShimura was most famous for starring in {{ill|Hachiji Da Yo! Zen'in Shugo!|ja|8\u6642\u3060\u30e7!\u5168\u54e1\u96c6\u5408}} with the comedy group [[The Drifters (Japanese band)|The Drifters]] and [[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]] with [[Cha Kato]], another former member of The Drifters.\n\nShimura's comedic work was inspired in part by that of [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken Shimura dead of coronavirus; Japanese comic was 70 years old |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=March 30, 2020 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/03/30/ken-shimura-dies-coronavirus-japanese-comic-70-years-old/5085889002/}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2020}}\nShimura became known in 1974, replacing Chu Arai<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/03/af7259e5ad04-breaking-news-japan-comedian-ken-shimura-dies-after-coronavirus-infection.html|title=Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies of coronavirus-related pneumonia|last=|first=|website=Kyodo News+|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref> in the famous comedy group [[The_Drifters_(Japanese_band)|The Drifters]].<ref name=\":0\" /> With the help of the other members of the group, he learned to act and make the audience laugh. Over time, he showed a knack for comedy. Some memorable pictures of that time are the mustache dance, in which he starred with [[Cha Kat\u014d]] and the song [[Higashimurayama, Tokyo|Higashimurayama]], referring to his homeland.\n\nWith this group,  he participated in the weekly program ''Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo!'' from 1974 to 1985, reaching 40% to 50% of viewers at their best. From 1977, he also participated in the television program ''Dorifu Daibakusho'' (\"Dorifu, big burst of laughter\"), which were special sketches, totaling one and a half hours. It is currently possible to see members together only on television specials.\n\n\nThe rapport Shimura had with [[Cha Kat\u014d]], also a member of [[Higashimurayama, Tokyo|Higashimurayama]], kept them together on television. In 1986, they created the &nbsp;''Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen Terebi'', which aired until 1992. In ''The Detective Story'', they are two detective friends who get into a lot of trouble. The high ratings allowed for high-cost scenes with exploding cars, helicopters and crowds. A famous painting of this time is Shimura as a monk, who asked people to repeat the words \"Daijoubuda, ... ueh, ueh, ueh\", whereas \"daijoubuda\" literally means \"I'm all right.\"\n\nThis program ran about three times a year since 1986. In it, Shimura is a feudal [[lord]] (\"tono\") who does not want to rule and only thinks about having fun. The character was created at the time of ''Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo!'' and is characterized by an all-white face, extremely thick eyebrows and hair tied at the top of the head. The program always featured celebrity stakes.\n\n\"Ken Shimura Daijoubuda\" from 1987 to 1993 and was the beginning of Shimura's career as the sole leader. His new companions were also his \"disciples\" in the sense that they learned from Shimura. Among others, [[Masashi Tashiro]], his first favorite \"disciple\", Yoko Ishino, favorite \"disciple\" and former bride Nobuyoshi Kuwano, who played the trumpet, and Noriko Matsumoto. At that time, Shimura created the famous character \"henna ojisan\", which means \"strange uncle\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/03/30/ken-shimura-dies-coronavirus-japanese-comic-70-years-old/5085889002/|title=Popular Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies from coronavirus|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Daijoubuda===\nFollowing up his previous big hits, Shimura led several shows, mostly on the [[Fuji TV]] network with the renewal of his \"disciples\". The most famous of them was [[Masashi Tashiro]]. However, after Tashiro's involvement with voyeurism, drugs, and subsequent arrests, Shimura, disappointed, cut him from their act. From 1996, he began working with newbie Yuuka, who eventually became his favorite \"disciple\".

He was known as \"Kaishsha\" in [[Bangladesh]].\n\nThroughout his comedy career, Shimura was known for his \"Bakatono-sama\" character, which was unusual among Japanese comedians, in that he could satirize the deeds of powerful figures (a company president, a politician, a family head, a school principal, the head of a Japanese yakuza gang) under the garb of a foolish king who lived in the country a long time ago. Another popular shtick of Shimura in the same show was \"Henna Oji-san\" [weirdo] who entertained himself in the company of nubile girls. After being caught for his pranks, the character regularly ended the shtick with a song 'Sou desu. Watashi wa Henna Oji-san desu'. (\"That is correct. I am Henna Oji-san.\") He was also known for his nonsense catchphrase \"Daffuna\" which would often end a Henna Oji-san skit.\n\nShimura was most famous for starring in {{ill|Hachiji Da Yo!

Over time, he showed a knack for comedy. Some memorable pictures of that time are the mustache dance, in which he starred with [[Cha Kat\u014d]] and the song [[Higashimurayama, Tokyo|Higashimurayama]], referring to his homeland.\n\nWith this group,  he participated in the weekly program ''Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo!'' from 1974 to 1985, reaching 40% to 50% of viewers at their best. From 1977, he also participated in the television program ''Dorifu Daibakusho'' (\"Dorifu, big burst of laughter\"), which were special sketches, totaling one and a half hours. It is currently possible to see members together only on television specials.\n\n\nThe rapport Shimura had with [[Cha Kat\u014d]], also a member of [[Higashimurayama, Tokyo|Higashimurayama]], kept them together on television. In 1986, they created the &nbsp;''Kato-chan Ken-chan Gokigen Terebi'', which aired until 1992. In ''The Detective Story'', they are two detective friends who get into a lot of trouble. The high ratings allowed for high-cost scenes with exploding cars, helicopters and crowds. A famous painting of this time is Shimura as a monk, who asked people to repeat the words \"Daijoubuda, ... ueh, ueh, ueh\", whereas \"daijoubuda\" literally means \"I'm all right.\"\n\nThis program ran about three times a year since 1986. In it, Shimura is a feudal [[lord]] (\"tono\") who does not want to rule and only thinks about having fun. The character was created at the time of ''Hachiji Dayo! Zen'inshugo!'' and is characterized by an all-white face, extremely thick eyebrows and hair tied at the top of the head. The program always featured celebrity stakes.\n\n\"Ken Shimura Daijoubuda\" from 1987 to 1993 and was the beginning of Shimura's career as the sole leader. His new companions were also his \"disciples\" in the sense that they learned from Shimura. Among others, [[Masashi Tashiro]], his first favorite \"disciple\", Yoko Ishino, favorite \"disciple\" and former bride Nobuyoshi Kuwano, who played the trumpet, and Noriko Matsumoto. At that time, Shimura created the famous character \"henna ojisan\", which means \"strange uncle\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/03/30/ken-shimura-dies-coronavirus-japanese-comic-70-years-old/5085889002/|title=Popular Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies from coronavirus|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Post-Daijoubuda===\nFollowing up his previous big hits, Shimura led several shows, mostly on the [[Fuji TV]] network with the renewal of his \"disciples\".

{"title_page": "An Unbelievable Story of Rape", "text_new": "\"'''An Unbelievable Story of Rape'''\" is a 2015 article about a [[Washington and Colorado serial rape cases|series of rapes]] in the U.S. states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]] that occurred between 2008 and 2011, and the subsequent police investigations. It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

It was a collaboration between two American, non-profit news organizations, [[The Marshall Project]] and [[ProPublica]]. The article was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T. Christian Miller]]. It won the 2016 [[Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting]] and the 2015 [[George Polk Award]] for Justice Reporting.\n\nThe article alternates between two true stories of events occurring between August 2008 and June 2012. The first narrative is about a woman in [[Lynnwood, Washington]], known pseudonymously as \"Marie\", who reports being raped to the police. After repeated interrogation by the police, who do not believe her, she says that her report was false. She is subsequently charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]] for false accusation. The second narrative details the police investigations into a serial rapist in Colorado, who is known to have raped four women and made a fifth attempt. The man is arrested in February 2011, and subsequent evidence on his hard drive reveals that Marie, not previously known to the local investigative team, was raped by him.\n\nT. Christian Miller of ProPublica had been reporting on law enforcement failures in identifying rapists throughout 2015. In August, he learned of the case of Marie and contacted her lawyer, discovering that Ken Armstrong of The Marshall Project was already working on a similar story. They began to collaborate, with Armstrong writing about Marie's story in Washington and Miller writing about the police investigation in Colorado. Marie agreed to speak to Armstrong after six months of communication. The article was further informed by other interviews and thousands of pages of public records material.\n\nThe article was later adapted into the Netflix series ''[[Unbelievable (miniseries)|Unbelievable]]'', which has received critical acclaim. The article also provided the basis of Miller and Armstrong's full-length book ''A False Report: A True Story of Rape in America'' (2018).\n\n==Article content==\nIn [[Lynnwood, Washington]], an 18-year-old woman, referred to as \"Marie,\" reported being bound, gagged and raped at knifepoint to police. Following police confrontation about inconsistencies in her story, she said that she made the incident up. In March 2009, she was charged with a [[gross misdemeanor]], fined $500 and put on probation. Marie had been sexually and physically abused in early life and was in foster care for most of her childhood. She joined Project Ladder at age 18, a program designed for people transitioning from foster care to living alone.\n\nIn [[Golden, Colorado]] during January 2011, Detective Stacy Galbraith interviewed a woman who was raped at gunpoint for four hours. When Galbraith talked to her husband, he observed familiarity with an incident reported to his police department in Westminster. Galbraith began collaboration with Westminster Detective Edna Hendershot, who had investigated two cases in which women aged 59 and 65 were raped in similar ways. They also discovered a burglary where a masked man had attempted to tie up a 46-year-old woman, who jumped out of her window and was badly injured. The four known cases took place in different suburbs of [[Denver]]. The man had gone to extreme lengths to avoid leaving DNA evidence, but [[touch DNA]] from the same paternal family line was found at three scenes.\n\nMarie had made her report in August 2008 to Sergeant Jeffrey Mason and Jerry Rittgarn. Police guidelines advised that rape victims should not be interrogated, as they may be uncertain of details or report conflicting information. Investigating Marie's report, police found evidence of an assailant and abrasions to Marie's vagina and wrist. However, two of Marie's former foster parents began to disbelieve her due to her seemingly calm demeanour, one reporting doubts to the police. Following this, and Marie's conflicting account of when she phoned a friend, Mason and Rittgarn made Marie repeat her story, Rittgarn saying that he disbelieved her. He asked if the rapist was real and she said \"no.\" Without reading the [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' warning]], they asked her to write that she had made a false report. She wrote instead that she had dreamed the incident, now unsure of what happened. After hours of further questioning, Marie wrote that she had been lying.\n\nProject Ladder staff made Marie return to police when she said she made the report under [[duress]]. She asked to take a [[polygraph test]]\u2014though such tests do not provide reliable evidence\u2014but declined when Rittgarn threatened jail and loss of housing if she failed it. Mason filed a false reporting charge; such charges in similar circumstances were rare. Marie became the subject of media reports and an attack website. She quit her [[Costco]] job and considered suicide. In October 2008, one of Marie's foster parents saw a report of a woman in [[Kirkland, Washington]] raped in the same way as Marie. Kirkland police abandoned this lead after Lynnwood police told them at least twice that Marie's account was a lie.\n\nIn February 2011, a report was unearthed of a suspicious vehicle registered to army veteran Marc Patrick O'Leary, whose description matched the attacker. FBI agents collected DNA evidence from his brother which showed one of them was the rapist. A search warrant led to the arrest of O'Leary. He possessed a mask, gun, women's underwear and other identifying evidence. Photographs of Marie were found on O'Leary's hard drive. O'Leary had watched women for hundreds of hours, breaking into their houses multiple times before each rape. In December 2011, O'Leary was sentenced to 327.5 years in prison for four incidents in Colorado. In June 2012, he was sentenced to an additional 38.5 years for two incidents in Washington.\n\nAn external report condemned the handling of Marie's case. It described the officers' behaviour as \"bullying\" and highlighted threats of jail and housing assistance removal as \"coercive, cruel, and unbelievably unprofessional.\" An internal review also concluded that Mason and Rittgarn's behaviour was \"designed to elicit a confession of false reporting.\" In 2015, the commander of Lynnwood's Criminal Investigations Division said that practices had since changed. Neither Mason nor Rittgarn were disciplined. After Marie approached Mason, he offered an apology. Marie sued the city, winning $150,000. By the time of the article, Marie was married with two children.<ref name=\"Unbelievable Marshall\"/><ref name=\"Unbelievable ProPublica\"/>\n\n==Background==\n===History===\n\"An Unbelievable Story of Rape\" was written by [[Ken Armstrong (journalist)|Ken Armstrong]] and [[T.

He appeared in [[June Allyson]]'s [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]] [[anthology series]] ''[[The DuPont Show with June Allyson]]'' in the episode \"Child Lost\"; in ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode \"[[Walking Distance]]\"; a few episodes of the first season of the sitcom ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', as Stewart, one of Dennis's friends; and several first- and second-season episodes of ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.

Credited as \"Ronny Howard\", he portrayed the son of the title character (played by [[Andy Griffith]]) for all eight seasons of the show. Recalling his experiences as a child actor on set, he commented\n\n<blockquote> I was five years old. And I was preoccupied with the prop that was in my hand, because it was a toy turtle. But I had to pretend it was a real turtle that the audience just wasn't seeing, and it was dead, so I was supposed to be crying and very emotional, and I remember him looking at that little turtle and talking to me about how it was kind of funny to have to pretend that was dead. So I recall just a very relaxed first impression.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://ew.com/article/2012/07/03/ron-howard-andy-griffith| title=Andy Griffith: Ron Howard shares memories| journal=Entertainment Weekly| last=Howard| first=Ron| date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Cara Williams Ron Howard Pete and Gladys 1960.JPG|thumb|right|With [[Cara Williams]] in ''[[Pete and Gladys]]'' in 1960]]\nIn the 1962 film version of ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'', Howard played [[Winthrop Paroo]], the child with the lisp; the film starred [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] and [[Shirley Jones]].

[[Thurl Ravenscroft]] plays the Narrator, Pete Reneday plays the Ghost Host, and Eleanor Audley plays Madame Leota.

In the episode, Seth wants to learn to play an instrument in his father's band, but it looks as if he will not have the time; he has been diagnosed with leukemia.
