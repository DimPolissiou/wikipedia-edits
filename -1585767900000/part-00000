Around 800, [[Louis the Pious]], son of [[Charlemagne]], appointed [[Einhard]], the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. However, both in 851 and 879, the city was plundered  by the [[Viking]]s.\n[[File:Engelbert Van Siclers - De Kouter in Ghent in 1763.jpg|277px|thumb|''De Kouter in Ghent in 1763'' by [[Engelbert van Siclers]]]]\n\nWithin the protection of the [[County of Flanders]], the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small [[city-state]]. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after [[Paris]]; it was bigger than [[Cologne]] or [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=David|title=The Domestic Life of a Medieval City: Women, Children and the Family in Fourteenth Century Ghent|pages=1}}</ref> Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The [[Belfry of Ghent|belfry]] and the towers of the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] and [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint Nicholas' Church]] are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.\n\nThe rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' (\"[[water-meadows]]\": a word related to the English '[[marsh]]') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for [[cloth]].\n\nThe [[Wool#History|wool industry]], originally established at [[Bruges]], created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High [[Middle Ages]]. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from [[Scotland]] and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with [[Scotland#Medieval period|Scotland]] and [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England]]. Ghent was the birthplace of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]]. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the [[Hundred Years' War]].\n\n===Early modern period===\nThe city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]. High taxes [[Revolt of Ghent (1449\u20131453)|led to a rebellion]] and eventually the [[Battle of Gavere]] in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of [[Philip the Good]]. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges\u2013Ghent) to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] ([[Antwerp]]\u2013[[Brussels]]), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|revolts against Maximilian of Austria]], the first monarch of the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Flanders]].\n\n[[File:Ghent hist centrum 2.jpg|left|thumb|Buildings along the [[Leie]] river in the city of Ghent]]\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Justitiepaleis, Ghent, Belgium, ca. 1895.jpg|left|thumb|The Palace of Justice in Ghent, c. 1895]]\n\nIn 1500, [[Juana of Castile]] gave birth to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: ''\"strop\"'') around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called \"''Stroppendragers''\" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for [[Kingdom of Spain|Royal Spanish]] troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.\n\nThe late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city [[Fall of Ghent|was captured]] by French forces during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] before being returned to the [[Austria|Empire of Austria]]<nowiki/> under the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, when this part of [[Flanders]] became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]] until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]], the end of the French Revolutionary and later [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the peace treaties arrived at by the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. [[Lieven Bauwens]], having smuggled the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and factory machine plans out of [[England]], introduced the first mechanical [[Weaving machines|weaving machine]] on the [[European continent]] in 1800.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Ghent]], negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the [[War of 1812]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] (the North American phase of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Ghent and [[Flanders]], previously ruled from the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] in [[Vienna]] as the [[Austrian Netherlands]], became a part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own [[Ghent University|university]] (1816)<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\">[https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/why-ghent/ghent-over-centuries Ghent over the centuries: Concise history of a stubborn city]</ref> and a [[Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal|new connection to the sea]] (1824\u201327).\n\nAfter the [[Belgian Revolution]], with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1913)|world exhibition in Ghent]].<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\"/> As a preparation for these festivities, the [[Sint-Pieters railway station]] was completed in 1912.\n\n===20th century===\nGhent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during [[World War I]] is described by H. Wandt in \"etappenleven te Gent\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. In [[World War II]] the city was liberated by the British [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th \"Desert Rats\" Armoured Division]] and local Belgian fighters on 6 September 1944.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:GentMap.svg|{{largethumb}}|Municipalities]]\nAfter the fusions of municipalities in 1965 and 1977, the city is made up of:\n{{colbegin}}\n*I Ghent\n*II [[Mariakerke (East Flanders)|Mariakerke]]\n*III [[Drongen]]\n*IV [[Wondelgem]]\n*V [[Sint-Amandsberg]]\n*VI [[Oostakker]]\n*VII [[Desteldonk]]\n*VIII [[Mendonk]]\n*IX [[Sint-Kruis-Winkel]]\n*X [[Ledeberg]]\n*XI [[Gentbrugge]]\n*XII [[Afsnee]]\n*XIII [[Sint-Denijs-Westrem]]\n*XIV [[Zwijnaarde]]\n{{colend}}\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Wachtebeke]]\n* [[Lochristi]]\n* [[Destelbergen]]\n* [[Melle, Belgium|Melle]]\n* [[Merelbeke]]\n* [[De Pinte]]\n* [[Sint-Martens-Latem]]\n* [[Deinze]]\n* [[Nevele]]\n* [[Lovendegem]]\n* [[Evergem]]\n* [[Zelzate]]\n{{colend}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round.

From the 2019 census, it was concluded that 34.3% of the inhabitants have roots outside of Belgium and 14.5% have a non-Belgian nationality. In 2019, most of the immigrants came from [[Bulgaria]] (including [[Bulgarian Turks]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]]), followed by [[Turkey]], [[Netherlands|Holland]], [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].\n\nProjections indicate that Ghent will become a majority-minority city by 2040. A lot of neighborhoods already have a majority of inhabitants that are of foreign origin, such as Sluizeken-Tolhuis-Ham, Brugse Poort, Bloemekenswijk, Muide and Rabot. Other notable neighborhoods with almost a majority are Dampoort, Ledeberg and Nieuw Gent.\n\n==Tourism==\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Belgium-12 (37660701324).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Graslei]] is one of the most scenic places in Ghent's old city centre]]\n[[File:Gent Gravensteen R01.jpg|thumb|The [[Gravensteen castle|Gravensteen]]]]\n[[File:Ghent3.JPG|thumb|right|Historical centre of Ghent \u2013 from left to right: Old post office, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicholas Church]], [[Belfry of Ghent|Belfry]], and [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]]\n[[File:Ghent canal, night.jpg|thumb|Ghent at night]]\n[[File:Riverside at Ghent at noon.jpg|thumb|Riverside in Ghent]]\n[[File:Sunset over a canal in Ghent, Belgium.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the river [[Leie]] in Ghent]] <!-- from the Kning Albertbrug, looking west -->\nMuch of the city's [[medieval]] architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a [[Pedestrian zone|carfree area]]. Highlights are the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] with the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the [[belfry of Ghent|belfry]], the [[Gravensteen castle]], and the splendid architecture along the old [[Graslei]] harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three [[b\u00e9guinage]]s and numerous churches including Saint-Jacob's church, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicolas' church]], [[Saint Michael's church (Ghent)|Saint Michael's church]] and [[St. Stefanus, Ghent|St. Stefanus]].\n[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|The well-known ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', a 15th-century painting by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]] \nIn the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, [[Louis Roelandt]], built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the ''[[Boekentoren]]'' or Book Tower) by [[Henry Van de Velde]]. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.\n\nThe beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe [[Zebrastraat]], a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.\n\n[[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.\n\n===Museums===\nImportant museums in Ghent are the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent|Museum voor Schone Kunsten]] (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and many Flemish masters; the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|SMAK]] or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; and the [[Design Museum Gent]] with masterpieces of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Le Corbusier]]. The [[Huis van Alijn]] (House of the Alijn family) was originally a [[beguinage]] and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The ''Museum voor Industri\u00eble Archeologie en Textiel'' or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The [[Ghent City Museum]] (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.\n\n===Restaurants and culinary traditions===\nIn Ghent and other regions of [[East-Flanders]], bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a \"mastel\" (plural \"mastellen\"), which is basically a bagel. \"Mastellen\" are also called \"[[Saint Hubert]] bread\", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against [[rabies]].\n\nOther local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as [[Leonidas (chocolate)|Leonidas]], the [[cuberdon]]s or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.\n\n[[Carbonade flamande|Stoverij]] is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown [[Trappist beer|'Trappist']] (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. '[[Waterzooi]]' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.\n\nThe city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called ''Donderdag Veggiedag''<ref>[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=767 \"Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors\"] on Vegetarisme.be</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm \"Belgian city plans 'veggie' days\"] on [[BBC News]] (12 May 2009).</ref> with [[vegetarian]] food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].\n\nGhent has the world's largest number of vegetarian restaurants per capita.<ref name=\"dailymail\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2508846/Belgium-breaks-The-best-way-glorious-Ghent-On-wheels-.html |title=Belgium breaks: The best way to see glorious Ghent?

Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (''Gentse Florali\u00ebn'') takes place in [[Flanders Expo]] in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.\n\nThe [[Festival of Flanders]] had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval [[inner city]] and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with ''[[Laus Polyphoniae]]''; Bruges with ''[[MAfestival Brugge|MAfestival]]''; Brussels with ''KlaraFestival''; Limburg with ''Basilica'', Mechelen and Brabant with ''Novecento'' and ''Transit'').\n\nThe city of Ghent will co-host the 2020 [[World Choir Games]] together with the city of [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interkultur.com/newsroom/choir-games/details/news/double-gold-for-next-host-country-of-the-world-choir-games-2020/|title=Double gold for next host country of the World Choir Games 2020/|website=INTERKULTUR|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> Organised by the [[Interkultur Foundation]], the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n===Nature===\nThe numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions.

It is accessed by the [[Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal]], which ends near the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] port of [[Terneuzen]] on the [[Western Scheldt]]. The port houses, among others, large companies like [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Volvo Cars]], [[Volvo Trucks]], [[Volvo Parts]], [[Honda]], and [[Stora Enso]].\n\nThe [[Ghent University]] and a number of research oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.\n\nAs the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has many hospitals, schools and shopping streets.

Around 800, [[Louis the Pious]], son of [[Charlemagne]], appointed [[Einhard]], the biographer of Charlemagne, as abbot of both abbeys. The city grew from several nuclei, the abbeys and a commercial centre. However, both in 851 and 879, the city was plundered  by the [[Viking]]s.\n[[File:Engelbert Van Siclers - De Kouter in Ghent in 1763.jpg|277px|thumb|''De Kouter in Ghent in 1763'' by [[Engelbert van Siclers]]]]\n\nWithin the protection of the [[County of Flanders]], the city recovered and flourished from the 11th century, growing to become a small [[city-state]]. By the 13th century, Ghent was the biggest city in Europe north of the Alps after [[Paris]]; it was bigger than [[Cologne]] or [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholas|first=David|title=The Domestic Life of a Medieval City: Women, Children and the Family in Fourteenth Century Ghent|pages=1}}</ref> Within the city walls lived up to 65,000 people. The [[Belfry of Ghent|belfry]] and the towers of the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] and [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint Nicholas' Church]] are just a few examples of the skyline of the period.\n\nThe rivers flowed in an area where much land was periodically flooded. These rich grass 'meersen' (\"[[water-meadows]]\": a word related to the English '[[marsh]]') were ideally suited for herding sheep, the wool of which was used for making cloth. During the Middle Ages Ghent was the leading city for [[cloth]].\n\nThe [[Wool#History|wool industry]], originally established at [[Bruges]], created the first European industrialized zone in Ghent in the High [[Middle Ages]]. The mercantile zone was so highly developed that wool had to be imported from [[Scotland]] and England. This was one of the reasons for Flanders' good relationship with [[Scotland#Medieval period|Scotland]] and [[History of England#England under the Plantagenets|England]]. Ghent was the birthplace of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of [[Duchy of Lancaster|Lancaster]]. Trade with England (but not Scotland) suffered significantly during the [[Hundred Years' War]].\n\n===Early modern period===\nThe city recovered in the 15th century, when Flanders was united with neighbouring provinces under the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]]. High taxes [[Revolt of Ghent (1449\u20131453)|led to a rebellion]] and eventually the [[Battle of Gavere]] in 1453, in which Ghent suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of [[Philip the Good]]. Around this time the centre of political and social importance in the Low Countries started to shift from Flanders (Bruges\u2013Ghent) to [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] ([[Antwerp]]\u2013[[Brussels]]), although Ghent continued to play an important role. With Bruges, the city led two [[Flemish revolts against Maximilian of Austria|revolts against Maximilian of Austria]], the first monarch of the [[House of Habsburg]] to rule [[Flanders]].\n\n[[File:Ghent hist centrum 2.jpg|left|thumb|Buildings along the [[Leie]] river in the city of Ghent]]\n[[File:Flickr - \u2026trialsanderrors - Justitiepaleis, Ghent, Belgium, ca. 1895.jpg|left|thumb|The Palace of Justice in Ghent, c. 1895]]\n\nIn 1500, [[Juana of Castile]] gave birth to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who became [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]]. Although native to Ghent, he punished the city after the 1539 [[Revolt of Ghent (1539)|Revolt of Ghent]] and obliged the city's nobles to walk in front of the Emperor barefoot with a noose (Dutch: ''\"strop\"'') around the neck; since this incident, the people of Ghent have been called \"''Stroppendragers''\" (noose bearers). Saint Bavo Abbey (not to be confused with the nearby Saint Bavo Cathedral) was abolished, torn down, and replaced with a fortress for [[Kingdom of Spain|Royal Spanish]] troops. Only a small portion of the abbey was spared demolition.\n\nThe late 16th and the 17th centuries brought devastation because of the [[Eighty Years' War]]. The war ended the role of Ghent as a centre of international importance. In 1745, the city [[Fall of Ghent|was captured]] by French forces during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] before being returned to the [[Austria|Empire of Austria]]<nowiki/> under the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] following the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in 1748, when this part of [[Flanders]] became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]] until 1815, the exile of the French Emperor [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]], the end of the French Revolutionary and later [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the peace treaties arrived at by the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n===19th century===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the textile industry flourished again in Ghent. [[Lieven Bauwens]], having smuggled the [[industrial revolution|industrial]] and factory machine plans out of [[England]], introduced the first mechanical [[Weaving machines|weaving machine]] on the [[European continent]] in 1800.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Ghent]], negotiated here and adopted on Christmas Eve 1814, formally ended the [[War of 1812]] between [[Great Britain]] and the [[United States]] (the North American phase of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]). After the [[Battle of Waterloo]], Ghent and [[Flanders]], previously ruled from the [[Habsburgs|House of Habsburg]] in [[Vienna]] as the [[Austrian Netherlands]], became a part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] with the northern Dutch for 15 years. In this period, Ghent established its own [[Ghent University|university]] (1816)<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\">[https://visit.gent.be/en/good-know/practical-information/why-ghent/ghent-over-centuries Ghent over the centuries: Concise history of a stubborn city]</ref> and a [[Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal|new connection to the sea]] (1824\u201327).\n\nAfter the [[Belgian Revolution]], with the loss of port access to the sea for more than a decade, the local economy collapsed and the first Belgian trade union originated in Ghent. In 1913 there was a [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1913)|world exhibition in Ghent]].<ref name=\"visit.gent.be\"/> As a preparation for these festivities, the [[Sint-Pieters railway station]] was completed in 1912.\n\n===20th century===\nGhent was occupied by the Germans in both World Wars but escaped severe destruction. The life of the people and the German invaders in Ghent during [[World War I]] is described by H. Wandt in \"etappenleven te Gent\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

From the 2019 census, it was concluded that 34.3% of the inhabitants have roots outside of Belgium and 14.5% have a non-Belgian nationality. In 2019, most of the immigrants came from [[Bulgaria]] (including [[Bulgarian Turks]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]]), followed by [[Turkey]], [[Netherlands|Holland]], [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]].\n\nProjections indicate that Ghent will become a majority-minority city by 2040. A lot of neighborhoods already have a majority of inhabitants that are of foreign origin, such as Sluizeken-Tolhuis-Ham, Brugse Poort, Bloemekenswijk, Muide and Rabot. Other notable neighborhoods with almost a majority are Dampoort, Ledeberg and Nieuw Gent.\n\n==Tourism==\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Belgium-12 (37660701324).jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Graslei]] is one of the most scenic places in Ghent's old city centre]]\n[[File:Gent Gravensteen R01.jpg|thumb|The [[Gravensteen castle|Gravensteen]]]]\n[[File:Ghent3.JPG|thumb|right|Historical centre of Ghent \u2013 from left to right: Old post office, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicholas Church]], [[Belfry of Ghent|Belfry]], and [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]]\n[[File:Ghent canal, night.jpg|thumb|Ghent at night]]\n[[File:Riverside at Ghent at noon.jpg|thumb|Riverside in Ghent]]\n[[File:Sunset over a canal in Ghent, Belgium.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the river [[Leie]] in Ghent]] <!-- from the Kning Albertbrug, looking west -->\nMuch of the city's [[medieval]] architecture remains intact and is remarkably well preserved and restored. Its centre is a [[Pedestrian zone|carfree area]]. Highlights are the [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] with the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', the [[belfry of Ghent|belfry]], the [[Gravensteen castle]], and the splendid architecture along the old [[Graslei]] harbour. Ghent has established a blend between comfort of living and history; it is not a city-museum. The city of Ghent also houses three [[b\u00e9guinage]]s and numerous churches including Saint-Jacob's church, [[Saint Nicholas' Church, Ghent|Saint-Nicolas' church]], [[Saint Michael's church (Ghent)|Saint Michael's church]] and [[St. Stefanus, Ghent|St. Stefanus]].\n[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|The well-known ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', a 15th century painting by Hubert and Jan Van Eyck in [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]].]] \nIn the 19th century Ghent's most famous architect, [[Louis Roelandt]], built the university hall Aula, the opera house and the main courthouse. Highlights of modern architecture are the university buildings (the ''[[Boekentoren]]'' or Book Tower) by [[Henry Van de Velde]]. There are also a few theatres from diverse periods.\n\nThe beguinages, as well as the belfry and adjacent cloth hall, were recognized by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Sites]] in 1998 and 1999.\n\nThe [[Zebrastraat]], a social experiment in which an entirely renovated site unites living, economy and culture, can also be found in Ghent.\n\n[[Campo Santo, Ghent|Campo Santo]] is a famous Catholic burial site of the nobility and artists.\n\n===Museums===\nImportant museums in Ghent are the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent|Museum voor Schone Kunsten]] (Museum of Fine Arts), with paintings by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and many Flemish masters; the [[Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst|SMAK]] or Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (City Museum for Contemporary Art), with works of the 20th century, including [[Joseph Beuys]] and [[Andy Warhol]]; and the [[Design Museum Gent]] with masterpieces of [[Victor Horta]] and [[Le Corbusier]]. The [[Huis van Alijn]] (House of the Alijn family) was originally a [[beguinage]] and is now a museum for folk art where theatre and puppet shows for children are presented. The ''Museum voor Industri\u00eble Archeologie en Textiel'' or MIAT displays the industrial strength of Ghent with recreations of workshops and stores from the 1800s and original spinning and weaving machines that remain from the time when the building was a weaving mill. The [[Ghent City Museum]] (Stadsmuseum, abbreviated STAM), is committed to recording and explaining the city's past and its inhabitants, and to preserving the present for future generations.\n\n===Restaurants and culinary traditions===\nIn Ghent and other regions of [[East-Flanders]], bakeries sell a donut-shaped bun called a \"mastel\" (plural \"mastellen\"), which is basically a bagel. \"Mastellen\" are also called \"[[Saint Hubert]] bread\", because on the Saint's feast day, which is 3 November, the bakers bring their batches to the early Mass to be blessed. Traditionally, it was thought that blessed mastellen immunized against [[rabies]].\n\nOther local delicacies are the praline chocolates from local producers such as [[Leonidas (chocolate)|Leonidas]], the [[cuberdon]]s or 'neuzekes' ('noses'), cone-shaped purple jelly-filled candies, 'babelutten' ('babblers'), hard butterscotch-like candy, and of course, on the more fiery side, the famous 'Tierenteyn', a hot but refined mustard that has some affinity to French 'Dijon' mustard.\n\n[[Carbonade flamande|Stoverij]] is a classic Flemish meat stew, preferably made with a generous addition of brown [[Trappist beer|'Trappist']] (strong abbey beer) and served with French fries. '[[Waterzooi]]' is a local stew originally made from freshwater fish caught in the rivers and creeks of Ghent, but nowadays often made with chicken instead of fish. It is usually served nouvelle-cuisine-style, and will be supplemented by a large pot on the side.\n\nThe city promotes a meat-free day on Thursdays called ''Donderdag Veggiedag''<ref>[http://www.vegetarisme.be/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=767 \"Ghent's veggie day: for English speaking visitors\"] on Vegetarisme.be</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8046970.stm \"Belgian city plans 'veggie' days\"] on [[BBC News]] (12 May 2009).</ref> with [[vegetarian]] food being promoted in public canteens for civil servants and elected councillors, in all city funded schools, and promotion of vegetarian eating options in town (through the distribution of \"veggie street maps\"). This campaign is linked to the recognition of the [[Environmental effects of meat production#Fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions|detrimental environmental effects of meat production]], which the [[United Nations]]' [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has established to represent nearly one-fifth of global [[greenhouse gas emissions]].\n\nGhent has the world's largest number of vegetarian restaurants per capita.<ref name=\"dailymail\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/article-2508846/Belgium-breaks-The-best-way-glorious-Ghent-On-wheels-.html |title=Belgium breaks: The best way to see glorious Ghent?

Also, every five years, an extensive botanical exhibition (''Gentse Florali\u00ebn'') takes place in [[Flanders Expo]] in Ghent, attracting numerous visitors to the city.\n\nThe [[Festival of Flanders]] had its 50th celebration in 2008. In Ghent it opens with the OdeGand City festivities that takes place on the second Saturday of September. Some 50 concerts take place in diverse locations throughout the medieval [[inner city]] and some 250 international artists perform. Other major Flemish cities hold similar events, all of which form part of the Festival of Flanders (Antwerp with ''[[Laus Polyphoniae]]''; Bruges with ''[[MAfestival Brugge|MAfestival]]''; Brussels with ''KlaraFestival''; Limburg with ''Basilica'', Mechelen and Brabant with ''Novecento'' and ''Transit'').\n\nThe city of Ghent will co-host the 2020 [[World Choir Games]] together with the city of [[Antwerp]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interkultur.com/newsroom/choir-games/details/news/double-gold-for-next-host-country-of-the-world-choir-games-2020/|title=Double gold for next host country of the World Choir Games 2020/|website=INTERKULTUR|access-date=2018-07-19}}</ref> Organised by the [[Interkultur Foundation]], the World Choir Games is the biggest choral competition and festival in the world.\n\n===Nature===\nThe numerous parks in the city can also be considered tourist attractions.

It is accessed by the [[Ghent\u2013Terneuzen Canal]], which ends near the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] port of [[Terneuzen]] on the [[Western Scheldt]]. The port houses, among others, large companies like [[ArcelorMittal]], [[Volvo Cars]], [[Volvo Trucks]], [[Volvo Parts]], [[Honda]], and [[Stora Enso]].\n\nThe [[Ghent University]] and a number of research oriented companies, such as Ablynx, Innogenetics, Cropdesign and Bayer Cropscience, are situated in the central and southern part of the city.\n\nAs the largest city in East Flanders, Ghent has many hospitals, schools and shopping streets. [[Flanders Expo]], the biggest event hall in Flanders and the second biggest in Belgium, is also located in Ghent. Tourism is becoming a major employer in the local area. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n== Transport ==\nAs one of the largest cities in Belgium, Ghent has a highly developed transport system.\n\n===Road===\n[[File:R4 gezien vanuit de Beekstraat - Gent.jpg|thumb|The R4 ringroad]]\nBy car the city is accessible via two motorways:\n*The [[European route E40|E40]] connects Ghent with [[Bruges]] and [[Ostend]] to the west, and with [[Brussels]], [[Leuven]] and [[Li\u00e8ge]] to the east.\n*The [[European route E17|E17]] connects Ghent with [[Sint-Niklaas]] and [[Antwerp]] to the north, and with [[Kortrijk]] and [[Lille]] to the south.\n\nIn addition Ghent also has two ringways:\n*The R4 connects the outskirts of Ghent with each other and the surrounding villages, and also leads to the [[European route E40|E40]] and [[European route E17|E17]] roads.\n*The R40 connects the different downtown quarters with each other and provides access to the main avenues.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Sint-Pietersstation.jpg|thumb|[[Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station]], Ghent]]\nThe municipality of Ghent comprises five [[railway station]]s:\n*[[Gent-Sint-Pieters railway station|Gent-Sint-Pieters Station]]: an international railway station with connections to Bruges, Brussels, Antwerp, Kortrijk, other Belgian towns and Lille.

After the war, he was offered a place at the [[London School of Economics]], where he specialized in [[Keynesian]] macro-economics and developed an early interest in the economics of inflation. During a tenure as Fellow in Political Economy at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore]], he was encouraged by future Nobel Prize winner [[Simon Kuznets]] to work on the relationship between growth and inflation. This led to the publication in 1962 of his book ''Economic Development and the Price Level'' which became a classic and went through a second edition in 1972. In this book, he followed Keynes's distinction between income and profit inflation and applied it to an early two-sector framework between the agricultural sector and the rest of the economy. He accorded great importance to the terms of trade between the two sectors as a determinant of inflation. He applied this analysis in country chapters on the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Russia and Latin American countries, with a special emphasis on Argentina.\n\nDuring a stint with the Harvard Development Advisory Service in [[Argentina]], he teamed with Belgian economist Willy van Ryckeghem to design a stabilization model of inflation in which bank credits played a central role in preventing a recession. Although never a [[monetarist]], he always recognized the importance of monetary policy, but also took into account structural factors driving inflation. Later, in their post mortem of the Argentine experience, the authors blamed the ultimate failure of the stabilization attempt on an unforeseen surge in meat prices following a meat shortage. In their other joint work ''A World of Inflation'', published in 1976, they resisted the prevailing monetarism of the seventies, and tested international differences in inflation rates by various structural variables, such as minimum employment rates and differential productivity rates between tradeables and nontradeables. \n\nGeoffrey Maynard was for 25 years professor of economics at the [[University of Reading]] and editor of the Bankers' Magazine. He also served as deputy chief economic adviser in the British Treasury under the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, [[Denis Healey]], from 1974 onwards, where he was a lone voice against incomes policy whilst remaining supportive of a cut in public spending to offset the jump in oil prices. He was later interviewed by [[Margaret Thatcher]] to become her chief economic adviser, but their memorable meeting was cut short after Maynard risked to answer \"Yes, but...\" to Mrs. Thatcher's dogmatic views, to which she answered: \"No buts...\" and ended the meeting. He then became director of economics at [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] and special advisor to [[David Rockefeller]] instead. He later got his revenge in his book ''The Economy under Mrs. Thatcher'', which was critical but not entirely unfavourable to her policies.\n<ref>[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/obituary-geoffrey-maynard-kxwtwlvnv Professor Geoffrey Maynard.] ''The Times'', 24 November 2017. retrieved 25 November 2017. {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''The Control of Inflation''.

After a brief spell with [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], Smith joined non-league side [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] in 1989. His most successful spell during his playing days was at [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]], spending two seasons with the club. After a season with [[Welling United F.C.|Welling United]], Smith returned to [[the Football League]] in 1993, when he signed for [[Barnet F.C.|Barnet]]. Following a spell at [[Aylesbury United F.C.|Aylesbury United]], Smith retired as a professional player, with his career blighted through numerous injuries.\n\nHe turned to the coaching side of the game in an attempt to forge a career for himself following his premature retirement. After a spell coaching at [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], Smith was appointed youth team coach at Wycombe Wanderers in 2004. He joined [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] ahead of the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] campaign, combining the roles of reserve team manager with his U18 managerial duties. Smith then worked as a scout for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 2007. His first managerial post was at MLS side [[Colorado Rapids]], when he was appointed as manager in November 2008, following a successful spell as interim head coach. He spent three seasons at Colorado, with the club winning the [[2010 MLS Cup]], the first major trophy in the club's history. Despite his success, Colorado opted against renewing Smith's contract in November 2011. In January 2012, Smith was appointed as manager of League One side Stevenage. He guided the club to the [[2011\u201312 Football League One#Play-offs|League One play-offs]] that season, where they were defeated over two legs in the semi-final. In March 2013, he was sacked by the club after a poor run of form during the second half of the [[2012\u201313 in English football|2012\u201313]] season.\n\n==Playing career==\nAfter a brief spell at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] as a schoolboy,<ref name=\"Gary Smith's Rapid Rise in Colorado\" /> Smith joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]'s youth academy in 1983.<ref name=\"Technical Staff \u2013 Gary Smith\" /> He progressed through the youth ranks at the club, and made one first-team appearance during the 1985\u201386 season.<ref name=\"Technical Staff \u2013 Gary Smith\" /> Smith was released in 1987, having spent four years on the books at Fulham.<ref name=\"Technical Staff \u2013 Gary Smith\" /> Smith signed for [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]] on a free transfer in November 1987, making his debut at the age of 18 in a 2\u20131 away victory at [[Halifax Town F.C.|Halifax Town]].<ref name=\"Player Profile \u2013 Gary Smith\" /> He went on to make 12 appearances for Colchester in all competitions during the [[1987\u201388 Colchester United F.C. season|1987\u201388]] season, his last a 4\u20130 defeat to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 2 May 1988.<ref name=\"Player Profile \u2013 Gary Smith\" /> He was released by the club at the end of the season.<ref name=\"Player Profile \u2013 Gary Smith\" /><ref name=\"Gary Smith's Rapid Rise in Colorado\" /> After a spell at [[Enfield F.C.|Enfield]] in the first half of the 1989\u201390 season, where he appeared against [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]] in October 1989,<ref>''Enfield vs Darlington match programme'' 7 October 1989.

During summer 1923, [[Walt Disney]] created \"The Disney Bros. Cartoon Studio\" in his uncle Robert Disney's garage, which was located at 4406 Kingswell Avenue, in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]] neighborhood of Los Angeles (just east of Hollywood). This garage has been on display at the Stanley Ranch Museum in Garden Grove since the 1980s, several blocks away from Disneyland.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Garden Grove Historical Society|url=http://www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/HistoricalSociety|website=City of Garden Grove|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}</ref> His brother [[Roy O. Disney]] was also in Los Angeles at the time. During October 1923, the brothers leased office space on the rear side of a real estate agency's office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. On October 16, 1923, Walt Disney accepted an offer from [[Margaret Winkler]] of [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] to distribute the new [[Alice Comedies]] starring [[Virginia Davis]]. It was also at this site where on January 14, 1924, [[Walt Disney]] met his future wife [[Lillian Bounds]], an \"ink and paint\" girl whom he personally hired. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to an office of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. The late Robert Disney's residence and the small office building that is home to 4649 and 4651 Kingswell Avenue have survived to the present and are still in use.\n\nIn 1925, [[Walt Disney]] placed a deposit on a new, considerably larger lot at 2719 Hyperion Avenue, and the studio moved there in January 1926. It was here where, after a train journey with his wife Lillian, Walt fully created the character of [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928. Here, too, the first color animated film, the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'', and the first animated cartoon using the [[multiplane camera]], ''[[The Old Mill]]'', were created. In 1937, the Hyperion studio produced the world's first full-length animated feature film, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']]. Disney's staff began to grow to a substantial size at the Hyperion studio, and [[Disney Legends]] such as [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] began their careers there. The Hyperion studio site was sold in 1940 and divided between two different industrial manufacturers, and in 1966 a subsequent owner demolished what was left of the studio complex and replaced it with the supermarket and shopping center that stand there today. To honor the company's former headquarters from 1926 to 1940, the name 'Hyperion' has been reused over the years by the Walt Disney Company for multiple divisions and attractions, including [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] and the [[Hyperion Theater]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Disney studios burbank entrance gate buena vista.jpg|thumb|The original entrance gate to Walt Disney Studios at 500 South Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California.]]\n\nThe current Walt Disney Studios, located at 500 South [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] Street, [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], was made possible by the revenue from the 1937 release of [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']].<ref name=\"lac\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Studios|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/walt-disney-studios|website=Los Angeles Conservancy|accessdate=October 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [[Walt Disney]] and his staff began the move from the old studio at Hyperion Avenue in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] from December 1939 to January 1940. Designed primarily by [[Kem Weber]] under the supervision of [[Walt Disney]] and his brother Roy, the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] Disney Studio buildings are the only studios that have been owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] to survive from the Golden Age of filming.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} A bungalow, the Shorts building and other small buildings that were located at the Hyperion Avenue location were moved to Burbank.<ref name=\"ut\" />\n\nDisney purposely planned his new Burbank studio around the animation process. The large Animation Building stood in the center of the campus, while adjacent outlying buildings were constructed for the ink-and-paint departments, the camera and editing departments, and the other various functions of the studio. Tunnels linked some of the buildings (to allow movement of animation materials without exposing them to the elements), and the lot also included a movie theatre, a [[sound stage]], and a commissary. The 1941 Disney feature [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|''The Reluctant Dragon'']], which combined live action with animated sequences and starred [[Robert Benchley]], served as a tour of the then-new studio. It was later frequently seen and toured on the various Disney television programs.\n\nAfter the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Oahu]] by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] on December 7, 1941, at least 500 [[United States Army]] personnel occupied Walt Disney Studios the next day for eight months during [[World War II]] in the period of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[Invasion of the United States|invasion scare]] in the few months of American entry into the war. During the war, Disney [[Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production|regularly produced propaganda and training films]] for the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] including [[United States Armed Forces|its armed forces]] to increase morale among Americans that the fight against the [[Axis powers]] was waged for a just cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/featured/2015/12/07/pearl-harbor-changed-everything-even-disney-studio/|first=Doobie|last=Moseley|date=December 7, 2015|title=Pearl Harbor Changed Everything, Even the Disney Studio|publisher=Laughing Place}}</ref>\n\nIn the years after the war, the studio began regular work on live-action features, as they needed the money. Though their first films were shot in England, the necessity to build live-action facilities still arose. Lacking the capital to do it themselves, Jack Webb offered to put up some of the money to build live-action soundstages in exchange for the right to use them (Webb used them to shoot much of the ''Dragnet'' TV series). During this time, backlots for exterior shots were also built and remained standing at the studios until after a major change in management in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, after the corporate restructuring of Walt Disney Productions into The Walt Disney Company, the studio lot was remodeled to accommodate more live-action production space and administrative offices. The studio lot is now home to multiple offices and administration buildings and seven soundstages. It is bounded by South Buena Vista Street on the west, West Alameda Street on the north, South Keystone Street on the east, and West Riverside Drive on the south. It sits in an area of Burbank where the street grid is offset at a diagonal, but most of the original buildings and roads within the campus itself were laid out in alignment with the [[cardinal directions]].\n\nDisney chairman Michael Eisner had the Team Disney building constructed in 1990.<ref name=\"lac\" /> In 1992, Disney had gained city approval for its expansion master plan, which included the Riverside Building.

Eisner Building ===\n[[File:Teamdisneyburbankbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Team Disney\" building]]\n\nFormerly known as the [[Team Disney Burbank]] building, Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner Building is the main building located at the Walt Disney Studios. Completed in 1990 and designed by [[Michael Graves]], the Team Disney Burbank building contains the office of Chairman and CEO [[Bob Iger|Robert A. Iger]], as well as the boardroom for the board of directors. It also houses offices for members of Senior Management, such as [[Alan Horn]], chairman of Walt Disney Studios and [[Andy Bird]], chairman of Walt Disney International. Prior to the opening of the Team Disney Burbank building in 1990, Disney executives were located in the old Animation building and the Roy O. Disney Building; the animators had been forced to relocate in 1985 into a series of warehouses, trailers, and hangars in nearby Glendale.\n\nThe Team Disney structure is sometimes called the \"Seven Dwarfs Building\". It has large sculpted [[caryatids]] of the Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof of the eastern fa\u00e7ade, an homage to the animated film [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']], which provided [[Walt Disney]] with the revenue to purchase the Burbank lot. Each statue is 19 feet (5.7 meters) tall, with the exception of the 2/3-sized Dopey at top.<ref name=lac/> The building is located opposite the [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]] building, named for Eisner's former colleague, and [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]] from 1984 to 1994. In 1996 the building was featured in [[Hollywood Pictures]] film ''[[Spy Hard]].'' On January 23, 2006, in honor of [[Michael Eisner]]'s 21-year leadership of the company, the Team Disney building was rededicated as Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner Building.\n\n=== Disney Legends Plaza ===\n[[Disney Legends]] Plaza, located between the [[Team Disney]]: The Michael D. Eisner building and the [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]] building, is the central hub for the [[Disney Legends]] award and pays homage to its recipients. Dedicated on October 18, 1998, the plaza features the [[Partners (statue)|''Partners'' statue]] of [[Walt Disney]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], designed by Imagineer Blaine Gibson, along with a replica statue of [[Roy O. Disney]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] which can also be found at the [[Magic Kingdom]] park.\n\nLocated on the pillars in the plaza are bronze plaques featuring receivers of the [[Disney Legends]] award. The plaques feature the recipient's name, reason for gaining the award, and the person's hand prints and signature if they were alive at the time they received the award. Most famously, Legendary Animator and Imagineer, [[Ward Kimball]]'s plaque features an extra finger, a reminder of Kimball's sense of humor. If, however, the award was presented posthumously, an image of the [[Disney Legends]] statue is engraved instead of the traditional hand prints and signature.\n\nThe plaza formerly featured a small fountain to honor the Legends, but that was since removed due to water leakage.\n\n=== Frank G. Wells Building ===\n[[File:Frankgwellsbuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The Frank G. Wells Building]]\nThis building is dedicated to the former [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]] from 1984 to 1994, [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]]. The building opened in 1998 and was dedicated by Wells's widow Luanne Wells, and company CEO [[Michael Eisner]].\n\nThe five-story building has a usable area of {{convert|240518|sqft|m2}} with three underground parking levels, accommodating 600 parking spaces. The construction was completed in two phases: phase I in August 1997 and phase II in July 1998.  The Frank G. Wells building was specifically designed for [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]], and the division formerly had offices located on the third floor. The division has since moved to the [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative Campus]] in nearby [[Glendale, California]].\n\nIt is distinctly recognizable through its giant movie reel and film strip on the building's exterior. The building is currently home to the Walt Disney Archives, studio mail center, [[Marvel Studios]], the [[Disney Music Group]], a screening room, various multipurpose rooms, and one of the three extant [[multiplane camera]]s (which is on display in the lobby). It was formerly home to [[Walt Disney Television]], various management offices, and the human resources department.\n\nThe Archives are located on the ground floor and are open to all cast members; they also have additional storage and restricted areas on other floors. The Studio's [[Starbucks Coffee]] shop is also located on the ground floor.\n\n=== Animation Building ===\n[[File:Oldanimationbuilding.JPG|thumb|The original Animation Building]]\nThe three-story former main building for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] was completed in 1940, based on a [[Streamline Moderne]] design by industrial designer and architect Kem Weber.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sampson|first1=Wade|title=The Studio that Walt Built|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8194/The_Studio_that_Walt_Built|website=Mouse Planet|date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> It is considered the jewel of the original studio buildings. [[Walt Disney]] personally supervised the eight-wing \"double H\" design, ensuring as many rooms as possible had windows, which allowed natural light into the building to help the animators while working. Many Disney animated features were drawn here, including ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959),  ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961), ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970), ''[[The Rescuers]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981). The animation for ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985) was the last to be completed at the site.<ref name=\"BasilSavedDisney\">{{cite web|last1=Korbis|first1=Jim|title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9534/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_One|website=Mouse Planet|date=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Animation Building initially served as the creative and administrative nucleus for the entire studio. Walt's brother [[Roy O. Disney]], who ran the company's financial operations, shared a wing with the accounting and legal departments on the first floor, which was where the animators, in-betweeners and clean-up artists worked. The D-Wing's ground floor was the longtime domain of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]], and over the years other prominent animators and artists such as [[Bill Tytla]], [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]], [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], [[Preston Blair]], [[Eyvind Earle]], [[Tyrus Wong]], [[Mary Blair]], [[Andreas Deja]], [[Floyd Norman]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Glen Keane]], [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] worked in the building. On the second floor were office suites for the directors and studios for the background and layout artists. The story department was located on the third floor, along with offices and a rehearsal room for Disney's composers and arrangers.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Korbis|first1=Jim|title=Walt Disney's Hollywood Studios|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/10903/Walt_Disneys_Hollywood_Studios|website=Mouse Planet|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSuite 3H, on the third floor of the Animation Building's H-Wing, was Walt's headquarters. The five-room space included his two adjacent offices: a \"formal\" [[corner office]] for signing contracts and meeting with important visitors, and a \"working office\" where he huddled with key staff to develop ideas for his films, television shows and theme parks. The latter had a [[kitchenette]] hidden behind wood paneling that retracted at the touch of a button, as Walt often ate lunch at his desk.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|author=Tori Avey|title=Walt Disney's Family Recipe for Cold Lemon Pie|website=[[PBS]]|date= July 15, 2015|access-date=August 21, 2016|url=https://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/walt-disney-family-recipe-cold-lemon-pie/}}</ref> Also in the suite was his secretary's office, featuring displays of his numerous awards, and a lounge area where Walt would relax after 5:00 pm with a drink (Scotch Mist was his cocktail of choice) and a back massage from the studio nurse before going home.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Korkis|title=Forgotten Disney Heroines: The Disney Secretaries|website= [[The Walt Disney Family Museum]]|date=April 27, 2011|url=http://www.waltdisney.org/blog/forgotten-disney-heroines-disney-secretaries}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Chad Garland|title=Walt Disney's Burbank office suite restored to historic glory|agency= [[The Burbank Leader]]|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 24, 2015|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-walt-disneys-burbank-office-suite-restored-to-historic-glory-20151224-story.html}}</ref> Walt's suite was closed after his death in 1966 and not reused until 1970, after his personal items had been carefully archived.

Prior to the opening of the [[Team Disney|Team Disney Burbank]] building in 1990, Disney executives used the Animation Building as corporate offices. In 1995, animation production moved back to Burbank across the street from the main studios with the opening of the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building. Today, the original Animation Building is used primarily to house offices for various film and television producers who have distribution deals with Disney. Its exterior was a primary location for the 2013 film ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]'', though the interiors (including Walt's offices) were recreated at an outside studio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Stern|title=The Filming Locations of Disney's ''Saving Mr. Banks''|website= BeyondtheMarquee.com|date=December 24, 2013|access-date=September 8, 2016|url=http://beyondthemarquee.com/27496}}</ref>\n\n=== Water Tower ===\n[[File:Disneystudiowatertower.JPG|thumb|right|Disney Studios Water Tower]]\n\nCompleted in 1939 at a cost of $300,000, the Water Tower was one of the first structures to emerge at the new Disney studio.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It stands 135.6 feet (41.3 meters) high and originally held 150,000 gallons of water.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Nancy|title=A Tour of the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA|url=http://www.disunplugged.com/2010/03/15/come-along-on-a-tour-of-the-walt-disney-studios-in-burbank-ca/|website=DIS Unplugged|date=March 15, 2010}}</ref>  Towers such as these provided an emergency water supply in case of fire and were a standard feature of major Hollywood studios of the era, examples of which can still be seen at the [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Sony Pictures Studios]] (formerly [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]) lots. Roy Disney, however, insisted that the Disney Studio's water tower be built with six legs instead of the usual four, claiming it was more aesthetically pleasing.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" />\n\nThe tower is no longer used for water storage and stands as an identifying symbol of Disney's Burbank studio. In 1984 the top portion of the holding tank was painted white and, for the first time, emblazoned with the image of [[Mickey Mouse]], the official mascot of the Walt Disney Company.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" /> It was the model for the [[Earffel Tower]] which stood at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park near Orlando, Florida from 1989 to 2016, and the replica at [[Walt Disney Studios Park]] in [[Disneyland Paris]] (2002 to the present),<ref>{{cite news|author=Dewayne Bevil|title=Disney: Earffel Tower removed at Hollywood Studios|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=April 29, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2016|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/theme-park-rangers-blog/os-disney-hollywood-studios-earffel-tower-removed-20160429-story.html}}</ref> though the original has never been decorated with Mickey Mouse ears on top.\n\n=== The Roy O. Disney Building ===\nThe Roy O. Disney building is located next to the animation building and held the office of [[Roy O. Disney]] to whom the building is dedicated. The building used to be the main administration building on the studio lot prior to the opening of the Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner building. Today, it is home to Disney's legal department.\n\n=== The Annette Funicello Stage, Stage 1 ===\nStage 1 was completed between 1939 and 1940 and is the original Disney soundstage on the Burbank lot. The soundstage was designed to replace a smaller stage at the former Hyperion Avenue Studio. Although Walt Disney Studios predominantly made animated films, the soundstage was built in order to film Leopold Stokowski's segments in the 1940 film [[Fantasia (1940 film)|''Fantasia'']]. During [[World War II]], the stage was used for repairing army vehicles. The soundstage was formerly dedicated to [[Fantasia (1940 film)|''Fantasia'']], for it being the first motion picture that was filmed in the building. The stage is the smallest on the lot at 11,000 sq ft. It features a 2400 sq ft underwater tank and is still in active use. On June 24, 2013, it was dedicated to [[Mousketeer]] [[Annette Funicello]] as it was the original shooting stage for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=DEDICATING THE ANNETTE FUNICELLO STAGE|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/articles/2013/06/25/dedicating-the-annette-funicello-stage/?cmp=SMC|work=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=Disney Insider|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Julie Andrews Stage, Stage 2 ===\nConstructed from 1947 and opening in April 1949, Stage 2 is the second oldest soundstage on the Walt Disney Studios lot, and at {{convert|31000|ft|m}}, one of the largest in Los Angeles. It was built and financed between a joint agreement between [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Jack Webb]], who used the stage for the filming of the television series ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. In October 1955, Stage 2 began production on the first series of [[The Mickey Mouse Club]]. From 1954 to 1955 and prior to the opening of the facilities at Glendale California, [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] (now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]) occupied soundstage 2 to build multiple attractions for [[Disneyland]], including the [[Mark Twain]] Riverboat. Since then Stage 2 has been used for filming of multiple attractions for [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]].\n\nDuring the filming of ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' the filmmakers discovered the 40 feet high tall stage was not tall enough to hold one of the \"asteroid\" seen in the film. The floor was removed and an additional 20 feet was dug down to accommodate the 360-degree set for the scene. In 2001, soundstage 2 was dedicated to English actress [[Julie Andrews]], because parts of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and parts of the then-current filming of ''[[The Princess Diaries]]'' took place inside this particular soundstage.\n\n=== Stage 3 ===\nStage 3 was completed in 1953 and designed especially for the film [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'']]. The stage is 19,000 sq ft and contains an operational 3600 sq ft water tank that is divided into two parts for underwater and special effects filming.\n\nThe tank area was also used heavily beginning in the 1960s as Disney pioneered the use of the [[Sodium vapor process|sodium screen process]]. In the 1970s stage 3 was equipped with the first computerized motion control system. The ACES (Animated Camera Effects System) was designed by Disney engineers and broke new ground with technology which has become one of the foundations of current special effects photography.\n\n=== Stages 4 and 5 ===\nStage 4, which was completed in 1958, was first used for ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''. Upon completing 30 years of service in 1998, Stage 4 was divided into two new television studios, creating the new Stage 4 and Stage 5. Stage 4 is known as the \"''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' stage\", as that series was filmed here from 1991 to 1999. Stage 4 is currently inhabited by ''[[Black-ish]]''.\n\n=== Stages 6 and 7 ===\nStages 6 and 7, built in 1997 are the newest soundstages at the Walt Disney Studios. These audience-rated stages provide comprehensive production support with computer-controlled access, high-volume air-conditioning, and adjoining production support building. They are built on the former back-lot and are located behind the Frank G. Wells Building. Both stages are {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} each and are in frequent use at the studios. Popular productions here have included, ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'', ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|The Muppets]]'', ''[[8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter]]'', ''[[The Geena Davis Show]]'', and [[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|''Brothers and Sisters'']].\n\n=== The Hyperion Bungalow ===\nThe [[Bungalow]] was built in 1935 as the original home of the Disney Publicity and Comic Strip Departments. It was constructed at the Disney Studios on Hyperion Avenue in Hollywood and moved to the Burbank location as part of the construction process in 1939\u20131940. At the Disney Burbank lot, the building housed many support services over the years. Payroll, Publicity Support, Traffic and finally the Post Office were located in the building. The structure is the last remaining example of the \"[[California Bungalow]]\" type architecture that remains from the Hyperion studio facility. Its attractive style and utility, dating back to the early years of the company, give it a special place in the history of the Disney lot.\n\n=== Main Theater ===\nThe 419-seat Theater,<ref>{{cite web|title=Main Theater|url=http://www.disneydigitalstudio.com/portfolio/main-theater/|publisher=Disney Digital Studio Services}}</ref> another original building on the Burbank lot, shows first-run Disney films for studio employees and guests. It has plush [[stadium seating]] and has been upgraded over the years to keep pace with new technology in the exhibition of films. Food and drink are not allowed inside.   \n  \nThroughout its history, the theater has also been used for post-production sound mixing. According to the Disney production services website, \"The Main Theater is a state-of-the-art digital sound dubbing and screening facility that was first used to mix the sound for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' [in 1940]. Sound mixers blend dialogue, music, and sound effects tracks to the various levels appropriate for a movie theater. The acoustics are designed to simulate a theater that is three-quarters full. Although the theater is empty during the mixing session, extra padding in the seats and specially designed walls absorb and reflect the sound. This helps the sound mixers to know what the final product will sound like when it is released to the public.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios - History|url=https://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/history.html|publisher=Disney Studio Services}}</ref>\n\nThe signage above the entrance says simply \"Theatre\". The name \"Main Theater\" is used to distinguish the venue from several smaller screening rooms situated throughout the studio. In Walt's era these were called \"sweatboxes\", where animation test reels and the daily rushes of his live-action features were shown for his approval.<ref>Leonard Maltin, \"Of Mice and Magic\", Plume, Revised & Updated edition, 1987, pp. 55 and 58.</ref><ref>The colloquialism \"Sweatbox\" was carried over from the screening room at Disney's former Hyperion studio. See Maltin, \"Of Mice and Magic\" (1987), p. 55.</ref>\n\n=== Ink and Paint Building ===\nThe 1940 Ink and Paint Building was where animators' drawings were inked onto transparent cels and then the cels were painted. It was built with high ceilings and a sophisticated central ventilation system so that the staff members would not be overcome by toxic paint fumes. One section was used as a special paint-mixing laboratory to provide Disney cartoons with the widest possible spectrum of colors. Three interior courtyards provided northern light for the artists and also served as outdoor break areas. It was a self-contained structure with its own cafeteria, lounge, and rooftop sundeck.<ref>Garity and Ledeen, \"The New Walt Disney Studio\", p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe sequestered layout reflected workplace attitudes of the era. As was common in the American animation industry of Disney's day, the Ink and Paint departments were staffed exclusively by women. In the early 1940s Disney employed over 100 \"ink and paint girls\" at a starting salary of $18 a week, as opposed to $300 a week for experienced animators. A Disney employment brochure of the time stated: \"Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men...The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with India ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with paint according to directions.\"<ref name=\"LookCloserWomeninDisneyInkandPaintDept\">{{cite web |url= http://www.waltdisney.org/blog/look-closer-women-disney-ink-and-paint-department|title= Look Closer: Women in the Disney Ink and Paint Department|author= Mary Beth Culler|date= April 6, 2012|website= The Walt Disney Family Museum|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Men and women at the Disney studio were not encouraged to fraternize, and the cloistered atmosphere of the Ink and Paint Building led wags on the lot to call it \"The Nunnery.\"<ref name=\"LookCloserWomeninDisneyInkandPaintDept\" /><ref>Walt Disney met his wife [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]] when he hired her as an ink & paint girl in 1924.</ref>\n\nThe basement of the Ink and Paint Building was the location of Disney's famous \"Morgue\",<ref>In Disney's time \"morgue\" was also a journalistic term for a repository of old newspaper copy that could be referenced in the future, and it was in this spirit that he named his archives.

The last Disney animated feature to employ inked and painted cels was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite web|author=Kristen McCormick and Michael R.

Unique original features were the \"de-dusting chambers\" that personnel, painted cels and other materials had to pass through before entering, so no trace of dust or lint would show up in the photography.<ref name=\"auto2\">Garity and Ledeen, \"The New Walt Disney Studio\", p. 18.</ref> In 1941 it housed two [[multiplane camera]]s, each standing 12 feet (3.6 meters) high and occupying its own room, and two conventional camera set-ups.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> A third multiplane camera was subsequently constructed.\n\nSince 1990 the Camera Building has been occupied by what is now Buena Vista Imaging, which provides photo-optical and digital imaging services for films and television.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios - History: Imaging|url=https://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/history.html|publisher=Disney Studio Services}}</ref>\n\n=== Cutting Building ===\nAnother original site on the Burbank lot, it is the longtime home of Disney's editing facilities. The building's name derives from the traditional method of physically cutting and splicing films shot on nitrate and (after 1952) safety stock. Today it employs [[video editing]] techniques.\n\n=== Shorts Building ===\n[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12)|A 1937 image of [[Walt Disney]] (with figurines of the Seven Dwarfs) in his office at the former Hyperion studio. The office later became part of the Shorts Building on the Burbank lot]]\n\nThe two-story Shorts Building is one of the most significant remnants of Disney's former Hyperion studio. It originally consisted of two buildings, constructed in 1934 and 1937, to accommodate the company's rapidly expanding animation department. The 1934 structure was called the \"Animation Building No. 2\" and Walt and Roy Disney had their offices there prior to the move to Burbank.<ref name=\"auto\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Floyd B.

(The window of Walt's old second-floor office can be seen directly above the dock).<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" /> The colloquial name \"Shorts Building\" was apparently a nod to its historical past, as no further animation would be done on the premises. Since its relocation the building has served the studio in support capacities, housing the publicity, comic strip, foreign relations, hair and makeup, and wardrobe fitting departments. The lot's Studio Operations department is now located here.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" />\n\n===The Roy E. Disney Animation Building===\n[[File:Roy E. Disney Animation Building.jpg|thumb|Roy E. Disney Animation Building]]\n\nFormerly known as the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] Building, the [[Roy E. Disney]] building is the current home of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], which sits to the south across [[Riverside Drive (Los Angeles, California)|Riverside Drive]]. It was designed by the firm [[Robert A.M. Stern Architects]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Gardner|title=Roy E. Disney Animation Building Getting a Makeover|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 22, 2014|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roy-e-disney-animation-building-750508}}</ref> Construction was completed in 1994.\n\nAs noted above, in 1985, Disney Animation was moved out of the studio lot and into a cluster of old buildings in Glendale. During Michael Eisner's 1986 restructuring of The Walt Disney Company, the studio's animation division was spun off to officially create Walt Disney Feature Animation as a separate subsidiary of the company, and in 1995 it came back to Burbank when its new home opened.\n\nThe new studio is a colorful architectural landmark, adorned by a giant version of the Fantasia Sorcerer's hat, which once housed the office of Roy Disney, former head of Walt Disney Animation Studios. It also displays the word \"ANIMATION\" on giant letters on its south side to passersby on the [[Ventura Freeway]].\n\nIn 2009, following the death of Roy Disney, the building was renamed and rededicated in his honor by Disney president and CEO, Bob Iger.\n\n===ABC Studios Building===\n[[File:Disney studios burbank abc building riverside.jpg|thumb|upright|The ABC Studios building on the Walt Disney Studios Riverside Drive property in Burbank, California. The blue pedestrian overpass seen in the lower left connects it to the larger Buena Vista lot.]]\n\nAfter Disney's purchase of ABC in 1996, a new headquarters for the television network was constructed across Riverside Drive next to the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building. The ABC building was designed by Aldo Rossi and is connected to the lot by a blue serpentine bridge that crosses over Riverside Drive. The ABC building also houses the offices of other subsidiaries such as [[ABC Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].\n\n=== Digital Studio Center ===\nA two-story 17,000 square foot facility dedicated to post-production utilities and other, similar technical services. Opened in December 2012, the center is the home of Disney Digital Studio Services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tipton|first=Janelle|title=Digital Studio Center Debuts at The Walt Disney Studios|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/blog/digital-studio-center-debuts-walt-disney-studios|work=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=The Disney Post|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Original Commissary===\nThis private cafeteria and grill opened in 1940 as Walt Disney's Studio Restaurant, and is now named the Buena Vista Caf\u00e9. Along with Stage 1, the Cutting Building, and the Main Theater, it is one of the few original buildings on the Burbank lot still serving its initial purpose. The commissary offers breakfast and lunch options for studio employees and guests, with indoor and outdoor seating. It once had an executive dining area called the Coral Room where Walt Disney occasionally lunched. The site was extensively remodeled in 2011, but Walt's favorite dish, [[chili con carne|chili]] served with [[Saltine cracker|crackers]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Korkis|title=Eating Like Walt Disney|website=Mouse Planet|date= August 31, 2011|access-date=August 21, 2016|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9723/Eating_Like_Walt_Disney}}</ref> remains on the menu. Buena Vista Caf\u00e9 is currently open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The grill shuts down at 2:30 PM; pre-packaged foods, snacks and beverages can be purchased until closing time.\n\nThere is a newer commissary at the ABC Studios Building, across from the main Disney lot on Riverside Drive in Burbank.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Los Angeles}}\n*''[[A Trip Through the Walt Disney Studios]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/index.html Walt Disney Studios website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121130174512/http://cinchset.com/hickory.html ''A look at the history of Walt Disney studios Burbank back lot as used for Follow Me Boys! and other films.'']\n\n{{Disney}}\n{{Walt Disney Studios}}\n{{Burbank, California}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:American film studios]]\n[[Category:Backlot sets]]\n[[Category:Disney production studios]]\n[[Category:Media company headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:The Walt Disney Studios]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Burbank, California]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1940]]\n[[Category:1940 establishments in California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{Lead rewrite|reason=Mucho tourism, no history|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox business park\n| name              = Walt Disney Studios\n| image             = Walt_Disney_Studios_Alameda_Entrance.jpg\n| image_upright     = \n| alt               = \n| caption           = Main entrance to The Walt Disney Studios\n| map_type          = \n| relief            = \n| map_size          = \n| map_dot_label     = \n| map_alt           = \n| map_caption       = \n| location          = \n| address           = \n| coordinates       = {{Coord|34|09|25|N|118|19|30|W|display=title}}\n| opening_date      = {{start date and age|1940|2|23}}\n| closing_date      = \n| developer         = \n| construction_cost = \n| manager           = {{Plainlist|\n* Disney Studio Services (production)\n* Disney Worldwide Services\n}}\n| owner             = Disney Worldwide Services<br>([[The Walt Disney Company]])\n| architect         = \n| number_of_tenants = \n| number_of_workers = \n| size              = {{convert|51|acres}} \n| parking           = \n| website           = \n| footnotes         = \n}}\n\nThe '''Walt Disney Studios''', in [[Burbank, California]], United States, serves as the [[corporate headquarters]] for [[The Walt Disney Company]] media conglomerate.

During summer 1923, [[Walt Disney]] created \"The Disney Bros. Cartoon Studio\" in his uncle Robert Disney's garage, which was located at 4406 Kingswell Avenue, in the [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]] neighborhood of Los Angeles (just east of Hollywood). This garage has been on display at the Stanley Ranch Museum in Garden Grove since the 1980s, several blocks away from Disneyland.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Garden Grove Historical Society|url=http://www.ci.garden-grove.ca.us/HistoricalSociety|website=City of Garden Grove|accessdate=August 7, 2015}}</ref> His brother [[Roy O. Disney]] was also in Los Angeles at the time. During October 1923, the brothers leased office space on the rear side of a real estate agency's office at 4651 Kingswell Avenue. On October 16, 1923, Walt Disney accepted an offer from [[Margaret Winkler]] of [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] to distribute the new [[Alice Comedies]] starring [[Virginia Davis]]. It was also at this site where on January 14, 1924, [[Walt Disney]] met his future wife [[Lillian Bounds]], an \"ink and paint\" girl whom he personally hired. In February 1924, the studio moved next door to an office of its own at 4649 Kingswell Avenue. The late Robert Disney's residence and the small office building that is home to 4649 and 4651 Kingswell Avenue have survived to the present and are still in use.\n\nIn 1925, [[Walt Disney]] placed a deposit on a new, considerably larger lot at 2719 Hyperion Avenue, and the studio moved there in January 1926. It was here where, after a train journey with his wife Lillian, Walt fully created the character of [[Mickey Mouse]] in 1928. Here, too, the first color animated film, the ''[[Silly Symphony]]'' ''[[Flowers and Trees]]'', and the first animated cartoon using the [[multiplane camera]], ''[[The Old Mill]]'', were created. In 1937, the Hyperion studio produced the world's first full-length animated feature film, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']]. Disney's staff began to grow to a substantial size at the Hyperion studio, and [[Disney Legends]] such as [[Disney's Nine Old Men]] began their careers there. The Hyperion studio site was sold in 1940 and divided between two different industrial manufacturers, and in 1966 a subsequent owner demolished what was left of the studio complex and replaced it with the supermarket and shopping center that stand there today. To honor the company's former headquarters from 1926 to 1940, the name 'Hyperion' has been reused over the years by the Walt Disney Company for multiple divisions and attractions, including [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]] and the [[Hyperion Theater]] at [[Disney California Adventure Park]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Disney studios burbank entrance gate buena vista.jpg|thumb|The original entrance gate to Walt Disney Studios at 500 South Buena Vista Street in Burbank, California.]]\n\nThe current Walt Disney Studios, located at 500 South [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] Street, [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], was made possible by the revenue from the 1937 release of [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']].<ref name=\"lac\">{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Studios|url=https://www.laconservancy.org/locations/walt-disney-studios|website=Los Angeles Conservancy|accessdate=October 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref> [[Walt Disney]] and his staff began the move from the old studio at Hyperion Avenue in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] from December 1939 to January 1940. Designed primarily by [[Kem Weber]] under the supervision of [[Walt Disney]] and his brother Roy, the [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] Disney Studio buildings are the only studios that have been owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] to survive from the Golden Age of filming.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} A bungalow, the Shorts building and other small buildings that were located at the Hyperion Avenue location were moved to Burbank.<ref name=\"ut\" />\n\nDisney purposely planned his new Burbank studio around the animation process. The large Animation Building stood in the center of the campus, while adjacent outlying buildings were constructed for the ink-and-paint departments, the camera and editing departments, and the other various functions of the studio. Tunnels linked some of the buildings (to allow movement of animation materials without exposing them to the elements), and the lot also included a movie theatre, a [[sound stage]], and a commissary. The 1941 Disney feature [[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|''The Reluctant Dragon'']], which combined live action with animated sequences and starred [[Robert Benchley]], served as a tour of the then-new studio. It was later frequently seen and toured on the various Disney television programs.\n\nAfter the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Oahu]] by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] on December 7, 1941, at least 500 [[United States Army]] personnel occupied Walt Disney Studios the next day for eight months during [[World War II]] in the period of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] [[Invasion of the United States|invasion scare]] in the few months of American entry into the war. During the war, Disney [[Walt Disney's World War II propaganda production|regularly produced propaganda and training films]] for the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] including [[United States Armed Forces|its armed forces]] to increase morale among Americans that the fight against the [[Axis powers]] was waged for a just cause.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/featured/2015/12/07/pearl-harbor-changed-everything-even-disney-studio/|first=Doobie|last=Moseley|date=December 7, 2015|title=Pearl Harbor Changed Everything, Even the Disney Studio|publisher=Laughing Place}}</ref>\n\nIn the years after the war, the studio began regular work on live-action features, as they needed the money. Though their first films were shot in England, the necessity to build live-action facilities still arose. Lacking the capital to do it themselves, Jack Webb offered to put up some of the money to build live-action soundstages in exchange for the right to use them (Webb used them to shoot much of the ''Dragnet'' TV series). During this time, backlots for exterior shots were also built and remained standing at the studios until after a major change in management in 1984.\n\nIn 1986, after the corporate restructuring of Walt Disney Productions into The Walt Disney Company, the studio lot was remodeled to accommodate more live-action production space and administrative offices. The studio lot is now home to multiple offices and administration buildings and seven soundstages. It is bounded by South Buena Vista Street on the west, West Alameda Street on the north, South Keystone Street on the east, and West Riverside Drive on the south. It sits in an area of Burbank where the street grid is offset at a diagonal, but most of the original buildings and roads within the campus itself were laid out in alignment with the [[cardinal directions]].\n\nDisney chairman Michael Eisner had the Team Disney building constructed in 1990.<ref name=\"lac\" /> In 1992, Disney had gained city approval for its expansion master plan, which included the Riverside Building.

Eisner Building ===\n[[File:Teamdisneyburbankbuilding.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Team Disney\" building]]\n\nFormerly known as the [[Team Disney Burbank]] building, Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner Building is the main building located at the Walt Disney Studios. Completed in 1990 and designed by [[Michael Graves]], the Team Disney Burbank building contains the office of Chairman and CEO [[Bob Iger|Robert A. Iger]], as well as the boardroom for the board of directors. It also houses offices for members of Senior Management, such as [[Alan Horn]], chairman of Walt Disney Studios and [[Andy Bird]], chairman of Walt Disney International. Prior to the opening of the Team Disney Burbank building in 1990, Disney executives were located in the old Animation building and the Roy O. Disney Building; the animators had been forced to relocate in 1985 into a series of warehouses, trailers, and hangars in nearby Glendale.\n\nThe Team Disney structure is sometimes called the \"Seven Dwarfs Building\". It has large sculpted [[caryatids]] of the Seven Dwarfs holding up the roof of the eastern fa\u00e7ade, an homage to the animated film [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']], which provided [[Walt Disney]] with the revenue to purchase the Burbank lot. Each statue is 19 feet (5.7 meters) tall, with the exception of the 2/3-sized Dopey at top.<ref name=lac/> The building is located opposite the [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]] building, named for Eisner's former colleague, and [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]] from 1984 to 1994. In 1996 the building was featured in [[Hollywood Pictures]] film ''[[Spy Hard]].''On January 23, 2006, in honor of [[Michael Eisner]]'s 21-year leadership of the company, the Team Disney building was rededicated as Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner Building.\n\n=== Disney Legends Plaza ===\n[[Disney Legends]] Plaza, located between the [[Team Disney]]: The Michael D. Eisner building and the [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]] building, is the central hub for the [[Disney Legends]] award and pays homage to its recipients. Dedicated on October 18, 1998, the plaza features the [[Partners (statue)|''Partners'' statue]] of [[Walt Disney]] and [[Mickey Mouse]], designed by Imagineer Blaine Gibson, along with a replica statue of [[Roy O. Disney]] and [[Minnie Mouse]] which can also be found at the [[Magic Kingdom]] park.\n\nLocated on the pillars in the plaza are bronze plaques featuring receivers of the [[Disney Legends]] award. The plaques feature the recipient's name, reason for gaining the award, and the person's hand prints and signature if they were alive at the time they received the award. Most famously, Legendary Animator and Imagineer, [[Ward Kimball]]'s plaque features an extra finger, a reminder of Kimball's sense of humor. If, however, the award was presented posthumously, an image of the [[Disney Legends]] statue is engraved instead of the traditional hand prints and signature.\n\nThe plaza formerly featured a small fountain to honor the Legends, but that was since removed due to water leakage.\n\n=== Frank G. Wells Building ===\n[[File:Frankgwellsbuilding.JPG|thumb|right|The Frank G. Wells Building]]\nThis building is dedicated to the former [[President (corporate title)|President]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]] from 1984 to 1994, [[Frank Wells|Frank G. Wells]]. The building opened in 1998 and was dedicated by Wells's widow Luanne Wells, and company CEO [[Michael Eisner]].\n\nThe five-story building has a usable area of {{convert|240518|sqft|m2}} with three underground parking levels, accommodating 600 parking spaces. The construction was completed in two phases: phase I in August 1997 and phase II in July 1998.  The Frank G. Wells building was specifically designed for [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]], and the division formerly had offices located on the third floor. The division has since moved to the [[Grand Central Airport (California)#Grand Central Creative Campus|Grand Central Creative Campus]] in nearby [[Glendale, California]].\n\nIt is distinctly recognizable through its giant movie reel and film strip on the building's exterior. The building is currently home to the Walt Disney Archives, studio mail center, [[Marvel Studios]], the [[Disney Music Group]], a screening room, various multipurpose rooms, and one of the three extant [[multiplane camera]]s (which is on display in the lobby). It was formerly home to [[Walt Disney Television]], various management offices, and the human resources department.\n\nThe Archives are located on the ground floor and are open to all cast members; they also have additional storage and restricted areas on other floors. The Studio's [[Starbucks Coffee]] shop is also located on the ground floor.\n\n=== Animation Building ===\n[[File:Oldanimationbuilding.JPG|thumb|The original Animation Building]]\nThe three-story former main building for [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] was completed in 1940, based on a [[Streamline Moderne]] design by industrial designer and architect Kem Weber.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sampson|first1=Wade|title=The Studio that Walt Built|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/8194/The_Studio_that_Walt_Built|website=Mouse Planet|date=May 9, 2007}}</ref> It is considered the jewel of the original studio buildings. [[Walt Disney]] personally supervised the eight-wing \"double H\" design, ensuring as many rooms as possible had windows, which allowed natural light into the building to help the animators while working. Many Disney animated features were drawn here, including ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942), ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959),  ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961), ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' (1967), ''[[The Aristocats]]'' (1970), ''[[The Rescuers]]'' (1977), and ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981). The animation for ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985) was the last to be completed at the site.<ref name=\"BasilSavedDisney\">{{cite web|last1=Korbis|first1=Jim|title=How Basil Saved Disney Feature Animation: Part One|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9534/How_Basil_Saved_Disney_Feature_Animation_Part_One|website=Mouse Planet|date=February 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Animation Building initially served as the creative and administrative nucleus for the entire studio. Walt's brother [[Roy O. Disney]], who ran the company's financial operations, shared a wing with the accounting and legal departments on the first floor, which was where the animators, in-betweeners and clean-up artists worked. The D-Wing's ground floor was the longtime domain of [[Disney's Nine Old Men]], and over the years other prominent animators and artists such as [[Bill Tytla]], [[Fred Moore (animator)|Fred Moore]], [[Norm Ferguson (animator)|Norm Ferguson]], [[Preston Blair]], [[Eyvind Earle]], [[Tyrus Wong]], [[Mary Blair]], [[Andreas Deja]], [[Floyd Norman]], [[John Lasseter]], [[Glen Keane]], [[John Musker]] and [[Ron Clements]] worked in the building. On the second floor were office suites for the directors and studios for the background and layout artists. The story department was located on the third floor, along with offices and a rehearsal room for Disney's composers and arrangers.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|last1=Korbis|first1=Jim|title=Walt Disney's Hollywood Studios|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/10903/Walt_Disneys_Hollywood_Studios|website=Mouse Planet|date=January 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSuite 3H, on the third floor of the Animation Building's H-Wing, was Walt's headquarters. The five-room space included his two adjacent offices: a \"formal\" [[corner office]] for signing contracts and meeting with important visitors, and a \"working office\" where he huddled with key staff to develop ideas for his films, television shows and theme parks. The latter had a [[kitchenette]] hidden behind wood paneling that retracted at the touch of a button, as Walt often ate lunch at his desk.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|author=Tori Avey|title=Walt Disney's Family Recipe for Cold Lemon Pie|website=[[PBS]]|date= July 15, 2015|access-date=August 21, 2016|url=https://www.pbs.org/food/the-history-kitchen/walt-disney-family-recipe-cold-lemon-pie/}}</ref> Also in the suite was his secretary's office, featuring displays of his numerous awards, and a lounge area where Walt would relax after 5:00 pm with a drink (Scotch Mist was his cocktail of choice) and a back massage from the studio nurse before going home.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Korkis|title=Forgotten Disney Heroines: The Disney Secretaries|website= [[The Walt Disney Family Museum]]|date=April 27, 2011|url=http://www.waltdisney.org/blog/forgotten-disney-heroines-disney-secretaries}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Chad Garland|title=Walt Disney's Burbank office suite restored to historic glory|agency= [[The Burbank Leader]]|work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|date= December 24, 2015|url=http://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/news/tn-blr-walt-disneys-burbank-office-suite-restored-to-historic-glory-20151224-story.html}}</ref> Walt's suite was closed after his death in 1966 and not reused until 1970, after his personal items had been carefully archived. Over the years these items were used in museum exhibits recreating his offices, primarily at Disney resorts. In 2015, under the auspices of the Walt Disney Archives, Suite 3H was restored as closely as possible to the condition in which Walt left it, with many of the original furnishings and objects. Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger dedicated the restoration on December 7 of that year.

Prior to the opening of the [[Team Disney|Team Disney Burbank]] building in 1990, Disney executives used the Animation Building as corporate offices. In 1995, animation production moved back to Burbank across the street from the main studios with the opening of the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building. Today, the original Animation Building is used primarily to house offices for various film and television producers who have distribution deals with Disney. Its exterior was a primary location for the 2013 film ''[[Saving Mr. Banks]]'', though the interiors (including Walt's offices) were recreated at an outside studio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kevin Stern|title=The Filming Locations of Disney's ''Saving Mr. Banks''|website= BeyondtheMarquee.com|date=December 24, 2013|access-date=September 8, 2016|url=http://beyondthemarquee.com/27496}}</ref>\n\n=== Water Tower ===\n[[File:Disneystudiowatertower.JPG|thumb|right|Disney Studios Water Tower]]\n\nCompleted in 1939 at a cost of $300,000, the Water Tower was one of the first structures to emerge at the new Disney studio.<ref name=\"auto\"/> It stands 135.6 feet (41.3 meters) high and originally held 150,000 gallons of water.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Nancy|title=A Tour of the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, CA|url=http://www.disunplugged.com/2010/03/15/come-along-on-a-tour-of-the-walt-disney-studios-in-burbank-ca/|website=DIS Unplugged|date=March 15, 2010}}</ref>  Towers such as these provided an emergency water supply in case of fire and were a standard feature of major Hollywood studios of the era, examples of which can still be seen at the [[Warner Bros.]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] and [[Sony Pictures Studios]] (formerly [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]) lots.

Disney Building ===\nThe Roy O. Disney building is located next to the animation building and held the office of [[Roy O. Disney]] to whom the building is dedicated. The building used to be the main administration building on the studio lot prior to the opening of the Team Disney \u2013 The Michael D. Eisner building. Today, it is home to Disney's legal department.\n\n=== The Annette Funicello Stage, Stage 1 ===\nStage 1 was completed between 1939 and 1940 and is the original Disney soundstage on the Burbank lot. The soundstage was designed to replace a smaller stage at the former Hyperion Avenue Studio. Although Walt Disney Studios predominantly made animated films, the soundstage was built in order to film Leopold Stokowski's segments in the 1940 film [[Fantasia (1940 film)|''Fantasia'']]. During [[World War II]], the stage was used for repairing army vehicles. The soundstage was formerly dedicated to [[Fantasia (1940 film)|''Fantasia'']], for it being the first motion picture that was filmed in the building. The stage is the smallest on the lot at 11,000 sq ft. It features a 2400 sq ft underwater tank and is still in active use. On June 24, 2013, it was dedicated to [[Mousketeer]] [[Annette Funicello]] as it was the original shooting stage for ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=DEDICATING THE ANNETTE FUNICELLO STAGE|url=http://blogs.disney.com/insider/articles/2013/06/25/dedicating-the-annette-funicello-stage/?cmp=SMC|work=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=Disney Insider|accessdate=June 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Julie Andrews Stage, Stage 2 ===\nConstructed from 1947 and opening in April 1949, Stage 2 is the second oldest soundstage on the Walt Disney Studios lot, and at {{convert|31000|ft|m}}, one of the largest in Los Angeles. It was built and financed between a joint agreement between [[Walt Disney]] and director [[Jack Webb]], who used the stage for the filming of the television series ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. In October 1955, Stage 2 began production on the first series of [[The Mickey Mouse Club]]. From 1954 to 1955 and prior to the opening of the facilities at Glendale California, [[Walt Disney Imagineering|WED Enterprises]] (now [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]) occupied soundstage 2 to build multiple attractions for [[Disneyland]], including the [[Mark Twain]] Riverboat. Since then Stage 2 has been used for filming of multiple attractions for [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]].\n\nDuring the filming of ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' the filmmakers discovered the 40 feet high tall stage was not tall enough to hold one of the \"asteroid\" seen in the film. The floor was removed and an additional 20 feet was dug down to accommodate the 360-degree set for the scene. In 2001, soundstage 2 was dedicated to English actress [[Julie Andrews]], because parts of ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and parts of the then-current filming of ''[[The Princess Diaries]]'' took place inside this particular soundstage.\n\n=== Stage 3 ===\nStage 3 was completed in 1953 and designed especially for the film [[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|''20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'']]. The stage is 19,000 sq ft and contains an operational 3600 sq ft water tank that is divided into two parts for underwater and special effects filming.\n\nThe tank area was also used heavily beginning in the 1960s as Disney pioneered the use of the [[Sodium vapor process|sodium screen process]]. In the 1970s stage 3 was equipped with the first computerized motion control system. The ACES (Animated Camera Effects System) was designed by Disney engineers and broke new ground with technology which has become one of the foundations of current special effects photography.\n\n=== Stages 4 and 5 ===\nStage 4, which was completed in 1958, was first used for ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]''. Upon completing 30 years of service in 1998, Stage 4 was divided into two new television studios, creating the new Stage 4 and Stage 5. Stage 4 is known as the \"''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' stage\", as that series was filmed here from 1991 to 1999. Stage 4 is currently inhabited by ''[[Black-ish]]''.\n\n=== Stages 6 and 7 ===\nStages 6 and 7, built in 1997 are the newest soundstages at the Walt Disney Studios. These audience-rated stages provide comprehensive production support with computer-controlled access, high-volume air-conditioning, and adjoining production support building. They are built on the former back-lot and are located behind the Frank G. Wells Building. Both stages are {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} each and are in frequent use at the studios. Popular productions here have included, ''[[My Wife and Kids]]'', ''[[The Muppets (TV series)|The Muppets]]'', ''[[8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter]]'', ''[[The Geena Davis Show]]'', and [[Brothers & Sisters (2006 TV series)|''Brothers and Sisters'']].\n\n=== The Hyperion Bungalow ===\nThe [[Bungalow]] was built in 1935 as the original home of the Disney Publicity and Comic Strip Departments. It was constructed at the Disney Studios on Hyperion Avenue in Hollywood and moved to the Burbank location as part of the construction process in 1939\u20131940. At the Disney Burbank lot, the building housed many support services over the years. Payroll, Publicity Support, Traffic and finally the Post Office were located in the building. The structure is the last remaining example of the \"[[California Bungalow]]\" type architecture that remains from the Hyperion studio facility. Its attractive style and utility, dating back to the early years of the company, give it a special place in the history of the Disney lot.\n\n=== Main Theater ===\nThe 419-seat Theater,<ref>{{cite web|title=Main Theater|url=http://www.disneydigitalstudio.com/portfolio/main-theater/|publisher=Disney Digital Studio Services}}</ref> another original building on the Burbank lot, shows first-run Disney films for studio employees and guests. It has plush [[stadium seating]] and has been upgraded over the years to keep pace with new technology in the exhibition of films. Food and drink are not allowed inside.   \n  \nThroughout its history, the theater has also been used for post-production sound mixing. According to the Disney production services website, \"The Main Theater is a state-of-the-art digital sound dubbing and screening facility that was first used to mix the sound for ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' [in 1940]. Sound mixers blend dialogue, music, and sound effects tracks to the various levels appropriate for a movie theater. The acoustics are designed to simulate a theater that is three-quarters full. Although the theater is empty during the mixing session, extra padding in the seats and specially designed walls absorb and reflect the sound. This helps the sound mixers to know what the final product will sound like when it is released to the public.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios - History|url=https://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/history.html|publisher=Disney Studio Services}}</ref>\n\nThe signage above the entrance says simply \"Theatre\". The name \"Main Theater\" is used to distinguish the venue from several smaller screening rooms situated throughout the studio. In Walt's era these were called \"sweatboxes\", where animation test reels and the daily rushes of his live-action features were shown for his approval.<ref>Leonard Maltin, \"Of Mice and Magic\", Plume, Revised & Updated edition, 1987, pp. 55 and 58.</ref><ref>The colloquialism \"Sweatbox\" was carried over from the screening room at Disney's former Hyperion studio. See Maltin, \"Of Mice and Magic\" (1987), p. 55.</ref>\n\n=== Ink and Paint Building ===\nThe 1940 Ink and Paint Building was where animators' drawings were inked onto transparent cels and then the cels were painted. It was built with high ceilings and a sophisticated central ventilation system so that the staff members would not be overcome by toxic paint fumes. One section was used as a special paint-mixing laboratory to provide Disney cartoons with the widest possible spectrum of colors. Three interior courtyards provided northern light for the artists and also served as outdoor break areas. It was a self-contained structure with its own cafeteria, lounge, and rooftop sundeck.<ref>Garity and Ledeen, \"The New Walt Disney Studio\", p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe sequestered layout reflected workplace attitudes of the era. As was common in the American animation industry of Disney's day, the Ink and Paint departments were staffed exclusively by women. In the early 1940s Disney employed over 100 \"ink and paint girls\" at a starting salary of $18 a week, as opposed to $300 a week for experienced animators. A Disney employment brochure of the time stated: \"Women do not do any of the creative work in connection with preparing the cartoons for the screen, as that work is performed entirely by young men...The only work open to women consists of tracing the characters on clear celluloid sheets with India ink and filling in the tracings on the reverse side with paint according to directions.\"<ref name=\"LookCloserWomeninDisneyInkandPaintDept\">{{cite web |url= http://www.waltdisney.org/blog/look-closer-women-disney-ink-and-paint-department|title= Look Closer: Women in the Disney Ink and Paint Department|author= Mary Beth Culler|date= April 6, 2012|website= The Walt Disney Family Museum|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Men and women at the Disney studio were not encouraged to fraternize, and the cloistered atmosphere of the Ink and Paint Building led wags on the lot to call it \"The Nunnery.\"<ref name=\"LookCloserWomeninDisneyInkandPaintDept\" /><ref>Walt Disney met his wife [[Lillian Disney|Lillian]] when he hired her as an ink & paint girl in 1924.</ref>\n\nThe basement of the Ink and Paint Building was the location of Disney's famous \"Morgue\",<ref>In Disney's time \"morgue\" was also a journalistic term for a repository of old newspaper copy that could be referenced in the future, and it was in this spirit that he named his archives.

The last Disney animated feature to employ inked and painted cels was ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989).<ref>{{cite web|author=Kristen McCormick and Michael R.

Unique original features were the \"de-dusting chambers\" that personnel, painted cels and other materials had to pass through before entering, so no trace of dust or lint would show up in the photography.<ref name=\"auto2\">Garity and Ledeen, \"The New Walt Disney Studio\", p. 18.</ref> In 1941 it housed two [[multiplane camera]]s, each standing 12 feet (3.6 meters) high and occupying its own room, and two conventional camera set-ups.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> A third multiplane camera was subsequently constructed.\n\nSince 1990 the Camera Building has been occupied by what is now Buena Vista Imaging, which provides photo-optical and digital imaging services for films and television.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios - History: Imaging|url=https://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/history.html|publisher=Disney Studio Services}}</ref>\n\n=== Cutting Building ===\nAnother original site on the Burbank lot, it is the longtime home of Disney's editing facilities. The building's name derives from the traditional method of physically cutting and splicing films shot on nitrate and (after 1952) safety stock. Today it employs [[video editing]] techniques.\n\n=== Shorts Building ===\n[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12)|A 1937 image of [[Walt Disney]] (with figurines of the Seven Dwarfs) in his office at the former Hyperion studio. The office later became part of the Shorts Building on the Burbank lot]]\n\nThe two-story Shorts Building is one of the most significant remnants of Disney's former Hyperion studio. It originally consisted of two buildings, constructed in 1934 and 1937, to accommodate the company's rapidly expanding animation department. The 1934 structure was called the \"Animation Building No. 2\" and Walt and Roy Disney had their offices there prior to the move to Burbank.<ref name=\"auto\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=Floyd B. Bariscale|title=Site of First Official Walt Disney Studio and Animation School|website=Big Orange Landmarks|date=July 19, 2008|access-date=August 18, 2016|url=http://bigorangelandmarks.blogspot.com/2008/07/no-163-site-of-first-official-walt.html}}</ref> The animation for scores of Disney shorts of the 1930s, including ''[[The Band Concert]]'' (1935) and the Oscar-winning ''[[The Old Mill]]'' (1937), was created in this complex, and it was here that Walt hatched his risky idea for America's first full-length animated feature, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937).\n\nIn 1939 the two buildings were disassembled, transported to Disney's new Burbank lot, and reconstructed as a single T-shaped edifice, with the addition of a loading dock. (The window of Walt's old second-floor office can be seen directly above the dock).<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" /> The colloquial name \"Shorts Building\" was apparently a nod to its historical past, as no further animation would be done on the premises. Since its relocation the building has served the studio in support capacities, housing the publicity, comic strip, foreign relations, hair and makeup, and wardrobe fitting departments. The lot's Studio Operations department is now located here.<ref name=\"DisneyStudiosTour\" />\n\n===The Roy E. Disney Animation Building===\n[[File:Roy E. Disney Animation Building.jpg|thumb|Roy E. Disney Animation Building]]\n\nFormerly known as the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] Building, the [[Roy E. Disney]] building is the current home of [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]], which sits to the south across [[Riverside Drive (Los Angeles, California)|Riverside Drive]]. It was designed by the firm [[Robert A.M. Stern Architects]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Gardner|title=Roy E. Disney Animation Building Getting a Makeover|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=November 22, 2014|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/roy-e-disney-animation-building-750508}}</ref> Construction was completed in 1994.\n\nAs noted above, in 1985, Disney Animation was moved out of the studio lot and into a cluster of old buildings in Glendale. During Michael Eisner's 1986 restructuring of The Walt Disney Company, the studio's animation division was spun off to officially create Walt Disney Feature Animation as a separate subsidiary of the company, and in 1995 it came back to Burbank when its new home opened.\n\nThe new studio is a colorful architectural landmark, adorned by a giant version of the Fantasia Sorcerer's hat, which once housed the office of Roy Disney, former head of Walt Disney Animation Studios. It also displays the word \"ANIMATION\" on giant letters on its south side to passersby on the [[Ventura Freeway]].\n\nIn 2009, following the death of Roy Disney, the building was renamed and rededicated in his honor by Disney president and CEO, Bob Iger.\n\n===ABC Studios Building===\n[[File:Disney studios burbank abc building riverside.jpg|thumb|upright|The ABC Studios building on the Walt Disney Studios Riverside Drive property in Burbank, California. The blue pedestrian overpass seen in the lower left connects it to the larger Buena Vista lot.]]\n\nAfter Disney's purchase of ABC in 1996, a new headquarters for the television network was constructed across Riverside Drive next to the Walt Disney Feature Animation Building. The ABC building was designed by Aldo Rossi and is connected to the lot by a blue serpentine bridge that crosses over Riverside Drive. The ABC building also houses the offices of other subsidiaries such as [[ABC Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]].\n\n=== Digital Studio Center ===\nA two-story 17,000 square foot facility dedicated to post-production utilities and other, similar technical services. Opened in December 2012, the center is the home of Disney Digital Studio Services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tipton|first=Janelle|title=Digital Studio Center Debuts at The Walt Disney Studios|url=https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/blog/digital-studio-center-debuts-walt-disney-studios|work=The Walt Disney Company|publisher=The Disney Post|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Original Commissary===\nThis private cafeteria and grill opened in 1940 as Walt Disney's Studio Restaurant, and is now named the Buena Vista Caf\u00e9. Along with Stage 1, the Cutting Building, and the Main Theater, it is one of the few original buildings on the Burbank lot still serving its initial purpose. The commissary offers breakfast and lunch options for studio employees and guests, with indoor and outdoor seating. It once had an executive dining area called the Coral Room where Walt Disney occasionally lunched. The site was extensively remodeled in 2011, but Walt's favorite dish, [[chili con carne|chili]] served with [[Saltine cracker|crackers]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Korkis|title=Eating Like Walt Disney|website=Mouse Planet|date= August 31, 2011|access-date=August 21, 2016|url=https://www.mouseplanet.com/9723/Eating_Like_Walt_Disney}}</ref> remains on the menu. Buena Vista Caf\u00e9 is currently open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM. The grill shuts down at 2:30 PM; pre-packaged foods, snacks and beverages can be purchased until closing time.\n\nThere is a newer commissary at the ABC Studios Building, across from the main Disney lot on Riverside Drive in Burbank.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Los Angeles}}\n*''[[A Trip Through the Walt Disney Studios]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*[http://studioservices.go.com/disneystudios/index.html Walt Disney Studios website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20121130174512/http://cinchset.com/hickory.html ''A look at the history of Walt Disney studios Burbank back lot as used for Follow Me Boys! and other films.'']\n\n{{Disney}}\n{{Walt Disney Studios}}\n{{Burbank, California}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:American film studios]]\n[[Category:Backlot sets]]\n[[Category:Disney production studios]]\n[[Category:Media company headquarters in the United States]]\n[[Category:The Walt Disney Studios]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Burbank, California]]\n[[Category:Office buildings completed in 1940]]\n[[Category:1940 establishments in California]]\n", "name_user": "ILikeTau", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add a missing space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_(Burbank)"}

A more up to date alternative to classifying these languages on internal camparative grounds is to be found in the work of Johanson and his co-workers.</ref>\n\nGeographically and linguistically, the languages of the Northwestern and Southeastern subgroups belong to the central Turkic languages, while the Northeastern and Khalaj languages are the so-called peripheral languages.\n\nHruschka, et al.

Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\"/>\n\nSeveral presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: \"identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=65}}.</ref> In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kiruk with paragraph 13 noting that \"this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk\".<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=65\"/>\n\nAs primary victims of these Arabization policies, the Iraqi Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as \"Arabs\" in order to avoid discrimination.<ref name=\"International Crisis Group 2006 loc=5\">{{Harvnb|International Crisis Group|2006|loc=5}}.</ref> Thus, [[ethnic cleansing]] was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=66}}.</ref> Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies;<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/> Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=66\"/>\n\n== Extinct Turkic languages ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!width=30|Number\n!width=150|Name\n!width=150|Time of Extinct\n|-\n| align=center|-\n| [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto Turkic]] || align=center|Reconstructed language\n|-\n| align=center|1\n| [[Old Turkic language|Old Turkic]] || align=center|8th century\n|-\n| align=center|2\n| [[Old Anatolian Turkish]] || align=center|15th century\n|-\n| align=center|3\n| [[Pecheneg language|Pecheneg]] || align=center|12th century\n|-\n| align=center|4\n| [[Orkhon Turkic language|Orkhon Turkic]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|5\n| [[Khazar language|Khazar]] || align=center|13th century\n|-\n| align=center|6\n| [[Old Uyghur language|Old Uyghur]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|7\n| [[Khorezmian language (Turkic)|Khorezmian]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|8\n| [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] || align=center|14th century\n|-\n| align=center|9\n| [[Middle Turkic languages|Middle Turkic]] || align=center|15th century \n|-\n| align=center|10\n| [[Kipchak language|Kipchak]] || align=center|17th century\n|-\n| align=center|11\n| [[Cuman language|Cuman]] || align=center|1770\n|-\n| align=center|12\n| [[Old Tatar language|Old Tatar]] || align=center|19th century\n|-\n| align=center|13\n| [[Fergana Kipchak language|Fergana Kipchak]] || align=center|1920s\n|-\n| align=center|14\n| [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] || align=center|1921\n|-\n| align=center|15\n| [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] || align=center|1928\n|-\n| align=center|16\n| [[Fuyu Kyrgyz language|Fuyu Girgis]] || align=center|20th century\n|-\n| align=center|17\n| [[Dukhan language|Dukhan]] || align=center|21st century\n|-\n| align=center|18\n| [[Salchuq language|Salchuq]] || align=center|2013\n|}\n\n== Other possible relations ==\nThe Turkic language family is currently regarded as one of the world's primary [[Language family|language families]].<ref>George van DRIEM: Handbuch der Orientalistik.

In some cases the form given is found only in some dialects of the language, or a loanword is much more common (e.g. in Turkish, the preferred word for \"fire\" is the Persian-derived ''ate\u015f'', whereas the native ''od'' is dead).

Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to [[Arabization|Arabize]] the region.<ref name=\"Jenkins 2008 loc=15\">{{Harvnb|Jenkins|2008|loc=15}}.</ref> Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Iraq Region|Ba'th regime]] recognised that the city of [[Kirkuk]] was historically an Iraqi Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|Stansfield|2009|loc=64}}.</ref> Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk to work in the expanding oil industry. Although the Iraqi Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued.<ref name=\"Anderson & Stansfield 2009 loc=64\"/>\n\nSeveral presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime.
