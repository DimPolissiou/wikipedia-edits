And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983). His first big hit film was ''[[WarGames]]'', a summer hit in [[1983 in film|1983]],<ref name=tstbhl>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eeIhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JGMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6966%2C1801595|work=[[Pittsburgh Press]]|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title=Matthew Broderick toast of Broadway, Hollywood|date=July 19, 1983|page=A7}}</ref> in which he played the main role of David Lightman, a [[Seattle]] teen [[Hacker (term)|hacker]].

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane. The musical went on to win the most Tony Awards in history with 12 wins.<ref>https://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/facts/index.html</ref> Broderick and Lane reprised their roles in the 2005 film adaptation of [[The Producers (2005 film)|the same name]].\n\nBroderick was reunited with his co-star from ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', [[Nathan Lane]], in ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', which opened on Broadway in October 2005.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983).

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.

Pre-political institutions are the best place for securing our freedoms and so we should take encouragement that democratic governments cannot control them, and are sent packing when they attempt to do so.\"<ref name=\"theaustralian.com.au\">{{Cite news|last=Hastie|first=Andrew|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/opinion/political-class-ignored-the-people-and-paid-the-price/news-story/f1d35ad7c29f76daf08768182b316d55|title=Political class ignored the people and paid the price|date=November 23, 2016|work=The Australian|access-date=February 12, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== The power of community and PTSD ====\nHastie reflected on how his grandfather recovered from the trauma of [[World War II]] thanks, in part to the power of community, and laments that we may not have that power available to us now, \"Just thinking of my grandfather's own experience, he was shot up quite badly in the second world war where civil society was still very strong, community was still very strong, a lot of local clubs and organisations, I think he struggled with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] but I think his PTSD was mitigated by those little platoons that we talk about, he was very close to his comrades from the second war, and I'm just not sure if we have in today's society that same sort of cushioning and community support as we had 70 years ago.\"<ref name=\"Grattan\"/>\n\n==== Community and environment ====\nWhile environmental concern is often seen as a progressive cause, Hastie sets the environment between two concerns - that, as per the [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] contract - the good things inherited should be passed on to the next generation. And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

It runs 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) in a north-south direction. The southern trailhead is on Gadpouch Road in [[Cobalt, Connecticut|Cobalt, CT]] on the southern end of the [[Meshomasic State Forest]]. The northern trailhead is on Greaves Road past Bald Mountain and the [[Shenipsit State Forest]] in [[Stafford, Connecticut|Stafford, CT]]. The trail runs primarily through the [[Shenipsit State Forest|Shenipsit]] and [[Meshomasic State Forest|Meshomasic]] State Forests, and [[Case Mountain]], but also utilizes other public and private land holdings. The Native American name ''Shenipsit'' means ''at the great pool'',<ref>Connecticut Walk Book East, CFPA</ref>  referring to the Shenipsit Lake, which the trail passes by. The Shenipsit Trail is divided into three sections: South, Central, and North. The Shenipsit Trail is one of the blue-blazed hiking trails managed by the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]] (CFPA).<ref>Connecticut Walk Book East, CFPA</ref>\n\n==Trail Description==\nThe Shenipsit Trail covers 50 miles of rocky, hilly, forested terrain east of the Connecticut River. The trail is used for [[hiking]], running, and [[Mountain biking|mountain-biking]], and in the winter [[snowshoeing]], and [[cross-country skiing]]. Some sections are very rocky, steep, and technical, limiting use of those sections.\n\nThe Shenipsit Trail is marked by blue rectangular blazes. It is part of the [[Blue-Blazed Trails|blue-blazed trail system]] maintained by the CFPA. Founded in 1929, the CFPA has created and maintained 825 miles of blue-blazed trails in the state of Connecticut.<ref>http://www.ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails</ref>\n\n==Trail Route==\nThe Shenipsit Trail has three sections. The South section goes from Gadpouch Road in Cobalt to Route 2 in Glastonbury. The Central section goes from Route 2 to Risley Pond in Vernon. After a 4-mile gap between the Central and North sections, the North section goes from Grahaber Road in Tolland to Greaves Road in Stafford.\n\nThe Shenipsit Trail passes through the following Connecticut towns from south to north: East Hampton, Portland, Glastonbury, Manchester, Bolton, Vernon, Rockville, Tolland, Ellington, Stafford, and Somers.\n\n===South Section===\n[[File:CT River from Great Hill.JPG|thumb|right|Connecticut River as seen from Great Hill in the Meshomasic State Forest, just off the Shenipsit Trail]]\nThe South section of the Shenipsit trail runs from Gadpouch Road in Cobalt to Route 2 in Glastonbury.\nStarting on Gadpouch Road in Cobalt, CT next to the (former site of the) Meshomasic State Forest Ranger Headquarters, the trail climbs a very steep ridge to the top of Great Hill, a part of the Bald Hill Range. A spur trail takes hikers to a rocky vista with views of the Connecticut River, [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], and Great Hill Pond just below. The trail continues north along Great Hill Ridge, crossing Woodchoppers Rd, a dirt road in the state forest. Soon after, the trail crests over Bald Hill at 893 feet, the highest point on the Shenipsit Trail within the Meshomasic State Forest. The trail follows some unmaintained dirt roads and a few single-track trails until reaching [[Connecticut Route 2]] in [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]]. Hikers should take caution crossing the four-lane freeway and are recommended to take a connector trail to Dickinson Rd, then Mott Hill Rd, then Toll Gate Rd to go around Route 2.\n\n===Central Section===\n[[File:Lookout Mountain.JPG|thumb|left|View from Lookout Mountain, just off the Shenipsit Trail.]]\nThe Central Section goes from Route 2 in Glastonbury to Risley Pond in Vernon.\nThe Central Section of the trail starts just north of Route 2, and can be reached from Toll Gate Road in Glastonbury. The trail stretches about 4.9 miles from Route 2 to Hebron Avenue (Route 94) in Glastonbury. The trail crosses Hebron Ave at Birch Mountain Road.\n\nThe trail follows Birch Mountain Road for 0.3 mile before turning left into the woods and once again becomes a single track trail.  The trail crosses through many stone walls and enters the [[Case Mountain]] trail system. After crossing the power lines, the trail becomes very rocky and a section of it is referred to by mountain-bikers as \u201cSlick-Rock\u201d. Crossing Coop-Sawmill Road, a dirt road, the trail rolls up and down small steep hills until it reaches the top of Case Mountain in [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]]. Taking a left on the Lookout Mountain trail for 600 feet takes you to the top of Lookout Mountain where there are benches, information kiosks, and a vista with a view of Hartford and the Connecticut River Valley. The trail continues along a ridge past the intersection with the Lookout Mountain Trail, crosses Birch Mountain Rd in Manchester, then comes out on a residential street.\n[[File:Shenipsit Trail (2), December 2018.JPG|thumb|right|The trail along Shenipsit Lake in Rockville]]\nAfter following some trails, gas-line easements, and roads, the trail picks up again at an abandoned drive-in theater on US Route 6 near Bolton Notch State Park. The trail goes through Bolton Notch State Park for about a mile, then shares its pathway with the Hop River Bike Path for about two miles between Bolton Notch and Valley Falls Park. The trail crosses Bolton Road, and drops into the Belding Wildlife Management Area, crossing the Tankerhoosen River at the bottom of the mill pond. It then winds north between West Walker Reservoir and Highway 84, before ending at the public area on Reservoir Road at East Walker Reservoir, where there are picnic tables and fishing areas. From there, the trail follows roads for another four miles. Paved roads lead under the Route 31 underpass of Hwy 84 (exit 67) and down Route 30, then takes a turn through the Tolland County Agricultural Center, before making its way back to Route 30. The trail turns down Kingsbury Road and briefly down Route 74 before following a wooded trail (the former Stafford Springs Street Railway right-of-way) along Lake Shenipsit. At the northeast corner of the lake, the trail meets with Shenipsit Lake Road. The trail leaves public roads on Grahaber Rd in [[Tolland, Connecticut|Tolland]], a half mile west of the intersection of Shenipsit Lake Road and Grahaber Road/Browns Bridge Road, which is the southern end of the North section.\n\n===North Section===\nThe North Section of the Shenipsit trail starts at Grahaber Rd in Tolland. Continuing through the [[Shenipsit State Forest]], the trail climbs 1,075-foot Soapstone Mountain. On top of the mountain is a lookout tower that was built in the 1970s to replace a fire tower that had been built by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. The tower is just tall enough to see over the tree line, but from there one can see the Connecticut River Valley, [[Mount Greylock]] in the [[The Berkshires|Berkshires]] of [[Massachusetts]], and [[Mount Monadnock]] in [[New Hampshire]].

It runs 50 miles (80&nbsp;km) in a north-south direction. The southern trailhead is on Gadpouch Road in [[Cobalt, Connecticut|Cobalt, CT]] on the southern end of the [[Meshomasic State Forest]]. The northern trailhead is on Greaves Road past Bald Mountain and the [[Shenipsit State Forest]] in [[Stafford, Connecticut|Stafford, CT]]. The trail runs primarily through the [[Shenipsit State Forest|Shenipsit]] and [[Meshomasic State Forest|Meshomasic]] State Forests, and [[Case Mountain]], but also utilizes other public and private land holdings. The Native American name \u201cShenipsit\u201d means \u201cat the great  pool,\u201d<ref>Connecticut Walk Book East, CFPA</ref>  referring to the Shenipsit Lake, which the trail passes by. The Shenipsit Trail is divided into three sections: South, Central, and North. The Shenipsit Trail is one of the blue-blazed hiking trails managed by the [[Connecticut Forest and Park Association]] (CFPA).<ref>Connecticut Walk Book East, CFPA</ref>\n\n==Trail Description==\nThe Shenipsit Trail covers 50 miles of rocky, hilly, forested terrain east of the Connecticut River. The trail is used for [[hiking]], running, and [[Mountain biking|mountain-biking]], and in the winter [[snowshoeing]], and [[cross-country skiing]]. Some sections are very rocky, steep, and technical, limiting use of those sections.\n\nThe Shenipsit Trail is marked by blue rectangular blazes. It is part of the [[Blue-Blazed Trails|blue-blazed trail system]] maintained by the CFPA. Founded in 1929, the CFPA has created and maintained 825 miles of blue-blazed trails in the state of Connecticut.<ref>http://www.ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails</ref>\n\n==Trail Route==\nThe Shenipsit Trail has three sections. The South section goes from Gadpouch Road in Cobalt to Route 2 in Glastonbury. The Central section goes from Route 2 to Risley Pond in Vernon. After a 4-mile gap between the Central and North sections, the North section goes from Grahaber Road in Tolland to Greaves Road in Stafford.\n\nThe Shenipsit Trail passes through the following Connecticut towns from south to north: East Hampton, Portland, Glastonbury, Manchester, Bolton, Vernon, Rockville, Tolland, Ellington, Stafford, and Somers.\n\n===South Section===\n[[File:CT River from Great Hill.JPG|thumb|right|Connecticut River as seen from Great Hill in the Meshomasic State Forest, just off the Shenipsit Trail]]\nThe South section of the Shenipsit trail runs from Gadpouch Road in Cobalt to Route 2 in Glastonbury.\nStarting on Gadpouch Road in Cobalt, CT next to the (former site of the) Meshomasic State Forest Ranger Headquarters, the trail climbs a very steep ridge to the top of Great Hill, a part of the Bald Hill Range. A spur trail takes hikers to a rocky vista with views of the Connecticut River, [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], and Great Hill Pond just below. The trail continues north along Great Hill Ridge, crossing Woodchoppers Rd, a dirt road in the state forest. Soon after, the trail crests over Bald Hill at 893 feet, the highest point on the Shenipsit Trail within the Meshomasic State Forest. The trail follows some unmaintained dirt roads and a few single-track trails until reaching [[Connecticut Route 2]] in [[Glastonbury, Connecticut|Glastonbury]]. Hikers should take caution crossing the four-lane freeway and are recommended to take a connector trail to Dickinson Rd, then Mott Hill Rd, then Toll Gate Rd to go around Route 2.\n\n===Central Section===\n[[File:Lookout Mountain.JPG|thumb|left|View from Lookout Mountain, just off the Shenipsit Trail.]]\nThe Central Section goes from Route 2 in Glastonbury to Risley Pond in Vernon.\nThe Central Section of the trail starts just north of Route 2, and can be reached from Toll Gate Road in Glastonbury. The trail stretches about 4.9 miles from Route 2 to Hebron Avenue (Route 94) in Glastonbury. The trail crosses Hebron Ave at Birch Mountain Road.\n\nThe trail follows Birch Mountain Road for 0.3 mile before turning left into the woods and once again becomes a single track trail.  The trail crosses through many stone walls and enters the [[Case Mountain]] trail system. After crossing the power lines, the trail becomes very rocky and a section of it is referred to by mountain-bikers as \u201cSlick-Rock\u201d. Crossing Coop-Sawmill Road, a dirt road, the trail rolls up and down small steep hills until it reaches the top of Case Mountain in [[Manchester, Connecticut|Manchester]]. Taking a left on the Lookout Mountain trail for 600 feet takes you to the top of Lookout Mountain where there are benches, information kiosks, and a vista with a view of Hartford and the Connecticut River Valley. The trail continues along a ridge past the intersection with the Lookout Mountain Trail, crosses Birch Mountain Rd in Manchester, then comes out on a residential street.\n[[File:Shenipsit Trail (2), December 2018.JPG|thumb|right|The trail along Shenipsit Lake in Rockville]]\nAfter following some trails, gas-line easements, and roads, the trail picks up again at an abandoned drive-in theater on US Route 6 near Bolton Notch State Park. The trail goes though Bolton Notch State Park for about a mile, then shares its pathway with the Hop River Bike Path for about two miles between Bolton Notch and Valley Falls Park. The trail crosses Bolton Road, and drops into the Belding Wildlife Management Area, crossing the Tankerhoosen River at the bottom of the mill pond. It then winds north between West Walker Reservoir and Highway 84, before ending at the public area on Reservoir Road at East Walker Reservoir, where there are picnic tables and fishing areas. From there, the trail follows roads for another four miles. Paved roads lead under the Route 31 underpass of Hwy 84 (exit 67) and down Route 30, then takes a turn through the Tolland County Agricultural Center, before making its way back to Route 30. The trail turns down Kingsbury Road and briefly down Route 74 before following a wooded trail (the former Stafford Springs Street Railway right-of-way) along Lake Shenipsit. At the northeast corner of the lake, the trail meets with Shenipsit Lake Road. The trail leaves public roads on Grahaber Rd in [[Tolland, Connecticut|Tolland]], a half mile west of the intersection of Shenipsit Lake Road and Grahaber Road/Browns Bridge Road, which is the southern end of the North section.\n\n===North Section===\nThe North Section of the Shenipsit trail starts at Grahaber Rd in Tolland. Continuing through the [[Shenipsit State Forest]], the trail climbs 1,075 foot Soapstone Mountain. On top of the mountain is a lookout tower which was built in the 1970s to replace a fire tower that had been built by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. The tower is just tall enough to see over the tree line, but from there one can see the Connecticut River Valley, [[Mount Greylock]] in the [[The Berkshires|Berkshires]] of [[Massachusetts]], and [[Mount Monadnock]] in [[New Hampshire]]. Continuing down the mountain, the trail comes to an end on Greaves Road in Stafford.<ref>http://www.ctwoodlands.org/blue-blazed-hiking-trails/shenipsit-trail</ref>\n\nHistorically, this trail continued north beyond Bald Mountain, Perkins Mountain, and Rattlesnake Mountain in Somers and ended in the town of [[Hampden, Massachusetts]].

These rifles are often equipped with red dot sights, weapon mounted lights, 30 round magazines, and slings. The department issued sidearm is a [[Glock]]22 or the smaller Glock 23 depending on the hand size and personal preference of the officer. These guns are loaded with [[.40 S&W]] [[Hollow-point bullet]]. However, as the FBI switches to the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]], ACPD is planning to do the same and may soon begin equipping its officers with the Glock 17 or Glock 19, both chambered in 9mm. Previously, officers had the option of carrying 12 gauge [[Remington Model 870]] shotguns, but these are being phased out by the AR-15 rifles. Officers can also carry backup weapons in addition to their issued sidearm, provided that their backup weapon is chambered for [[.380 ACP]] or greater. For less than lethal options, officers are equipped with [[Baton (law enforcement)]] and [[TASER X2 Defender]] tasers.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Virginia}}\n* [[List of law enforcement agencies in Virginia]]\n* [[Arlington County Sheriff's Office (Virginia)|Arlington County Sheriff's Office]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Arlington County Police Department}}\n*[http://police.arlingtonva.us/ Arlington County Police Department official weblink]\n*[http://sheriff.arlingtonva.us/ Arlington County Sheriff's Office official weblink]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/19961018074749/http://www.co.arlington.va.us/ Arlington County government official website]\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/Police/PoliceMain.aspx |title=Arlington County Police Department |access-date=August 13, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710123518/http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/Police/PoliceMain.aspx |archive-date=July 10, 2005 |url-status=bot: unknown }}\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.co.arlington.va.us/police/ |title=Arlington County Police Department |access-date=May 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010124054400/http://www.co.arlington.va.us/police/ |archive-date=January 24, 2001 |url-status=bot: unknown }}\n*{{Cite web |url=http://www.co.arlington.va.us/pol/index.htm |title=Arlington County Police Department |access-date=May 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970626141459/http://www.co.arlington.va.us/pol/index.htm |archive-date=June 26, 1997 |url-status=bot: unknown }}\n\n[[Category:County law enforcement agencies of Virginia]]\n[[Category:Arlington County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:County police departments of Virginia]]\n[[Category:1940 establishments in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Government agencies established in 1940]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Law enforcement agency\n| agencyname      = Arlington County Police Department\n| nativename      =\n| nativenamea     =\n| nativenamer     =\n| commonname      = Arlington County P.D.\n| abbreviation    = ACPD\n| fictional       =\n| patch           = Patch of the Arlington County Police Department.png\n| patchcaption    =\n| logo            = Badge of the Arlington County Police Department.png\n| logocaption     = Badge of an Arlington County Police Department officer \n| badge           = Arlington Police medallion (7983206713).jpg \n| badgecaption    = Seal of the Arlington County Police Department\n| flag            = Flag of Arlington County, Virginia.svg\n| flagcaption     = Flag of Arlington County, Virginia\n| imagesize       =\n| motto           =\n| mottotranslated =\n| mission         =\n| formedyear      = 1963<ref name=history>{{Cite web|url=http://www.co.arlington.va.us:80/pol/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001209204400/http://www.co.arlington.va.us/pol/history.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 9, 2000|title=Arlington's Police Department: The History|date=1998|work=Arlington County Police Department|author=Arlington County Police Department|location=Virginia|publisher=Arlington County|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}</ref>\n| formedmonthday  = October 1\n| preceding1      = Arlington County Division of Police (February 1940 \u2013 October 1963)<ref name=history/>\n| dissolved       = \n| superseding     =\n| employees       = 465\n| volunteers      =\n| budget          = $58 million\n| nongovernment   =\n| country         = United States\n| countryabbr     = USA\n| national        =\n| federal         =\n| international   =\n| divtype         = Commonwealth (U.S. state){{!}}Commonwealth\n| divname         = Virginia\n| divdab          =\n| subdivtype      = County (United States){{!}}County\n| subdivname      = Arlington\n| subdivdab       =\n| map             = Map_of_Virginia_highlighting_Arlington_County.svg\n| mapcaption      =\n| sizearea        = {{convert|26|sqmi|km2}}\n| sizepopulation  = 207,627\n| legaljuris      = [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]]\n| governingbody   = Arlington County, Virginia{{!}}County of Arlington\n| governingbodyscnd =\n| constitution1   = Yes\n| police          = Yes\n| local           = Yes\n| military        =\n| provost         =\n| gendarmerie     =\n| religious       =\n| speciality      =\n| secret          =\n| overviewtype    =\n| overviewbody    =\n| headquarters    = [[Arlington County, Virginia]]\n| hqlocmap        =\n| hqlocleft       =\n| hqloctop        =\n| hqlocmappoptitle =\n| sworntype       = Police officer\n| sworn           = 361\n| unsworntype     = Civilian\n| unsworn         = 104\n| multinational   =\n| electeetype     =\n| minister1name   =\n| minister1pfo    =\n| chief1name      = M.

These rifles are often equipped with red dot sights, weapon mounted lights, 30 round magazines, and slings. The department issued sidearm is a [[Glock]]22 or the smaller Glock 23 depending on the hand size and personal preference of the officer. These guns are loaded with [[.40 S&W]] [[Hollow-point bullet]]. However, as the FBI switches to the [[9\u00d719mm Parabellum]], ACPD is planning to do the same and may soon begin equipping its officers with the Glock 17 or Glock 19, both chambered in 9mm. Previously, officers had the option of carrying 12 gauge [[Remington Model 870]] shotguns, but these are being phased out by the AR-15 rifles. Officers can also carry backup weapons in addition to their issued sidearm, provided that their backup weapon is chambered for [[.380 ACP]] or greater.

Many MNLA fighters were previously members of the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), another guerrilla force which the British had secretly trained and armed during [[World War II]] to fight against the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese Occupation]]. The Communist Party, which had been banned in the pre-war years, was thereafter granted legal recognition by the British after the war as a reward for its wartime effort, but had secretly kept some of the MPAJA's weapons for future use. The MCP used violence to support its union organisation, and the British used restrictions, including banishing key communist leaders not born locally, in an attempt to restrict trade union activity. This mutual antagonism climaxed with an armed revolt in 1948, which resulted in the declaration of a [[Malayan Emergency|state of emergency]] in June 1948.\n\n=== The Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) ===\nOn the 16th June 1948, three British plantation managers were assassinated in [[Perak]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History|last=Peng|first=Chin|last2=Ward|first2=Ian|last3=Miraflor|first3=Norma|publisher=Media Masters|year=2003|isbn=981-04-8693-6|location=Singapore|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref> In response to these murders the British colonial authorities enacted emergency measures which included outlawing leftist parties and conducting mass arrests of trade union activists and communists. Fleeing the cities, Malayan Communist Party activists and their supporters (including Chin Peng) regrouped deep in the Malayan jungles and founded the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), a guerrilla army to wage armed resistance against British. In an attempt to force the British to leave Malaya, the MNLA conducted attacks against soldiers, police, colonial collaborators, and conducted industrial sabotage. During the early years of the Emergency, the MNLA guerrillas would destroy rubber plantations in an attempt to harm the British economy whose war-time debt to the Americans and post-war social programs partially relied on the profits of the Malayan rubber trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Counterinsurgency|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-230-29824-8|location=Basingstoke|pages=42\u201343}}</ref> These guerrillas were supported by a network of civilian supporters called the Min Yuen, whose members would live a normal life in towns while gathering intelligence, recruiting new members, spreading propaganda and collecting supplies for the MNLA.\n\nThe MNLA allowed people of any race as well as women to join the guerrilla army as any prejudice between race and sex was believed by the MNLA and MCP to be a tool of capitalism to divide the working class. Due to their location deep within Malaya's jungles, the MNLA often came into contact with the aboriginal [[Orang Asli]], recruiting them as trackers and using their villages as a food source.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Violence & The Dream People: The Orang Asli in the Malayan Emergency 1948-1960|last=D. Leary|first=John|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|year=1995|isbn=978-0896801868|location=Athens|pages=72}}</ref> However, despite their attempts to recruit from all ethnic backgrounds, the MNLA membership was still overwhelmingly made up of ethnic Chinese.\n\nLess than a month into the Emergency, Britain's High Commissioner in Malaya [[Edward Gent]] died in an airplane collision.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1951 his replacement, [[Henry Gurney]] was killed by MNLA guerrillas in an ambush against his convoy near [[Fraser's Hill]] resort. The next High Commissioner was [[Gerald Templer]] who is credited by many historians as being the most effective in defeating the MNLA guerrillas. Templer oversaw the finalising of the [[Briggs' Plan]], the British military strategy to defeat Malayan communism by destroying rural villages and imprisoning thousands of ethnic Chinese-Malayans in a system of internment camps called [[New village|\"new villages\"]]<nowiki/>s. By early 1952 over 400,000 people (mostly ethnic Chinese) had been imprisoned in New Village internment camps and deprived of all civil rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Bookmarks Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-1-909026-29-2|location=London|pages=219}}</ref> Templer then attempted to starve the MNLA out of the jungles by destroying farmland, spraying chemical herbacides from airplanes to destroy crops, and enforcing a food rationing system for Malayan villagers so that they could not share food with MNLA members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Booksmarks Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-1-909026-29-2|location=London|pages=220}}</ref> In [[Tanjung Malim]], the British halved food rations on the town after the population refused to give them information on communist activities. The British resorted to collective punishment and enacted a 22 hour curfew on all civilians, then surrounded the town in barbed wire and sentry towers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref>\n\nThe Briggs Plan and the New Village internment camps had succeeded in segregating the civilian population from the MNLA guerrillas in the jungles and severely damaged their ability to continue fighting. The food denial campaign also put great pressure on the MNLA and damaged their ability to conduct assaults against British positions.\n\nThe Emergency officially came to an end in 1960, although the MNLA had already been defeated as an effective fighting force for years. \n\n===Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968-1989)===\nDefeated in the first Malayan emergency and outwitted in Singapore politics by nationalist politician [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the MCP by the mid-1960s was fragmented.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} However, in 1968 the MNLA reappeared and operated from across the Thai border and carried out ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, as well as laid traps for Malaysian military. The MNLA fought in the highly forested area near the Thai border in the north of the [[Malay peninsula]]. The MNLA was not able to reform to its' former size and the MCP began recruitment of Thai Malays as well as distributing pamphlets preaching the compatibility between Islam and Communism. The MNLA had some success early on in the insurgency, at one point killing 17 members of the security forces in a single attack.

Many MNLA fighters were previously members of the [[Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army]] (MPAJA), another guerrilla force which the British had secretly trained and armed during [[World War II]] to fight against the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese Occupation]]. The Communist Party, which had been banned in the pre-war years, was thereafter granted legal recognition by the British after the war as a reward for its wartime effort, but had secretly kept some of the MPAJA's weapons for future use. The MCP used violence to support its union organisation, and the British used restrictions, including banishing key communist leaders not born locally, in an attempt to restrict trade union activity. This mutual antagonism climaxed with an armed revolt in 1948, which resulted in the declaration of a [[Malayan Emergency|state of emergency]] in June 1948.\n\n=== The Malayan Emergency (1948-1960) ===\nOn the 16th June 1948, three British plantation managers were assassinated in [[Perak]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alias Chin Peng: My Side of History|last=Peng|first=Chin|last2=Ward|first2=Ian|last3=Miraflor|first3=Norma|publisher=Media Masters|year=2003|isbn=981-04-8693-6|location=Singapore|pages=214\u2013215}}</ref> In response to these murders the British colonial authorities enacted emergency measures which included outlawing leftist parties and conducting mass arrests of trade union activists and communists. Fleeing the cities, Malayan Communist Party activists and their supporters (including Chin Peng) regrouped deep in the Malayan jungles and founded the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), a guerrilla army to wage armed resistance against British. In an attempt to force the British to leave Malaya, the MNLA conducted attacks against soldiers, police, colonial collaborators, and conducted industrial sabotage. During the early years of the Emergency, the MNLA guerrillas would destroy rubber plantations in an attempt to harm the British economy whose war-time debt to the Americans and post-war social programs partially relied on the profits of the Malayan rubber trade.<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Counterinsurgency|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-0-230-29824-8|location=Basingstoke|pages=42\u201343}}</ref> These guerrillas were supported by a network of civilian supporters called the Min Yuen, whose members would live a normal life in towns while gathering inteligence, recruiting new members, spreading propaganda and collecting supplies for the MNLA.\n\nThe MNLA allowed people of any race as well as women to join the guerrilla army as any prejudice between race and sex was believed by the MNLA and MCP to be a tool of capitalism to divide the working class. Due to their location deep within Malaya's jungles, the MNLA often came into contact with the aboriginal [[Orang Asli]], recruiting them as trackers and using their villages as a food source.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Violence & The Dream People: The Orang Asli in the Malayan Emergency 1948-1960|last=D. Leary|first=John|publisher=Ohio University Center for International Studies|year=1995|isbn=978-0896801868|location=Athens|pages=72}}</ref> However, despite their attempts to recruit from all ethnic backgrounds, the MNLA membership was still overwhelmingly made up of ethnic Chinese.\n\nLess than a month into the Emergency, Britain's High Commissioner in Malaya [[Edward Gent]] died in an airplane collision.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1951 his replacement, [[Henry Gurney]] was killed by MNLA guerrillas in an ambush against his convoy near [[Fraser's Hill]] resort. The next High Commissioner was [[Gerald Templer]] who is credited by many historians as being the most effective in defeating the MNLA guerrillas. Templer oversaw the finalising of the [[Briggs' Plan]], the British military strategy to defeat Malayan communism by destroying rural villages and imprisoning thousands of ethnic Chinese-Malayans in a system of internment camps called [[New village|\"new villages\"]]<nowiki/>s. By early 1952 over 400,000 people (mostly ethnic Chinese) had been imprisoned in New Village internment camps and deprived of all civil rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Bookmarks Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-1-909026-29-2|location=London|pages=219}}</ref> Templer then attempted to starve the MNLA out of the jungles by destroying farmland, spraying chemical herbacides from airplanes to destroy crops, and enforcing a food rationing system for Malayan villagers so that they could not share food with MNLA members.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|last=Newsinger|first=John|publisher=Booksmarks Publications|year=2013|isbn=978-1-909026-29-2|location=London|pages=220}}</ref> In [[Tanjung Malim]], the British halved food rations on the town after the population refused to give them information on communist activities. The British resorted to collective punishment and enacted a 22 hour curfew on all civilians, then surrounded the town in barbed wire and sentry towers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small Wars Faraway Places: Global Insurrection and the Making of the Modern World 1945-1965|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|publisher=Viking - Penguin Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-670-02545-9|location=New York|pages=178}}</ref>\n\nThe Briggs Plan and the New Village internment camps had succeeded in segregating the civilian population from the MNLA guerrillas in the jungles and severely damaged their ability to continue fighting. The food denial campaign also put great pressure on the MNLA and damaged their ability to conduct assaults against British positions.\n\nThe Emergency officially came to an end in 1960, although the MNLA had already been defeated as an effective fighting force for years. \n\n===Communist insurgency in Malaysia (1968-1989)===\nDefeated in the first Malayan emergency and outwitted in Singapore politics by nationalist politician [[Lee Kuan Yew]], the MCP by the mid-1960s was fragmented.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} However, in 1968 the MNLA reappeared and operated from across the Thai border and carried out ambushes, hit-and-run attacks, as well as laid traps for Malaysian military. The MNLA fought in the highly forested area near the Thai border in the north of the [[Malay peninsula]]. The MNLA was not able to reform to its' former size and the MCP began recruitment of Thai Malays as well as distributing pamphlets preaching the compatibility between Islam and Communism. The MNLA had some success early on in the insurgency, at one point killing 17 members of the security forces in a single attack. In 1989, the MCP came to the negotiating table and reached an agreement with the Malaysian government which would allow MCP/MNLA members to return to Malaysia if they laid down their arms. Some MCP/MNLA members settled in \"peace villages\" in Southern Thailand, while others returned to Malaysia. However, Secretary-General of the MCP Chin Peng was subsequently denied the right to return to Malaysia in spite of the agreement between the MCP and the government.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n{{Communism in Malaysia}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Communism in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Defunct communist militant groups]]\n[[Category:Military history of Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Paramilitary organisations based in Malaysia]]\n[[Category:Malayan Emergency]]\n[[Category:Military wings of political parties]]\n[[Category:1948 establishments in Malaya]]\n[[Category:1989 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1948]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1989]]\n", "name_user": "Toweli", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Races_Liberation_Army"}
