His father, Cassius was a lawyer by training who founded a publishing business in the late 1890s. Louis had one younger brother [[Frederick Upton]], and three younger sisters, Katherine, Louise and Marjorie Upton.<ref>Find A Grave,[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/95349276/louis-cassius-upton], ''Find A Grave''</ref> He is the descendant of Civil War General [[Emory Upton]], and [[Francis Robbins Upton]], a physicist and assistant to [[Thomas Edison]].\n\nIn 1903, when Louis was 17 and a junior in high school, his father was killed in a streetcar accident in Chicago.<ref>Find A Grave,[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/15331337/cassius-marcellus-upton \"Cassius was killed in a streetcar accident in LaGrange, IL while their children were still young.\"], ''Find A Grave - Cassius Upton''</ref> Louis got a job selling insurance to help support the family at the same time that he was completing high school.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n==Business career==\nLouis Upton graduated in 1908 from [[Lake Forest Academy]] in [[Lake Forest, Illinois]].<ref>Lake Forest Academy and Ferry Hall Archives,[http://www.idaillinois.org/digital/collection/nlfacadem01/id/447], ''Louis Cassius Upton Senior Yearbook Portrait, 1908''</ref>\n\n===Early career===\nUpon graduation Upton attempted to sell insurance to W.S. Klein, the secretary-treasurer of the [[Commonwealth Edison]] company. Although Klein did not buy insurance, he was impressed by Upton and offered him a job, which Upton accepted. At Edison, Upton was introduced to the fast-developing field of electricity, and he became obsessed with the idea of making an electric washing machine. In 1908, Upton was approached by E.C. Williams, a hardware merchant in [[South Bend, Indiana]], who wanted to organize a company to manufacture home washers. Williams planned to open a factory in South Bend, and asked Upton to handle the sales department. Williams needed capital, and Upton offered the $500 he had saved. When the firm almost immediately went bankrupt. The owner, E.C. Williams, felt responsible for Louis' loss and told him he could take a patent of his choosing as compensation for his loss. Upton chose a patent on a hand-powered washing machine. Being a highly imaginative person, he thought the washer could someday have an electric motor attached to it.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n===Fabrication of the electric washer===\n[[File:Upton Electric by Upton Machine Company, 1912.png|thumb|Upton Electric by Upton Machine Co., 1912]]\nUpton was not deterred by the E.C. Williams Manufacturing Co. failure. He took the hand washer patent to his uncle, Emory Upton, a mechanic in [[Benton Harbor, Michigan]], and asked him to motorize it to be powered by electricity.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref> He also returned to his job at [[Commonwealth Edison]]. This was not to be the first electric washing machine. Although the first electric washing machine is credited to A.J. Fisher in 1907, there were patents filed for such machines before Fisher's application.<ref>Lee Maxwell,[http://www.oldewash.com/articles/Electric_Washer.pdf \"Who Invented the Electric Washing Machine? An Example of how Patents are Misused by Historians\"], ''Lee Maxwell, Feb 19, 2009''</ref>\n\nEventually, Emory Upton built a transmission that worked. Louis Upton took the electric washer to [[Federal Electric Company]], a company affiliated with Commonwealth Edison, and talked them into ordering 100 washers to be sold on the retail market for $85 each. He set up a shop in Benton Harbor where, with the help of his brother [[Frederick Upton|Frederick]], he built the electric washers while commuting to his job at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago, approximately 100 miles away. It was said that Louis painted the washers by hand, and Frederick crated them and took them by horse-drawn cart to the shipping point.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C. Upton's Determination And Vision Overcame All Obstacles\"], ''Herald Palladium, Oct 10, 1952''</ref>\n\nLouis and Frederick Upton delivered the 100 washing machines. However, a major problem arose: with daily use, the gears of every washer broke down. Federal Electric's president, John F. Gilchrist, summoned the 25-year-old Upton to his office and demanded the money back saying, \u201cYour product is a failure and money must be refunded to purchasers\u201d. Upton, ever confident and the salesman, replied that he would be happy to refund the money but he didn't then have any. He went on to explain that he had already spoken to Federal's master mechanic about a fix, and, with some time, could solve the problem. Federal agreed, and the master mechanic, Gustav B. Keil, who later came to work for Upton, solved the problem by using steel rather than cast iron in the gears. Describing the new gears, he told Upton, \"''They're O.K. I've used everything on them but an axe''\u201d. In the end, Federal Electric agreed with Keil and Upton emerged from disgrace with an order of 200 washers - but with new gears.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C. Upton's Determination And Vision Overcame All Obstacles\"], ''Herald Palladium, Oct 10, 1952''</ref>\n\n===Upton Machine Company===\nLouis Upton got the 200 washers turned out as he promised, but the costs proved to be excessive. This time he was really broke, but production was on the way up - producing 10 machines a day. He looked around for a financial backer, and he found one in a LaGrange friend and banker, Lowell C. Bassford. Bassford agreed to supply $5000 on the condition that Louis work for the company full-time, quitting his job at Commonwealth Edison. Thus was formed the Upton Machine Company on November 11, 1911 by Louis Upton, his uncle Emory Upton and Lowell Bassford. Louis took on the role as President, while Emory was Secretary and Treasurer. Louis\u2019 brother [[Frederick Upton|Frederick]] joined the company a few months later in 1912 as office manager. The company soon moved to a small building in the Edgewater area of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]]. In the beginning, Louis paid himself a salary of $10 a week while Fred received $8. Emory Upton was the high salaried man at $30 a week. Bassford had received 500 shares of stock in return for his capital, while Emory received 1,265 shares and Louis 1,000 shares in the new company.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C.

One reason may have been the experience involved in using the machine, which a newspaper described this way; \u201c''The hand washers of those days enabled a woman to rock back and forth in a chair as she pulled the handle which operated the rocking action of the washer. The electrified version of this washer was a fearful and wonderful object. It was a hand washer with a motor added, and power transmitted to the washing mechanism by means of a belt drive and cast iron gears. All the mechanism was exposed; all of it could get wet, and often did. The possibility of electrocution went practically hand-in-hand with the down payment. But it was electric. And it did work.''\u201d Weak initial demand for the electric washer may also have been due to a simple reluctance to change. The local newspaper summarized: \u201c''The company did not flourish as well as was expected, for there was but a meager demand for those hazardous contraptions, electric washing machines, and many women of the era felt that if wash tubs were good enough for grandma, they were good enough for them.''\u201d<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C. Upton's Determination And Vision Overcame All Obstacles\"], ''Herald Palladium, Oct 10, 1952''</ref>\n\nOn Oct 1, 1912, in order to run the company leaner, the board decided to lower executive pays. Emory Upton's pay was lowered to $0.50/hour for all time put into the business. Louis were to receive salary not to exceed $15 per week as President. None of the workers pay were affected.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/363187414/ \"Whirlpool Corporation\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 30, 1957''</ref>\n\nAnother blow struck in early 1913 when the [[Federal Electric Company]], foreseeing wider acceptance for electric washers, decided to begin manufacturing the machines itself. The Upton Machine Company had lost its best customer at the exact moment when its washer production was beginning to increase.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n====Boy scout kits and air rifles====\nFacing the problem of insufficient demand, Louis Upton improvised. The American Tool Works, located across the street from the Upton Machine Company, had run into financial difficulties after a fire destroyed their factory on October 29, 1909.<ref>St. Joseph Saturday Herald,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Joseph_Saturday_Herald_Sat_Oct_30_1909.jpg \"Toolworks Burns\"], ''St. Joseph Saturday Herald, Oct 30, 1909''</ref> In 1914, Upton Machine Co. took over the plant, which made the Sterling air rifle, camp kits and lithograph toys. A deal was made with owner Frank Graves for Upton Machine Co. to take over the $25,000 mortgage and paid out another $25,000 in Upton Machine Co. stock. The deal came with fresh capital from [[Lowell C. Bassford]] who put in another $2,500 and another LaGrange man, [[Chas. F. Braffett]] who invested $10,000. The board of directors grew to five men; Braffett's investment made him President of the company. Louis Upton was Vice President and General Manager, [[E.A. Blakeslee]] who was the President of the St. Joseph's chamber of commerce became treasurer, Emory Upton was secretary and Louis's brother [[Frederick Upton]] joined the board and was given the title of Assistant Manager, he was also awarded 235 stock shares in lieu of back salary due him and services rendered.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/363187414/ \"Whirlpool Corporation\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 30, 1957''</ref> After restructuring, the company was employing about 40 mechanics and combining the two industries under one mutual sales team.<ref>St. Joseph Saturday Herald,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:St_Joseph_Saturday_Herald_Sat_Nov_7_1914.jpg \"Upton Machine Company and American Tool Works Combine\"], ''St. Joseph Saturday Herald, Nov 7, 1914''</ref><ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n[[File:Kamp-Kook-Kit by Upton Machine Company Illustration.png|thumb|The Kamp-Kook-Kit, A portable Camp Kit that fits in your pocket.]]\n\nDuring 1914 the Upton Machine Co. worked to improve the air rifle and since the Sterling name had a poor reputation, renamed the product The Upton. Temporarily, washers became a sidelight while air rifles kept the company afloat. In 1915 washing machine sales were only $18,000, while the rifle business totalled $62,000 in sales.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\nThings finally turned around for the washing machine business when in April 1916, Louis got a meeting at the [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]], which at that point had sold only hand washers, mistrusting the electric contrivances. But at his first sales meeting with Sears, armed with an electric washer, Louis Upton came away with an order for 25 machines monthly, but sales were by catalog only. The business relationship with [[Sears]] planted a seed for its growth to the top of laundry manufacturers in the United States.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\nOn Oct 19, 1917 [[Chas. F. Braffett]], then President of Upton Machine Co. killed himself despondent of ill health. The body of the manufacturer was found on the kitchen floor by one of the members of the family and the open gas jet gave the conclusive evidence as to the cause of his death. He left no word of explanation, but it was known he had worried considerably over his ill health.<ref>Herald Press,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Herald_Press_Sat_Oct_20_1917.jpg \"C.F Braffett Takes Life\"], ''Herald Press - Front Page, Oct 20, 1917''</ref>\n\nAt the following shareholder meeting, the company announced the new corporate structure. [[Lowell C. Bassford]] was to take over as President. Louis stayed on as Vice President and General Manager, his new brother-in-law [[H.T. Campbell]] became Secretary, and [[Frederick Upton]] as Superintendent.<ref>Herald Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/362340922/ \"A Look Back - Items of Interest Taken from the Daily Press' Files 20 or 10 Years Ago\"], ''Herald Press - Jan 12, 1929''</ref>\n\nIn February 1918 the Upton Machine Co. paid the [[Stopple Kook Kit Company]] $5,000 for the patents, tools and manufacturing rights to make a pocket camping kit called the \"Kamp-Kook-Kit\" that eventually became the official Boy Scout mess kit.<ref>Boys' Life,[https://books.google.com/books?id=D7DKXacj7loC&lpg=PA54&ots=IHZ75zE1kS&dq=official%20boy%20scout%20handbook%201st%20edition%20upton&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Boys' Life\"], ''Boys' Life - The Magazine for all Boys. Published by the Boy Scouts of America, June 1925''</ref>\n\n====Sears, Roebuck and Company====\nIn June 1920 Sears ordered 15,000 washers that were to be built as soon as possible. The Upton Machine Co. building was too small to produce the order, so in 1921 Sears loaned the Upton Machine Co. $87,500 to add a building next to the original washer plant, extending in an \"L\" shape toward the west. But before any machines were built, the economy slumped and Sears canceled its order. The Upton Machine Co. now owed Sears $87,500 and had no way to repay it. Sears agreed to cancel the loan in exchange for shares of stock in the Upton Machine Co., a transaction that built a strong tie between the two companies. The washer plant addition was completed in 1924 and was equipped to make 100 washers a day, including at least 50 a day exclusively for Sears.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the economy had recovered and Sears agreed that the Upton Machine Co. would be its sole provider of washing machines. Upton had an idea; up to that point, Sears sold its products through its catalogue. Upton believed that major purchases such as washing machines needed expert face to face sales involvement and he sold the idea to former Brigader general [[Robert E. Wood]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]\u2019s president. Upton Machine Company began selling washers and ironers in Sears\u2019 80 retail locations. Upton Machine Company salesmen organized sales, set up displays, and trained Sears sales personnel. It was another turning point in the history of the Upton company\u2014in three years, the Sears sales of home laundry appliances jumped from 25,000 to 1,250,000 yearly.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n====Largest toy manufacturer in the Mid-West====\nOn February 20, 1928, the Upton Machine Co. announced a large contract to start mass production of light metal toys for the F.W. Woolworth and S. S. Kresge companies and several other large syndicate stores throughout the United States. To make room for the expansion in the toy manufacturing industry it sold its air rifle business to the [[All Metal Products Company]] of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The same day Upton announced that the company planned to add from 100-150 men and women to their payroll.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/362274552/ \"Toy Factory to be Opened in St. Joseph - Upton Machine Company Gets Contracts from Chain Store Groups\"], ''The Herald Press, Feb 20, 1928''</ref>\n\nOver the following 30 days, the company re-arranged and equipped the old air rifle plant with dies, tools, machines and other special equipment to increase production to 20,000 toys daily making it the largest manufacturer of toys in the middle west. One of the first toys produced was an \u201c''exact toy replica of the new [[Ford]]''\u201d. Other toys made in the new plant were tops, motor buses, trucks, wrecking trucks with crane, toy vans, express trucks and several other novelties.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/362274552/ \"Toy Factory to be Opened in St. Joseph - Upton Machine Company Gets Contracts from Chain Store Groups\"], ''The Herald Press, Feb 20, 1928''</ref>\n\nIn May 1928 the company announced record-high first quarter profits of approximately $75,000 along with a capital stock increase from 25,000 to 75,000. Stockholders were paid 100% dividends. Bassford, by then in very poor health, sold his interests in the company and resigned as its president, he passed away a few months later.<ref>Find A Grave,[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66760058/ \"Lowell Cary Bassford 1864-1928\"], ''Find A Grave''</ref> Louis was elected President and Frederick was elected Vice President and Secretary-Treasurer.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/363187414/ \"Whirlpool Corporation\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 30, 1957''</ref>\n\n===Merger with the Nineteen Hundred Co.===\nOn April 3, 1929 Louis announced that the Upton Machine Co will merge with the [[Nineteen Hundred Washer Company]] of [[Binghamton, New York]], one of the pioneers in the business and a concern that had been making washing machines since 1900, to create one of the leading units in the electric washing machine industry in the United States. [[Thomas W. Beham]], who had been President of the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company, assumed the same title in the newly formed [[Nineteen Hundred Corporation]]. Louis Upton became Vice President of the new combine and remained as Director and General Manager of the Upton division. Frederick became treasurer and a director of the new organization and [[Gus Keil]] remained as general superintendent and also became a director of the combine. Upton said in his announcement that the assets of the merged companies would total \u201cseveral million dollars.\u201d and that the idea of the merger originated with the Uptons. The outcome was a merger on an equal basis.

The concern now caters to some 4000 dealers throughout the nation. The Sears-Roebuck company gives the company preferential positioning in its catalog, which has a circulation of more than 11,000,000 households. Upton machines are also sold in all of the more than 300 Sears-Roebuck retail stores.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/362353536/ \"Upton Plant Doubled Their Output in 1929\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 31, 1929''</ref>\n\nOn October 29, 1929, the stock market collapsed on what became known as \"[[Black Tuesday]]\" launching the country into the [[Great Depression]]. By 1932, the country's national income was down 54% with more than 86,000 businesses failed, 4,835 banks closed and 12 million people were out of work. In November 1933, due to differences in business philosophies, particularly around the company's relationship with [[Sears]], Behan announced his resignation as President. Louis Upton is elected President of the Nineteen Hundred Corporation.<ref>\u201cMeeting The Challenge\u201d, ''Whirlpool a Century of Achievement: A New Century of Opportunity (2011) Page 31 Hardcover''</ref>\n\nDespite the country's hardships, the company remained resilient and the period of economic change turned out to be a good thing for the company, with fewer people being able to afford maids, doing the laundry at home became increasingly essential and unlike the boom years, price made a difference. Buyers turned to Sears for savings and bought Nineteen Hundred Co.\u2019s washers. The company was manufacturing about 25 percent of the washers and ironers sold in the country. In 1936, the company began exporting with Sears International to new important markets opening up for the Kenmore machines, primarily [[England]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Canal Zone]].<ref>The Herald Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/363138887 \"Upton\u2019s First Electric Washer \u2018Boomeranged\u2019, Production Lines That Have Made \u20181900\u2019 Corp.

Next, a sub-contract was accepted from the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix Aviation]] corporation for making propellor controls. This was the device that permitted faster take-offs and steeper climbs by fighters and bombers. Such controls usually were custom-made, but Nineteen Hundred Co. managed to do it on a mass-production assembly line basis.

His long leadership and his contribution to civic affairs is too well known to need recital here. As the founder and head of the Whirlpool Corporation, he directed the progress and development of the country's largest washing machine plant. In so many facets of his character and his local laborers, he typified my idea of outstanding citizenship. Here was a man who put small evaluation on the material phases of life. What he loved the most was his family his friends his hometown and the opportunity to serve his fellow citizens. He walked and labored with the great, the near great and the lowly. And through it all he remained humble and unspoiled. His was always was the human, considerate touch and approach. Wherever his influence and leadership was exerted, there will be genuine mourning\u201d''.<ref>The Herald-Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/363506264/ \"Leaders Of City Laud L.C Upton\"], ''The Herald-Press, Oct 10, 1952''</ref>\n\nAnother newspaper editorial stated: ''\u201c..He knew the bitterness of disappointed hopes as well as the satisfaction of accomplishment, and every setback so enriched his character that obstacles became stepping stones to success. Material success came to Mr. Upton, but it was always secondary and, it might be said, incidental. What he sought from life--and achieved--was the opportunity to be of service to his fellows and to his community. Particularly was he interested in helping youth--a desire stemming no doubt from his early struggles. He neglected no opportunity to assist young people up the ladder of citizenship and achievement. Mr. Upton counted his friends locally and over the nation by the hundreds. That is not surprising. He was selfless and unselfish in every contact. Material gains came his way because he earned them a thousand-fold. The community has lost a great citizen. He will be missed greatly, but from the foundations he helped build a better community will grow\u201d''.<ref>The News-Palladium,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/365649250/ \"Louis C.

Klein, the secretary-treasurer of the [[Commonwealth Edison]] company. Although Klein did not buy insurance, he was impressed by Upton and offered him a job, which Upton accepted. At Edison, Upton was introduced to the fast-developing field of electricity, and he became obsessed with the idea of making an electric washing machine. In 1908, Upton was approached by E.C. Williams, a hardware merchant in [[South Bend, Indiana]], who wanted to organize a company to manufacture home washers. Williams planned to open a factory in South Bend, and asked Upton to handle the sales department. Williams needed capital, and Upton offered the $500 he had saved. When the firm almost immediately went bankrupt. The owner, E.C. Williams, felt responsible for Louis' loss and told him he could take a patent of his choosing as compensation for his loss. Upton chose a patent on a hand-powered washing machine. Being a highly imaginative person, he thought the washer could someday have an electric motor attached to it.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n===Fabrication of the electric washer===\n[[File:Upton Electric by Upton Machine Company, 1912.png|thumb|Upton Electric by Upton Machine Co., 1912]]\nUpton was not deterred by the E.C.

This was not to be the first electric washing machine. Although the first electric washing machine is credited to A.J.

An Example of how Patents are Misused by Historians\"], ''Lee Maxwell, Feb 19, 2009''</ref>\n\nEventually, Emory Upton built a transmission that worked. Louis Upton took the electric washer to [[Federal Electric Company]], a company affiliated with Commonwealth Edison, and talked them into ordering 100 washers to be sold on the retail market for $85 each. He set up a shop in Benton Harbor where, with the help of his brother [[Frederick Upton|Frederick]], he built the electric washers while commuting to his job at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago, approximately 100 miles away. It was said that Louis painted the washers by hand, and Frederick crated them and took them by horse-drawn cart to the shipping point.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C.

However, a major problem arose: with daily use, the gears of every washer broke down. Federal Electric's president, John F. Gilchrist, summoned the 25-year-old Upton to his office and demanded the money back saying, \u201cYour product is a failure and money must be refunded to purchasers\u201d. Upton, ever confident and the salesman, replied that he would be happy to refund the money but he didn't then have any. He went on to explain that he had already spoken to Federal's master mechanic about a fix, and, with some time, could solve the problem. Federal agreed, and the master mechanic, Gustav B. Keil, who later came to work for Upton, solved the problem by using steel rather than cast iron in the gears. Describing the new gears, he told Upton, \"''They're O.K. I've used everything on them but an axe''\u201d. In the end, Federal Electric agreed with Keil and Upton emerged from disgrace with an order of 200 washers - but with new gears.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C.

This time he was really broke, but production was on the way up - producing 10 machines a day. He looked around for a financial backer, and he found one in a LaGrange friend and banker, Lowell C. Bassford. Bassford agreed to supply $5000 on the condition that Louis work for the company full-time, quitting his job at Commonwealth Edison. Thus was formed the Upton Machine Company on November 11, 1911 by Louis Upton, his uncle Emory Upton and Lowell Bassford. Louis took on the role as President, while Emory was Secretary and Treasurer. Louis\u2019 brother [[Frederick Upton|Frederick]] joined the company a few months later in 1912 as office manager. The company soon moved to a small building in the Edgewater area of [[St. Joseph, Michigan]]. In the beginning, Louis paid himself a salary of $10 a week while Fred received $8. Emory Upton was the high salaried man at $30 a week. Bassford had received 500 shares of stock in return for his capital, while Emory received 1,265 shares and Louis 1,000 shares in the new company.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C.

One reason may have been the experience involved in using the machine, which a newspaper described this way; \u201c''The hand washers of those days enabled a woman to rock back and forth in a chair as she pulled the handle which operated the rocking action of the washer. The electrified version of this washer was a fearful and wonderful object. It was a hand washer with a motor added, and power transmitted to the washing mechanism by means of a belt drive and cast iron gears. All the mechanism was exposed; all of it could get wet, and often did. The possibility of electrocution went practically hand-in-hand with the down payment. But it was electric. And it did work.''\u201d Weak initial demand for the electric washer may also have been due to a simple reluctance to change. The local newspaper summarized: \u201c''The company did not flourish as well as was expected, for there was but a meager demand for those hazardous contraptions, electric washing machines, and many women of the era felt that if wash tubs were good enough for grandma, they were good enough for them.''\u201d<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_News_Palladium,_Page_15_-_Oct_10,_1952.jpg \"Louis C.

Emory Upton's pay was lowered to $0.50/hour for all time put into the business. Louis were to receive salary not to exceed $15 per week as President. None of the workers pay were affected.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/363187414/ \"Whirlpool Corporation\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 30, 1957''</ref>\n\nAnother blow struck in early 1913 when the [[Federal Electric Company]], foreseeing wider acceptance for electric washers, decided to begin manufacturing the machines itself.

A deal was made with owner Frank Graves for Upton Machine Co. to take over the $25,000 mortgage and paid out another $25,000 in Upton Machine Co. stock. The deal came with fresh capital from [[Lowell C. Bassford]] who put in another $2,500 and another LaGrange man, [[Chas. F. Braffett]] who invested $10,000.

Temporarily, washers became a sidelight while air rifles kept the company afloat.

But at his first sales meeting with Sears, armed with an electric washer, Louis Upton came away with an order for 25 machines monthly, but sales were by catalog only. The business relationship with [[Sears]] planted a seed for its growth to the top of laundry manufacturers in the United States.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\nOn Oct 19, 1917 [[Chas. F. Braffett]], then President of Upton Machine Co. killed himself despondent of ill health.

The Upton Machine Co. building was too small to produce the order, so in 1921 Sears loaned the Upton Machine Co. $87,500 to add a building next to the original washer plant, extending in an \"L\" shape toward the west. But before any machines were built, the economy slumped and Sears canceled its order. The Upton Machine Co. now owed Sears $87,500 and had no way to repay it. Sears agreed to cancel the loan in exchange for shares of stock in the Upton Machine Co., a transaction that built a strong tie between the two companies. The washer plant addition was completed in 1924 and was equipped to make 100 washers a day, including at least 50 a day exclusively for Sears.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\nIn 1925 the economy had recovered and Sears agreed that the Upton Machine Co. would be its sole provider of washing machines. Upton had an idea; up to that point, Sears sold its products through its catalogue. Upton believed that major purchases such as washing machines needed expert face to face sales involvement and he sold the idea to former Brigader general [[Robert E. Wood]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company]]\u2019s president. Upton Machine Company began selling washers and ironers in Sears\u2019 80 retail locations. Upton Machine Company salesmen organized sales, set up displays, and trained Sears sales personnel. It was another turning point in the history of the Upton company\u2014in three years, the Sears sales of home laundry appliances jumped from 25,000 to 1,250,000 yearly.<ref>Herald Palladium,[https://www.heraldpalladium.com/localnews/the-whirlpool/article_053be1c7-aa70-5e93-81a6-8c2ed36fc806.html \"The Whirlpool\"], ''Herald Palladium, Jun 5, 2011''</ref>\n\n====Largest toy manufacturer in the Mid-West====\nOn February 20, 1928, the Upton Machine Co. announced a large contract to start mass production of light metal toys for the F.W. Woolworth and S. S. Kresge companies and several other large syndicate stores throughout the United States. To make room for the expansion in the toy manufacturing industry it sold its air rifle business to the [[All Metal Products Company]] of [[Detroit, Michigan]]. The same day Upton announced that the company planned to add from 100-150 men and women to their payroll.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/362274552/ \"Toy Factory to be Opened in St. Joseph - Upton Machine Company Gets Contracts from Chain Store Groups\"], ''The Herald Press, Feb 20, 1928''</ref>\n\nOver the following 30 days, the company re-arranged and equipped the old air rifle plant with dies, tools, machines and other special equipment to increase production to 20,000 toys daily making it the largest manufacturer of toys in the middle west. One of the first toys produced was an \u201c''exact toy replica of the new [[Ford]]''\u201d.

Stockholders were paid 100% dividends. Bassford, by then in very poor health, sold his interests in the company and resigned as its president, he passed away a few months later.<ref>Find A Grave,[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/66760058/ \"Lowell Cary Bassford 1864-1928\"], ''Find A Grave''</ref> Louis was elected President and Frederick was elected Vice President and Secretary-Treasurer.<ref>The Herald Press,[https://newspapers.com/image/363187414/ \"Whirlpool Corporation\"], ''The Herald Press, Dec 30, 1957''</ref>\n\n===Merger with the Nineteen Hundred Co.===\nOn April 3, 1929 Louis announced that the Upton Machine Co will merge with the [[Nineteen Hundred Washer Company]] of [[Binghamton, New York]], one of the pioneers in the business and a concern that had been making washing machines since 1900, to create one of the leading units in the electric washing machine industry in the United States. [[Thomas W. Beham]], who had been President of the Nineteen Hundred Washer Company, assumed the same title in the newly formed [[Nineteen Hundred Corporation]]. Louis Upton became Vice President of the new combine and remained as Director and General Manager of the Upton division. Frederick became treasurer and a director of the new organization and [[Gus Keil]] remained as general superintendent and also became a director of the combine. Upton said in his announcement that the assets of the merged companies would total \u201cseveral million dollars.\u201d and that the idea of the merger originated with the Uptons. The outcome was a merger on an equal basis.

By 1932, the country's national income was down 54% with more than 86,000 businesses failed, 4,835 banks closed and 12 million people were out of work. In November 1933, due to differences in business philosophies, particularly around the company's relationship with [[Sears]], Behan announced his resignation as President.

Buyers turned to Sears for savings and bought Nineteen Hundred Co.\u2019s washers. The company was manufacturing about 25 percent of the washers and ironers sold in the country. In 1936, the company began exporting with Sears International to new important markets opening up for the Kenmore machines, primarily [[England]], [[Sweden]] and the [[Canal Zone]].<ref>The Herald Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/363138887 \"Upton\u2019s First Electric Washer \u2018Boomeranged\u2019, Production Lines That Have Made \u20181900\u2019 Corp.

By 1941, the company was seeing record sales of 262,000 washers and ironers yielding over $10 million in sales.

In May 1942, the last washing machine came off the assembly line. From then until the war ended, production was strictly military. The first war contract was for machining and assembling gun mounts. Next, a sub-contract was accepted from the [[Bendix Corporation|Bendix Aviation]] corporation for making propellor controls. This was the device that permitted faster take-offs and steeper climbs by fighters and bombers. Such controls usually were custom-made, but Nineteen Hundred Co. managed to do it on a mass-production assembly line basis. The firm turned out 3,000 units a month and received the highest inspection rating the army and navy could bestow.<ref>\u201cMeeting The Challenge\u201d, ''Whirlpool a Century of Achievement: A New Century of Opportunity (2011) Page 31 Hardcover''</ref><ref>The Herald Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/363138887 \"Upton\u2019s First Electric Washer \u2018Boomeranged\u2019, Production Lines That Have Made \u20181900\u2019 Corp.

He had plans to design and engineer a fully automatic spinner-type washer. Throughout the war the company made 25 major refinements and after going through 50 working models, the postwar planning had lined up so well that the first washer base to be assembled after the war was put together the day before the Japanese surrendered.

In so many facets of his character and his local laborers, he typified my idea of outstanding citizenship. Here was a man who put small evaluation on the material phases of life. What he loved the most was his family his friends his hometown and the opportunity to serve his fellow citizens. He walked and labored with the great, the near great and the lowly. And through it all he remained humble and unspoiled. His was always was the human, considerate touch and approach. Wherever his influence and leadership was exerted, there will be genuine mourning\u201d''.<ref>The Herald-Press,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/363506264/ \"Leaders Of City Laud L.C Upton\"], ''The Herald-Press, Oct 10, 1952''</ref>\n\nAnother newspaper editorial stated: ''\u201c..He knew the bitterness of disappointed hopes as well as the satisfaction of accomplishment, and every setback so enriched his character that obstacles became stepping stones to success. Material success came to Mr. Upton, but it was always secondary and, it might be said, incidental. What he sought from life--and achieved--was the opportunity to be of service to his fellows and to his community. Particularly was he interested in helping youth--a desire stemming no doubt from his early struggles. He neglected no opportunity to assist young people up the ladder of citizenship and achievement. Mr. Upton counted his friends locally and over the nation by the hundreds. That is not surprising. He was selfless and unselfish in every contact. Material gains came his way because he earned them a thousand-fold. The community has lost a great citizen. He will be missed greatly, but from the foundations he helped build a better community will grow\u201d''.<ref>The News-Palladium,[https://heraldpalladium.newspapers.com/image/365649250/ \"Louis C.

Murphy''''' (previously known as '''''Carpenter v. Murphy''''' and '''''Royal v. Murphy''''') is a [[List of pending United States Supreme Court cases|pending case]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and raises the question of whether [[United States Congress|Congress]] disestablished the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] reservation.\n\nIn 1866, Congress established [[Indian reservation|reservation]] boundaries for the Muscogee (Creek), Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole Nations. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation boundaries composes three million acres in Eastern Oklahoma, including most of the city of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. The boundaries for all five nations consist of over 19 million acres and nearly the entire eastern half of Oklahoma.  In 1907, Congress [[Admission to the Union|admitted Oklahoma to the Union]] as the [[Oklahoma|46th state]] and [[United States territorial court|federal territorial courts]] immediately transferred all non-federal cases involving Native Americans to state courts.<ref name=\"supremecourt.gov\">[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1107/55210/20180723232225994_17-1107ts.pdf Brief for Petitioner]</ref> However, in the process, it has been found that Congress never officially disestablished the tribal reservations, a requirement for a tribal reservation to lose that status as demanded under ''[[Solem v. Bartlett]]'' (1984).<ref name=Solem>{{ussc|name=Solem v. Bartlett|465|463|1984}}.</ref>\n\nThe situation arose following the appeal of a convicted murderer, Patrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee tribe, with his crime taking place within the historical boundaries of Muscogee reservation. The appeal addressed whether the federal territorial courts had congressional authorization to make this transfer, as if the lands were still a tribal reservation, Murphy's crime would become subject to federal jurisdiction rather than Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/11/argument-preview-justices-to-turn-again-to-rules-for-disestablishing-tribal-reservations/|title=Argument preview: Justices to turn again to rules for disestablishing tribal reservations|last= Mann |first= Ronald |date= November 20, 2018 |website=scotusblog.com|access-date= November 21, 2018}}</ref> Although this case is specific to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Court's decision is likely to also apply to reservations of the [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]], and [[Seminole]] Nations because all five tribes have similar histories within the state of Oklahoma.\n\nThe case was first heard by the Supreme Court in its 2018-2019 term; Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]] recused himself due to having participated as a federal appellate judge when the case was heard in lower courts, which has created a potential deadlock between the remaining eight Justices. The Supreme Court announced at the end of the term that it will hold additional oral arguments during the 2019 term, though these have yet to be scheduled as of March 2020.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File: Boundaries of the Five Tribes in 1866.jpg |thumb|300px|right|Boundaries of the Five Tribes in 1866]]\nFrom the colonial and early federal period in the [[history of the United States]] the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Muscogee (Creek)]], and [[Seminole]] Nations became known as the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].<ref>Clinton, Fred S.

The migration from these homelands to the designated territory is infamously known as the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[American Civil War]], some of the tribes supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]].  After the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory, the \u201cFive Tribes\u201d ceded all its territory in western Oklahoma.  The Muscogee (Creek)\u2019s present boundaries reflect two cessions.

Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The [[Curtis Act of 1898]] amended the Dawes Act to extend its provisions to the Five Civilized Tribes; it required abolition of their governments, allotment of communal lands to people registered as tribal members, and sale of lands declared surplus, as well as dissolving tribal courts.\n\nThe Muscogee (Creek) Nation reached a negotiated agreement with the federal government for the allotment of tribal lands, and Congress passed it into law in 1901. The original agreement specified that its terms would control over conflicting federal statutes and treaty provisions, but it in no way affected treaty provisions consistent with the agreement. The agreement's central purpose was to facilitate a transfer of title from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation generally to its members individually. It provided that \"[a]ll lands belonging to the Creek tribe,\" except for town sites and lands reserved for public purposes, should be appraised and allotted \"among the citizens of the tribe.\"<ref>''Murphy'', 866 F.3d at 1209.</ref> In 1906, Congress passed the The [[Oklahoma Enabling Act]],<ref name=\"EA1906\">{{USStatute|59|234|34|267|1906|6|16|H.R.|12707}}</ref> which empowered the people residing in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Oklahoma Territory]] to elect delegates to a state constitutional convention and subsequently to be admitted to the union as a single union. The question before the Supreme Court is whether these laws and other similar federal statutes clearly disestablished the reservation of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\n==Statement of the Case==\nPatrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, murdered George Jacobs near Henryetta, Oklahoma on August 28, 1999. He confessed to the murder to Mr. Jacobs' former acquaintance, Ms. Patsy Jacobs, whom he was living with, and was arrested. An Oklahoma state court jury convicted Patrick Murphy of murder in and imposed the death penalty in 2000.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Murphy v.

The state district court concluded state jurisdiction was proper because the crime had occurred on state land. Murphy appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals which also determined that the state had jurisdiction. Murphy then sought ''[[Habeas corpus|Habeas]]'' relief in the Federal District Court of Eastern Oklahoma. The Federal District Court determined the Oklahoma state court decisions were not contrary to federal law and denied the ''Habeas'' petition.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Murphy v.

Murphy''''' (previously known as '''''Carpenter v. Murphy''''' and '''''Royal v. Murphy''''') is a [[List of pending United States Supreme Court cases|pending case]] before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] and raises the question of whether [[United States Congress|Congress]] disestablished the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation]] reservation.\n\nIn 1866, Congress established [[Indian reservation|reservation]] boundaries for the Muscogee (Creek), Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole Nations. The Muscogee (Creek) Nation boundaries composes three million acres in Eastern Oklahoma, including most of the city of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]]. The boundaries for all five nations consist of over 19 million acres and nearly the entire eastern half of Oklahoma.  In 1907, Congress [[Admission to the Union|admitted Oklahoma to the Union]] as the [[Oklahoma|46th state]] and [[United States territorial court|federal territorial courts]] immediately transferred all non-federal cases involving Native Americans to state courts.<ref name=\"supremecourt.gov\">[https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1107/55210/20180723232225994_17-1107ts.pdf Brief for Petitioner]</ref> However, in the process, it has been found that Congress never officially disestablished the tribal reservations, a requirement for a tribal reservation to lose that status as demanded under ''[[Solem v. Bartlett]]'' (1984).<ref name=Solem>{{ussc|name=Solem v. Bartlett|465|463|1984}}.</ref>\n\nThe situation arose following the appeal of a convicted murderer, Patrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee tribe, with his crime taking place within the historical boundaries of Muscogee reservation. The appeal addressed whether the federal territorial courts had congressional authorization to make this transfer, as if the lands were still a tribal reservation, Murphy's crime would become subject to federal jurisdiction rather than Oklahoma.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2018/11/argument-preview-justices-to-turn-again-to-rules-for-disestablishing-tribal-reservations/|title=Argument preview: Justices to turn again to rules for disestablishing tribal reservations|last= Mann |first= Ronald |date= November 20, 2018 |website=scotusblog.com|access-date= November 21, 2018}}</ref> Although this case is specific to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, the Court's decision is likely to also apply to reservations of the [[Cherokee]], [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]], and [[Seminole]] Nations because all five tribes have similar histories within the state of Oklahoma.\n\nThe case was first heard by the Supreme Court in its 2018-2019 term; Justice [[Neil Gorsuch]] recused himself due to having participated as a federal appellate judge when the case was heard in lower courts, which has created a potential deadlock between the remaining eight Justices. The Supreme Court announced at the end of the term that it will hold additional oral arguments during the 2019 term, thought these have yet to be scheduled as of March 2020.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File: Boundaries of the Five Tribes in 1866.jpg |thumb|300px|right|Boundaries of the Five Tribes in 1866]]\nFrom the colonial and early federal period in the [[history of the United States]] the [[Cherokee]], [[Chickasaw]], [[Choctaw]], [[Muscogee|Muscogee (Creek)]], and [[Seminole]] Nations became known as the [[Five Civilized Tribes]].<ref>Clinton, Fred S.

The migration from these homelands to the designated territory is infamously known as the [[Trail of Tears]]. During the [[American Civil War]], some of the tribes supported the [[Confederate States of America|Confederates]].  After the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory, the \u201cFive Tribes\u201d ceded all its territory in western Oklahoma.  The Muscogee (Creek)\u2019s present boundaries reflect two cessions.

Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The [[Curtis Act of 1898]] amended the Dawes Act to extend its provisions to the Five Civilized Tribes; it required abolition of their governments, allotment of communal lands to people registered as tribal members, and sale of lands declared surplus, as well as dissolving tribal courts.\n\nThe Muscogee (Creek) Nation reached a negotiated agreement with the federal government for the allotment of tribal lands, and Congress passed it into law in 1901. The original agreement specified that its terms would control over conflicting federal statutes and treaty provisions, but it in no way affected treaty provisions consistent with the agreement. The agreement's central purpose was to facilitate a transfer of title from the Muscogee (Creek) Nation generally to its members individually. It provided that \"[a]ll lands belonging to the Creek tribe,\" except for town sites and lands reserved for public purposes, should be appraised and allotted \"among the citizens of the tribe.\"<ref>''Murphy'', 866 F.3d at 1209.</ref> In 1906, Congress passed the The [[Oklahoma Enabling Act]],<ref name=\"EA1906\">{{USStatute|59|234|34|267|1906|6|16|H.R.|12707}}</ref> which empowered the people residing in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Oklahoma Territory]] to elect delegates to a state constitutional convention and subsequently to be admitted to the union as a single union. The question before the Supreme Court is whether these laws and other similar federal statutes clearly disestablished the reservation of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation.\n\n==Statement of the Case==\nPatrick Murphy, a member of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, murdered George Jacobs near Henryetta, Oklahoma on August 28, 1999. He confessed to the murder to Mr. Jacobs' former acquaintance, Ms. Patsy Jacobs, whom he was living with, and was arrested. An Oklahoma state court jury convicted Patrick Murphy of murder in and imposed the death penalty in 2000.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Murphy v.

The state district court concluded state jurisdiction was proper because the crime had occurred on state land. Murphy appealed to the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals which also determined that the state had jurisdiction. Murphy then sought ''[[Habeas corpus|Habeas]]'' relief in the Federal District Court of Eastern Oklahoma. The Federal District Court determined the Oklahoma state court decisions were not contrary to federal law and denied the ''Habeas'' petition.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Murphy v.

''The Little Nyonya'' was notable for having the highest production budget in the history of MediaCorp due to the elaborate period costumes. A pair of beaded shoes traversed over a cost of SGD$1200, while a dining table acquired for the set cost $15000.\n\nRumours indicate that the role of Xiufeng was initially offered to May Phua, who turned the offer down due to her pregnancy at the time of filming. [[Huang Biren]] was said to be a prime candidate for the role of Tian Lan, although the actress' decision not to renew her contract with MediaCorp ultimately resulted in [[Xiang Yun]] obtaining the part. It was also rumoured that [[Zoe Tay]] had expressed interest in portraying a role in the series, although there were no suitable roles for her. [[Andrew Seow]] was first choice to play Robert Zhang but he declined due to scheduling conflicts and the role went to [[Zzen Zhang]].\n\nThe series initially received a 30-episode order, although over-runs in filming led the series to be extended to 34 episodes instead. Possibly as a result, two episodes were aired on Mondays from December 15, 2008 till the conclusion of the series.\n\n==Promotion==\nPromotion for ''The Little Nyonya'' lasted throughout the initial broadcast of the series as well after the series ended. Twelve members of the cast participated in \"The Little Nyonya Public Event\" \u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u6237\u5916\u5f71\u8ff7\u4f1a at [[Compass Point Shopping Centre|Compass Point]] on December 27, 2008, which included an autograph session. An estimated 5000 people were present during the event. 100 posters were given out to members of the audience. The unprecedented number of appearances resulted in damage of the flooring at Compass Point. Certain tiles on the floor cracked under the pressure exerted by the crowd.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://returnofthepangies.blogspot.com/2009/01/little-nynonya-roadshow.html\n |title       = the little nyonya roadshow (27 dec)\n |author      = [https://www.blogger.com/profile/12726970407925860548 pangizes]\n |date        = 2009-01-02\n |publisher   = [[Blogspot]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://returnofthepangies.blogspot.com/2009/01/little-nynonya-roadshow.html&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://wubingyu.blogspot.com/2009/01/be-manager.html\n |title       = \"The Little Nonya\" Road Show and Meet-the-Fans Session\n |author      = [http://www.blogger.com/profile/17721701971793973490 wubingyu]\n |date        = 2009-01-08\n |publisher   = [[Blogspot]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://wubingyu.blogspot.com/2009/01/be-manager.html&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.simplyjeanette.com/2008/12/27/thousands-turn-up-at-little-nyonya-roadshow/\n |title       = Thousands turn up at \"Little Nyonya\" roadshow\n |author      = [[Channel NewsAsia]]\n |date        = 2008-12-27\n |publisher   = [[Jeanette Aw]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.simplyjeanette.com/2008/12/27/thousands-turn-up-at-little-nyonya-roadshow/&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2015-06-26 | url=https://www.facebook.com/22268538302/photos/ms.c.eJxVkssNBDEIQzta8Qsh~;Te2mcPAm5tlGcc4hHnsCnexX5gvlaoXi~_4a~;rzYjxo0rb8~_q3F5jaeqjyag2fB06GVw9VuBdx~;s43N8~_PaxykS2hP6TGbOKvbKQoT3X9HA1jS2t93X4PHxNno1s3ZUt9HPzs3~;ugk7YjyBn~_1i6TGb94NYb~_fn3O0sfZX7eAPvnnTz8H6nVdvo~-.bps.a.42323353302/42325103302/ | title=The Little Nyonya Roadshow ~ 27 Dec 2008 | publisher=The Little Nyonya's Facebook Page | date=2008-12-29 | author=The Little Nyonya}}</ref>\n\nDue to the overwhelming response of the initial public event, a \"Thank You Roadshow\" was held at Suntec City on January 31, where fans were allowed to take photographs with the cast and then shake hands.

The viewership peaked at 33.8% on the final two episodes, also broadcast back-to-back.\n\n==Critical response==\n''The Little Nyonya'' has been critically acclaimed. However, despite being lauded as a drama that provides an insight into the unique Peranakan culture, the show has received criticism in local media over portrayals and promotion. Issues that were raised early included the castings of Pan Lingling and Cynthia Koh to portray teenage girls albeit being already in their thirties. This issue was counter-argued by being tantamount to ageism, as well as the fact that it was raised only three episodes after the show began airing.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://showbiz.omy.sg:80/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011021-25934.html | title=\u6f58\u73b2\u73b2\u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u6f14\u5c11\u5973 \u89c2\u4f17\u5acc\u8001 | publisher=Lianhe Wanbao | work=omy.sg | date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=9 May 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142216/http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011021-25934.html | archivedate=17 March 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref> The character development of Xiufeng has come under fire due to the character's exhibitions of violence.\n\nCriticism was also leveled at MediaCorp's bias towards Jeanette Aw. Many viewers saw ''The Little Nyonya'' as a television series conceived as a launching vehicle for Aw's career in television and to secure an award at the next Star Awards. Several viewers also believe that the producers intentionally wrote Aw's first role as a mute in attempt to conceal her imperfect delivery of Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://showbiz.omy.sg:80/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011129-25999.html | script-title=zh:\u5b89\u6392\u6b27\u8431\u6f14\u54d1\u5df4 \u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u5267\u7ec4\u523b\u610f\u2018\u85cf\u62d9\u2019 | publisher=Lianhe Wanbao | work=omy.sg | date=29 November 2008 | accessdate=9 May 2017 | language=Chinese | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215014103/http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011129-25999.html | archivedate=15 February 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref> In response, producers have lauded Aw's work, saying that she performed in a professional manner.

Within MediaCorp, there are also some misgivings in regards to the over-promotion this show has received. The cast of the long-running drama [[Love Blossoms]] have privately lamented that the show, which used to receive tremendous amounts of advertising support from MediaCorp, is being neglected in favour of The Little Nyonya.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812041059-26206.html | title=\u957f\u5bff\u5267vs\u53f0\u5e86\u5267: \u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u5ba3\u4f20\u8fc7\u731b\u3000\u300a\u5fc3\u82b1\u6735\u67352\u300b\u88ab\u51b7\u843d | publisher=Shin Min Daily News (carried on omy.sg) | date=3 December 2008 | accessdate=2008-12-22 | language=Chinese | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126084726/http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812041059-26206.html | archivedate=26 January 2016 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs many of the Peranakan characters in the series (such as most of the Huang family, as well as Charlie Zhang and son Robert) are antagonists (Jincheng, Xiufeng and Huangyuan are part-time antagonists), many viewers think that the series will negatively stereotype Peranakans as being ruthless. In response, the show's writer, Ang Eng Tee, said that ruthlessness and petty politicking, which are basic human interactions, appears within any culture, and is not an exclusive trait of the Peranakans.<ref name=\"criticism2\"/>\n\nDue to the usage of [[dramatic license]], the series also contains a significant number of historical inaccuracies, particularly in the first few episodes involving Juxiang's life and Yueniang's childhood. Notable examples include the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1932 (as opposed to 1937) and the [[Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|first air raid on Singapore]] (8 December 1941) occurring in broad daylight (which took place at night in reality).\n\n===The Little Nyonya: The Final Chapter===\nThe scriptwriter of the series, Ang Eng Tee (also known as Hong Rongdi \u6d2a\u8363\u72c4), plotted five endings for the series, four of which would involve Yueniang and Chen Xi reuniting and living happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_322570.html?vgnmr=1|title=How should it have ended? |date=6 January 2009|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe ending used in the series was criticised by fans to be too sad and abrupt.

Yueniang and Chen Xi ended up separated, just as it was in the original ending.

Rather, it is a special presentation to show the station's appreciation to the fans of the series.<ref name=\"ending2\"/>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nThis drama was seen as an extremely strong contender in the ''[[Star Awards 2009]]'', held on 26 April 2009, minting a new record of having 16 nominations in the acting category, surpassing former record holder's ''[[Holland V (TV Series)|Holland V]]'' (which got nine) until it was topped by the [[The Dream Makers (TV series)|first season of ''The Dream Makers'']] in [[Star Awards 20|2014]], which have 21. The series became the biggest winner for the ceremony, taking home nine awards including the [[Star Awards for Best Drama Serial|Drama Serial]] and the Top Viewership Drama Serial of 2008 (tying with the first season of ''The Dream Makers'' later in 2014); it was at the time the series won the most number of awards in a ''Star Awards'' ceremony until in the [[Star Awards 2016|2016 ceremony]], the record was superseded by the [[The Dream Makers II|second season of ''The Dream Makers'']], which received [[The Dream Makers II#Awards and nominations|26 nominations, and won 12]].\n\nThe spin-off series, ''The Little Nyonya Reunion Special'', and the promotional ad for the encore telecast for the series, were respectively nominated for ''[[Star Awards 2010]]'' and ''[[Star Awards 2011]]'', with the latter clinching the award.\n\nOn total, the entire ''Little Nyonya'' franchise won a combined 11 awards from four award ceremonies.\n\n===[[Star Awards 2009]]===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Accolades!!

It was notably parodied in the variety show, ''[[Black Rose (Singaporean TV series)|Black Rose]]''. In the episode when the encore started its debut, [[Chen Hanwei]] played Liu Yidao (\u7559\u4e00\u5200) and [[Dennis Chew]] portrayed Yamamoto Yue Niang (\u5c71\u672c\u6708\u5a18). It was also used in the skit segment of [[Star Search 2010]] Grand Finals in which contestants played Liu Yidao, Yuzhu, Ah Tao and Robert Zhang.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Lianhe Wanbao]]'', the series' scriptwriter, Ang Eng Tee, said that if the demand exists, he will write a special presentation, or even a sequel to the series. Ideas for a possible sequel or special presentation have already been drafted by Ang, one of which would have Angela receiving a secret wooden box from Ah Tao, before Angela returns to Singapore. The box was owned by Yueniang, and Ah Tao defied her orders to burn the contents before Yueniang died. The box contained details on Yueniang and Chen Xi's relationship, in addition to a letter from Libby, telling Yueniang that Chen Xi and Libby did not get married after all.<ref name=\"ending2\"/> However, it was noted that production sequels have been much frowned upon by producers, and owing to the high production costs, a sequel seems to be very unlikely, but another drama in 2010 [[Unriddle]] is having a sequel to the original in 2012.\n\n===''The Peranakan Ball''===\nOn May 16, 2009, Jeanette Aw and Dai Yangtian starred in a musical called The Peranakan Ball ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5a18\u60f9\u4e4b\u604b). The musical is based on the story of Cinderella and it stars Jeanette Aw as Bee Tin, a Nyonya servant in a wealthy Peranakan household, and unrelated to the television series, even though the concept was clearly derived from the drama.<ref name=\"musical\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/426296/1/.html|title=\"\"The Peranakan Ball\" musical set for May 16|last=CNA|first=CNA|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=2009-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502192407/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/426296/1/.html|archive-date=2009-05-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===''Pretty Maid''===\nWhile not promoted as such, and the program was produced by a different television station, many Singaporeans who watched the series ''{{Interlanguage link|Pretty Maid|lt=|zh|\u5927\u4e2b\u9b1f|WD=}}'' believe it copies the main plot of The Little Nyonya.

''The Little Nyonya'' was notable for having the highest production budget in the history of MediaCorp due to the elaborate period costumes. A pair of beaded shoes traversed over a cost of SGD$1200, while a dining table acquired for the set cost $15000.\n\nRumours indicate that the role of Xiufeng was initially offered to May Phua, who turned the offer down due to her pregnancy at the time of filming. [[Huang Biren]] was said to be a prime candidate for the role of Tian Lan, although the actress' decision not to renew her contract with MediaCorp ultimately resulted in [[Xiang Yun]] obtaining the part. It was also rumoured that [[Zoe Tay]] had expressed interest in portraying a role in the series, although there were no suitable roles for her. [[Andrew Seow]] was first choice to play Robert Zhang but he declined due to scheduling conflicts and the role went to [[Zzen Zhang]].\n\nThe series initially received a 30-episode order, although over-runs in filming led the series to be extended to 34 episodes instead. Possibly as a result, two episodes were aired on Mondays from December 15, 2008 till the conclusion of the series.\n\n==Promotion==\nPromotion for ''The Little Nyonya'' lasted throughout the initial broadcast of the series as well after the series ended. Twelve members of the cast participated in \"The Little Nyonya Public Event\" \u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u6237\u5916\u5f71\u8ff7\u4f1a at [[Compass Point Shopping Centre|Compass Point]] on December 27, 2008, which included an autograph session. An estimated 5000 people were present during the event. 100 posters were given out to members of the audience. The unprecedented number of appearances resulted in damage of the flooring at Compass Point. Certain tiles on the floor cracked under the pressure exerted by the crowd.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://returnofthepangies.blogspot.com/2009/01/little-nynonya-roadshow.html\n |title       = the little nyonya roadshow (27 dec)\n |author      = [https://www.blogger.com/profile/12726970407925860548 pangizes]\n |date        = 2009-01-02\n |publisher   = [[Blogspot]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://returnofthepangies.blogspot.com/2009/01/little-nynonya-roadshow.html&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://wubingyu.blogspot.com/2009/01/be-manager.html\n |title       = \"The Little Nonya\" Road Show and Meet-the-Fans Session\n |author      = [http://www.blogger.com/profile/17721701971793973490 wubingyu]\n |date        = 2009-01-08\n |publisher   = [[Blogspot]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://wubingyu.blogspot.com/2009/01/be-manager.html&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.simplyjeanette.com/2008/12/27/thousands-turn-up-at-little-nyonya-roadshow/\n |title       = Thousands turn up at \"Little Nyonya\" roadshow\n |author      = [[Channel NewsAsia]]\n |date        = 2008-12-27\n |publisher   = [[Jeanette Aw]]\n |access-date = 2015-06-26\n |archivedate = 2015-06-26\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.simplyjeanette.com/2008/12/27/thousands-turn-up-at-little-nyonya-roadshow/&date=2015-06-26\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2015-06-26 | url=https://www.facebook.com/22268538302/photos/ms.c.eJxVkssNBDEIQzta8Qsh~;Te2mcPAm5tlGcc4hHnsCnexX5gvlaoXi~_4a~;rzYjxo0rb8~_q3F5jaeqjyag2fB06GVw9VuBdx~;s43N8~_PaxykS2hP6TGbOKvbKQoT3X9HA1jS2t93X4PHxNno1s3ZUt9HPzs3~;ugk7YjyBn~_1i6TGb94NYb~_fn3O0sfZX7eAPvnnTz8H6nVdvo~-.bps.a.42323353302/42325103302/ | title=The Little Nyonya Roadshow ~ 27 Dec 2008 | publisher=The Little Nyonya's Facebook Page | date=2008-12-29 | author=The Little Nyonya}}</ref>\n\nDue to the overwhelming response of the initial public event, a \"Thank You Roadshow\" was held at Suntec City on January 31, where fans were allowed to take photographs with the cast and then shake hands. It featured several cast members from the first event as well as Olivia Ong, who recorded the theme song of the series.\n\nMinor roadshows were held at various locations between January and April 2009. On January 17, Jeanette Aw and Xiang Yun promoted bird nest at Tiong Bahru Plaza, while Qi Yuwu and Joanne Peh appeared at Courts Megastore along Tampines Road. Qi and Peh later appeared in character as part of the official launch for Media Fiesta at Marina Square on March 5. On April 26, Aw and Pierre Png made an appearance at the first anniversary of the Singapore Peranakan Museum shortly before leaving to attend the Star Awards.\n\n===Chinese New Year Special===\nIn response the tremendous support to the show, the producers filmed a one-hour special, showcasing the stars enjoying a special Nyonya's reunion dinner, \"The Little Nyonya's Big Reunion\" ({{zh|c=\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u5927\u56e2\u5706}}), which was aired on day one of the Lunar New Year (26 January 2009) at 7 pm. It was hosted by [[Dasmond Koh]] and featured [[Yan Bingliang]], [[Lin Meijiao]], [[Pan Lingling]], [[Darren Lim]], [[Li Yinzhu]], [[Cynthia Koh]], [[Eelyn Kok]], [[Andie Chen]], [[Joanne Peh]], [[Zzen Zhang]], [[Dai Yangtian]], [[Jeanette Aw]], [[Xiang Yun]], [[Pierre Png]], [[Qi Yuwu]], [[Ng Hui]] and [[Yao Wenlong]]. The cast talked about the filming experiences and about the unexplained fates of characters that were not mentioned in the finale. Unaired [[blooper]] clips and behind-the-scenes shots were also shown. The special also had a special re-run on February 8, 2009 (day 14 of the New Year) at 9 pm.\n\n===Home media release===\nThe series was released by MediaCorp a 2-volume DVD boxset. The first volume, which contained the first 12 episodes of ''The Little Nyonya'' was released to stores on January 6, 2009. The remaining episodes were compiled in the second volume and released two weeks later.<ref name=\"DVD release\"/> The boxset contains no special features, although it is accompanied by a booklet which provides descriptions of the major characters in the show, as well as a family tree.\n\n==Commercial performance==\n''The Little Nyonya'' achieved extremely high ratings during its initial run, with an average of 993 000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/399476/1/.html|title=MediaCorp Ch8's \"The Little Nyonya\" is highest rated series in 15 years|last=Frois|first=Cheryl|date=31 December 2008|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=2009-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116120652/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/399476/1/.html|archive-date=2009-01-16|url-status=live}}</ref> per episode and peaking at 1.67 million viewers on the final episode.<ref name=\"DVD release\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediacorptv.sg/en/buzzdetail/EDC090107-0000007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116170056/http://mediacorptv.sg/en/buzzdetail/EDC090107-0000007|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 January 2009|title=Catch The Little Nyonya again on DVD|date=7 January 2009|publisher=MediaCorp TV|accessdate=2009-01-09}}</ref> In addition, the series achieved the highest viewership rating in Singapore in 14 years.\n\nViewership for ''The Little Nyonya'' steadily increased throughout its run. Its first episode garnered an estimated 1.098 million viewers, which equates to 20.3% of the country population. On Episode 11, the show rating increased to 23.6%. The 15th and 16th episodes, both broadcast back-to-back, was watched by 24.1% of the country's population. The rating increased by 2.2% a week later, and further increased to 27.8% by the 27th and 28th episodes. The viewership peaked at 33.8% on the final two episodes, also broadcast back-to-back.\n\n==Critical response==\n''The Little Nyonya'' has been critically acclaimed. However, despite being lauded as a drama that provides an insight into the unique Peranakan culture, the show has received criticism in local media over portrayals and promotion. Issues that were raised early included the castings of Pan Lingling and Cynthia Koh to portray teenage girls albeit being already in their thirties. This issue was counter-argued by being tantamount to ageism, as well as the fact that it was raised only three episodes after the show began airing.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://showbiz.omy.sg:80/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011021-25934.html | title=\u6f58\u73b2\u73b2\u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u6f14\u5c11\u5973 \u89c2\u4f17\u5acc\u8001 | publisher=Lianhe Wanbao | work=omy.sg | date=28 November 2008 | accessdate=9 May 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317142216/http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011021-25934.html | archivedate=17 March 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref> The character development of Xiufeng has come under fire due to the character's exhibitions of violence.\n\nCriticism was also leveled at MediaCorp's bias towards Jeanette Aw. Many viewers saw ''The Little Nyonya'' as a television series conceived as a launching vehicle for Aw's career in television and to secure an award at the next Star Awards. Several viewers also believe that the producers intentionally wrote Aw's first role as a mute in attempt to conceal her imperfect delivery of Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://showbiz.omy.sg:80/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011129-25999.html | script-title=zh:\u5b89\u6392\u6b27\u8431\u6f14\u54d1\u5df4 \u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u5267\u7ec4\u523b\u610f\u2018\u85cf\u62d9\u2019 | publisher=Lianhe Wanbao | work=omy.sg | date=29 November 2008 | accessdate=9 May 2017 | language=Chinese | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215014103/http://showbiz.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812011129-25999.html | archivedate=15 February 2010 | url-status=dead}}</ref> In response, producers have lauded Aw's work, saying that she performed in a professional manner.

Within MediaCorp, there are also some misgivings in regards to the over-promotion this show has received. The cast of the long-running drama [[Love Blossoms]] have privately lamented that the show, which used to receive tremendous amounts of advertising support from MediaCorp, is being neglected in favour of The Little Nyonya.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812041059-26206.html | title=\u957f\u5bff\u5267vs\u53f0\u5e86\u5267: \u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u5ba3\u4f20\u8fc7\u731b\u3000\u300a\u5fc3\u82b1\u6735\u67352\u300b\u88ab\u51b7\u843d | publisher=Shin Min Daily News (carried on omy.sg) | date=3 December 2008 | accessdate=2008-12-22 | language=Chinese | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126084726/http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200812041059-26206.html | archivedate=26 January 2016 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAs many of the Peranakan characters in the series (such as most of the Huang family, as well as Charlie Zhang and son Robert) are antagonists (Jincheng, Xiufeng and Huangyuan are part-time antagonists), many viewers think that the series will negatively stereotype Peranakans as being ruthless. In response, the show's writer, Ang Eng Tee, said that ruthlessness and petty politicking, which are basic human interactions, appears within any culture, and is not an exclusive trait of the Peranakans.<ref name=\"criticism2\"/>\n\nDue to the usage of [[dramatic license]], the series also contains a significant number of historical inaccuracies, particularly in the first few episodes involving Juxiang's life and Yueniang's childhood. Notable examples include the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1932 (as opposed to 1937) and the [[Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|first air raid on Singapore]] (8 December 1941) occurring in broad daylight (which took place at night in reality).\n\n===The Little Nyonya: The Final Chapter===\nThe scriptwriter of the series, Ang Eng Tee (also known as Hong Rongdi \u6d2a\u8363\u72c4), plotted five endings for the series, four of which would involve Yueniang and Chen Xi reuniting and living happily ever after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_322570.html?vgnmr=1|title=How should it have ended? |date=6 January 2009|publisher=The Straits Times|accessdate=2009-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nThe ending used in the series was criticised by fans to be too sad and abrupt. The response also prompted Ang to say that had he know that viewers would react as such, he would have Yueniang and Chen Xi reunite, for TV dramas are, in his words, made for viewers.<ref name=\"sadending\">{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_322946.html |title=Where's the happy ending? |last=Lee |first=Jocelyn |author2=Jasmine Teo |date=7 January 2009 |publisher=The Straits Times |accessdate=2009-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090121162643/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_322946.html |archivedate=January 21, 2009 }}</ref> In response to the criticisms, MediaCorp decided to make an alternate ending, which was aired on 11 January 2009 at 9.55pm.

Yueniang and Chen Xi ended up separated, just as it was in the original ending. This drew heavy criticism from viewers, who told local newspapers that they felt they were being cheated.<ref name=\"ending2\">{{cite web | url=http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200901121515-34705.html | script-title=zh:\u300a\u5c0f\u5a18\u60f9\u300b\u91cd\u9022\u7248\u88ab\u8f70\u662f\u5783\u573e | publisher=Lianhe Wanbao | date=12 January 2009 | accessdate=2009-01-12 | last=Zhong | first=Yanling | language=Chinese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119094047/http://www.omy.sg/Showbiz/E-News/Story/OMYStory200901121515-34705.html | archive-date=2009-01-19 | url-status=live }}</ref> In response, MediaCorp said that this was not an \"alternate ending\", as some have suggested.

It was notably parodied in the variety show, ''[[Black Rose (Singaporean TV series)|Black Rose]]''. In the episode when the encore started its debut, [[Chen Hanwei]] played Liu Yidao (\u7559\u4e00\u5200) and [[Dennis Chew]] portrayed Yamamoto Yue Niang (\u5c71\u672c\u6708\u5a18). It was also used in the skit segment of [[Star Search 2010]] Grand Finals in which contestants played Liu Yidao, Yuzhu, Ah Tao and Robert Zhang.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Lianhe Wanbao]]'', the series' scriptwriter, Ang Eng Tee, said that if the demand exists, he will write a special presentation, or even a sequel to the series. Ideas for a possible sequel or special presentation have already been drafted by Ang, one of which would have Angela receiving a secret wooden box from Ah Tao, before Angela returns to Singapore. The box was owned by Yueniang, and Ah Tao defied her orders to burn the contents before Yueniang died. The box contained details on Yueniang and Chen Xi's relationship, in addition to a letter from Libby, telling Yueniang that Chen Xi and Libby did not get married after all.<ref name=\"ending2\"/> However, it was noted that production sequels have been much frowned upon by producers, and owing to the high production costs, a sequel seems to be very unlikely, but another drama in 2010 [[Unriddle]] is having a sequel to the original in 2012.\n\n===''The Peranakan Ball''===\nOn May 16, 2009, Jeanette Aw and Dai Yangtian starred in a musical called The Peranakan Ball ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: \u5a18\u60f9\u4e4b\u604b). The musical is based on the story of Cinderella and it stars Jeanette Aw as Bee Tin, a Nyonya servant in a wealthy Peranakan household, and unrelated to the television series, even though the concept was clearly derived from the drama.<ref name=\"musical\">{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/426296/1/.html|title=\"\"The Peranakan Ball\" musical set for May 16|last=CNA|first=CNA|date=1 May 2009|publisher=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=2009-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502192407/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/426296/1/.html|archive-date=2009-05-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===''Pretty Maid''===\nWhile not promoted as such, and the program was produced by a different television station, many Singaporeans who watched the series ''{{Interlanguage link|Pretty Maid|lt=|zh|\u5927\u4e2b\u9b1f|WD=}}'' believe it copies the main plot of The Little Nyonya.
