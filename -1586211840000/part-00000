These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, rubber stamps, etc., most of which were decorated with [[Motif (textile arts)|motifs]] from [[graphic arts]].<ref>Yona Fischer, ''Art and Artisan in the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1979, Israel Museum) (in Hebrew).</ref> In the Jewish settlements artists worked at [[gold smithing]], silver smithing, and embroidery, producing their works in small crafts workshops. A portion of these works were intended to be amulets. One of the best known of these artists, [[Moshe Ben Yitzhak Mizrachi]] of Jerusalem made Shiviti (or Shivisi, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, meditative plaques used in some Jewish communities for contemplation over God's name) on glass and amulets on parchments, with motifs such as the Sacrifice of Isaac, the [[Book of Esther]], and views of the [[Temple Mount]] and the [[Western Wall]].<ref>Haviva Peled, \"Seven Artists\", in Fischer (1979).</ref> Objects of applied art were produced also at the \"[[Torah ve-Melakhah]]\" (\"Torah and Work\") school founded in 1882 by the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]].<ref>Gideon Ofrat, \"First Starts: Torah and Work\", in [http://www.openu.ac.il/zmanim/zmanim103/download/zmanim103-ofrat.pdf ''Zmanim''], 103, Summer 2008 (in Hebrew)</ref> This school opened departments for the production of art objects in [[Neoclassicism|Neo-Classical]] and [[Baroque]] styles, produced by combining manual labor with modern machines.\n\nA large body of artistic work was produced by European artists, primarily Christian painters, who came to document the sites and landscapes of the \"[[Holy Land]]\". The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation \u2013 first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] \u2013 of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.<ref>Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)</ref> Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.<ref>P.A.

Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the \u201cBezalel School of Arts and Crafts,\u201d known as \"[[Bezalel]]\", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.\n\nAt the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British \"[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]\" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine \"''Yalkut Bezalel''\", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption \"Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction\".<ref>Yael Granot, \"Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community\" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)</ref>\n\nAlongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. \"There is a practical side to the study of art\", Schatz wrote, \"The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit\".<ref>Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129</ref>\n\nIn the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the \"Eastern\" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as \"Jewish\" motifs and designs they perceived as \"Eastern\". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.<ref>Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)</ref>\n\nThe work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865\u20131908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as \"[[Jugendstil]]\" [\"Youth Style\" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were \"Orientalist\" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lakhovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.\n\nDue to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.\n\n===Land of Israel modernism movement===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d1\u05ea\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]<br />The Roaring Lion, 1928\u20131934<br />[[Tel Hai]]]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more \"subjective\" art. this Period often called The \"[[Tower of David Period]]\". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''</ref> Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.\n\nThe monument \"The Roaring Lion\" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the \"Assyrian-Mesopotamian\" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. \"For many generations\", Melnikov asserted, \"the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it\".<ref>''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925</ref>\n\nOther young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the \"Hebrew Artists Association\" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an \"Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists\" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the \"Bezalel Art\" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.\n\nAnother organization of Israel artists was called \"Egged\" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh Lubin|Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called \"The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930\".\n\nTo a significant extent the modern painters began to create a \"Hebrew\" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward na\u00efve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the \"Land of Israel School\".\n\nAmong the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting \"Resting at Noon\" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this na\u00efve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.\n\nThis approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the \"Railway Crossing at Herzl Street\" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.\n\nReuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in \"Sophie, Bukharin Jewess\" (1924) and \"Dancers from Miron\" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In \"First Fruits\" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in \"First Fruits\" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.\n\nIn spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.\n\n===Armenian ceramic art===\n[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.\n\nThe central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884\u20131953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].<ref>Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52</ref> As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts\u2014frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.\n\nThe artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.<ref>Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53\u201391.</ref> Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.\n\n==Between East and West: The 1930s and 1940s==\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|[[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Aharon Meskin]]\n[[File:Larski Human hand's 001.jpg|thumb|[[Helmar Lerski]], Human hands, 1933\u20131940]]\n\nThe return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.<ref>For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).</ref> Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the \"Parisian\" influence was expressed in a \"dynamic softness that melts heavy structures\", German art and the \"[[New Objectivity]]\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.<ref>Gideon Efrat, \"Anorexia Artistica\" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.</ref>\n\nThe most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the \"[[Bauhaus]]\". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.\n\nOne sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the \"New Bezalel\". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, \"Bezalel\", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].<ref>Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).</ref> Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, \"The Fleece\" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.\n\nEven more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as [[Zoltan Kluger]], [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.\n\n[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called \"metamorphosis by means of light\"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.\nAnother artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.<ref>Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.<ref>Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.</ref>\n\n===Canaanite movement===\n{{Main|Canaanism}}\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]<br />Nimrod, 1939<br />The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|[[Amos Kenan]]<br />Messiah, 1966<br />Tefen Open Museum]]\n\nIn 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908\u20131981) published \"Epistle to Hebrew Youth\", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of \"[[Canaanism|The Canaanites]]\", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew\u2013speaking nation with an independent identity.\n\nThe visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.\n\nOne of the most significant artists of the \"Canaanite\" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was \"to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us\".<ref>Amos Kenan, \"Greater Israel\", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).</ref> In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.\n\nDanziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.<ref>Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).</ref>  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures \"[[Nimrod]]\" (1939) and \"[[Shabazia]]\" (1939). When \"Nimrod\" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of \"Jewishness\". To a significant extent \"Nimrod\" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the \"New Jewish Man\".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation\u2026Nimrod will be young forever\".<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the \"Canaanite\" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in \"primitive\" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the \"New Horizons\" group.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \"The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'\", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n== The Artists' Quarter of Tzfat ==\nDuring the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s [[Safed|Tzfat]] served as a beacon of inspiration for Israeli artists. Dozens of different artists including [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]], [[Moshe Castel]], Rosentalis, Shimshon Holzman and others made their home in Tzfat (many of the artists used to spend the summer in the cooler Tzfat and the winter in warmer [[Tel Aviv]], others such as [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]] would commute between France and Tzfat/Tel Aviv).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war of Independence (1948), the Arab quarter was vacated and Tzfat decided to grant homes to Israel's great artists. This led to a golden age of art in Tzfat that would decay from the 1970s onwards.<ref>{{Citation|title=Safed|date=2019-08-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safed&oldid=909927476|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFrenkel Frenel, [[Rolly Sheffer]] and other artists were heavily inspired by the stunning panoramas and views that Tzfat offered them of [[Mount Meron|Mt Meron]], something that is very visible in their work. Tzfat, one of the four holy cities of Judaism provided a powerful emotional scenery to those artists who visited.

Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===New Horizons===\n[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]<br />Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961 70x50 cm]]\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]<br />Growth, 1959<br />Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]\n\nThe germination of the \"New Horizons\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name \"the Group of Eight\", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called \"The Group of Seven\" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].<ref>Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).</ref> Members of the group stated that \"The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality\".<ref>''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.</ref>\n\nFor these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the \"New Horizons\". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.\n\nThe group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group \u2013 Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called \"lyrical abstract\", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the \"Land of Israel\" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.\n\nFor example, in his series \"Yehiam\" (1949\u20131952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.<ref>Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.</ref>\n\nZvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.\n\nOthers in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.\n\nIn the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.\n\nIndeed, during the 1950s, the \"New Horizons\" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.<ref>See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Realism and Social art===\nWhile the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as \"regionalism\".<ref>Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).</ref> New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, \"Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul\".<ref>Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).</ref> Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period \u2013 World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nThe quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nNew Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim \u2013 his series \"Yehiam\", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950\u20131952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced \"Wheat Sheaves\" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted \"Soldiers\", \"Air raid Alarms\" and \"Maabarot\" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the \"Center for Advanced Culture\" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement \"[[Hashomer Hatzair]]\".<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.</ref> This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.\n\nMordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting \"Gate of Light\" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.\n\nEver since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].\n\n===Abstract art after New Horizons===\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[Ofakim Hadashim]] (New Horizons) influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.\n\nNew Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called \"Tazpit\" (\"Outlook\"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&nbsp;cm 1971]]\nOne of the artists on the fringe of the \"New Horizons\" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, \"Red House (How Are Things at Home?)\" (1960),<ref>For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, \"The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'\", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).</ref> \"Sarajevo Manuscript\" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works \"The High Commissioner\" (1966) and \"Agripas Street\" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.<ref>Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, \"The High Commissioner\", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).</ref> These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the \"Caananite\" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the \"New Horizons\" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.\nAbstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.<ref>Exceptions to this are the works \"With beers, beers, and more beers\" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works \"Fraction and Time\", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.</ref> Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues \"life experience as the layers accumulate\".<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy\" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963\u20131984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n==Local Art Between Wars, 1967\u20131982==\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]<br />''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]\n\nUntil the 1970s, mainstream Israeli art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the \"ars poetica\" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.\n\n===Art of Protest===\nAmong the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].<ref>Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, \"Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin\", in Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).</ref> His early works, such as \"Panic Over Trousers\" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.</ref> This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Earth Art]]\", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).</ref> Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.\n\n===\"Want of Matter\"===\n[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]<br />Untitled, 1969<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]<br />Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978<br />[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s a group called \"[[10+]]\" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the \"lyric abstraction\" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschitz]], and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although \"10+\" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school \"The College\" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called \"The Want of Matter\".\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit \"The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art\", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the \"non-aesthetic\" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.\n\nAccording to Breitberg-Semel, \"The Want of Matter\" began with the painting of the \"[[New Horizons]]\" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the \"lyrical abstract\", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called \"The Want of Matter\", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.\n\nVisually, \"[[Want of Matter]]\" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.\n\nIn an article accompanying \"The Want of Matter\" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work \"typifies the Tel Aviv spirit\", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally \"native\" and \"Sabra\" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.<ref>Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: \"The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'\"; See: Doron Rabina, \"The Drawing Itself\". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.</ref> Lavie's paintings, which include \"childish\" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words \"head\" or \"geranium\" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,<ref>This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.</ref> came to epitomize \"The Want of Matter\" style.\n\nIn addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its \"artistic language\" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the \"halo\" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.<ref>See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.</ref> Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and \"content\".<ref>Michal Neeman, \"Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here\", 2, 1999, p. 104.</ref>\n\n[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in \"The College\". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as \"The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly\" (1979) and \"The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times\" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation \" If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden\" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a \"toy forest\".<ref>See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.<ref>Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).</ref> Against the background of the visual dimension of \"The Want of Matter\" Style, texts written in commercial style<ref>Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.</ref> or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in \"The Loyal Fish and the Bird\" (1977) or \"The Message According to the Bird\" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series \"The Blue Retouching\" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.\n\nIn spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as \"Bicycle\" (1977) or \"The Princess in the Palace\" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work \"bursts out \" of its frame and spreads out into space.\n\n===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===\n[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]<br />''Energy'', 1969<br />[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n\nConceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yocheved Weinfeld]], [[Adina Bar-On]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading \u2018taste\u2019 while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)\n\nThe axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva\u2019s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.\n\nUllman\u2019s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration \u2013five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.\n\n[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]\nJoshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.\n\nEfrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.\n\nEfrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art \"epistemic abstraction\". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal\u2014the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric\u2014that is, obedient and \u201cblind\u201d\u2014reproductive mechanism.\n\nThese dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 \"Art and Language\", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum \"Eyes of the Nation\" by Ellen Ginton 2008.\n\n[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]<br />Levitation, 1976]]\nThe perception of \"The Want of Matter\" as the \"center\" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the \"Tel Aviv School\", \"The New Jerusalem School\", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the \"Tel Aviv School\", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the \"Jerusalem\" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.<ref>Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).</ref> A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed \"conceptuality\" to \"picturesqueness\", universal abstraction to specific locality.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nAnother trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like \"activity\" and \"concept\", instead of terms like \"installation\" and \"display\", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.<ref>See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).</ref> At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or \"concrete, \" that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.<ref>See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref> Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.\n\nEllen Ginton, in her article \"The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries \" (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).</ref> Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.<ref>Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===\"Place\", \"Concept\" and \"Action\"===\n[[File:NeusteinJerusalemRiverProject.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Neustein]], [[Gerard Marx]], [[Georgette Batlle]], \"Jerusalem River Project\", 1970]]\n[[File:Beersheba, Monument to Negev Brigade, Bunker 02.jpg|thumb|[[Dani Karavan]]<br /> Monument to the Negev Brigade, 1963\u20131968<br />[[Beersheba]]]]\n[[File:Danziger Akalton 002.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Danziger]]<br />Serpentine, 1975<br />The Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n[[File:Ullman, micha way b85 0629.jpg|thumb|[[Micha Ullman]]<br />Passage, 1982<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:AvitalGevaGreenhouse.jpg|thumb|Avital Geva, \"Greenhouse\", Ein-Shemer Kibbutz, Israel]]\n\nOne of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create \"The Jerusalem River Project\". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26\u201332. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThis work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward \"[[Land Art]]\". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the \"Land of Israel\" and the \"Orient\", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the \"New Horizons\" school can be clearly seen.\n\nIn the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of \"Land Art\" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state\", Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept\".<ref>In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nAnother example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, \"bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches [\u2026] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish\"<ref>Amnon Barzel, \"Landscape As a Work of Art\" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88\u201389. (In Hebrew).</ref> Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks\", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\"<ref>See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82\u201383. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).</ref> for these lands.\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians\", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words \"America\", \"Africa\", and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240.

(In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===Identity and the Body===\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]\n\nThe landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).</ref> In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work \"Letter to Beuys\" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.\n\nIn his work \"Via Dolorosa\" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, ''\"The Heart of Things\", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971\u20131986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\n===Political art===\nAfter the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.\n\nOne of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work \"Touching the Border\" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland\".<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (\"Gabi and Sharon\") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, \"Who needs a parade?\" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.\n\n[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture\", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T\", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision\".<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, \"Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?\" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>Irit Segoli, \"My Red is Your Precious Blood\", Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[File:NeusteinStillLifeOnTheBorder.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, \"Still Life On The Border\", Tel-Hai, Israel, 1983]]\nJoshua Neustein\u2019s Still Life 1983 was a shape of a Phantom Jet made of burning car tires on the Lebanon Border.\n\n===The 1980s in Israeli Art===\n[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemm\u00e1in, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br />Jemm\u00e1in, 1986<br />Kunsthalle, Manheim]]\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman cart 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Cart, 1984]]\n[[File:Larry Abramson, tsoba, 1993-1994.jpg|thumb|[[Larry Abramson]]<br />from tsoba, 1993-4<br />impression on newspaper no.XIV<br />private collection]]\n\nMost of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American \"[[Neo-Geo]]\" style, the \"Pop Art\" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as \"[[Bad Painting]]\", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.\n\nThese international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of \"the high\" and \"the low\" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.<ref>See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.\n\nIn parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.\n\nIf in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with \"protest\". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as \"Green Line With Green Eyes\" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-na\u00efve style, combined with captions like \"Here is Arara\" or \"Umm Al-Fahm\".\n\n[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled \"Tsoba\". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], in which he \"erased\", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.\n\nArtistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.\n\nIn the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.\n\n[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named \"Shelter 209\", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the \"[[Zik Group]]\", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.\n\n===The 1990s and After===\n[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]<br />Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br />The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002<br />(from \"The Country\")]]\n\nThe 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the \"[[Art Focus]]\" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).\n\nAs part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.\n\nIn the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.\n\nIn works such as \"Temple Mount\" (1995) or \"Country\" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined \"primitive\" images with modernist values. In his work \"The Clinic\" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work \"The Boy From South Tel Aviv\" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition \"Real Time\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEven the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition \"Yotam\" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.\n\nIn the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as \"Keffiyah\" and \"Biladi\", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.\n\nThe tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the \"Sabra\" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series \"Jericho First\" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.\n\nThe photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death.

The motive behind these works was [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] and religious and focused on documentation \u2013 first of the [[painting]] and later of the [[photography]] \u2013 of the holy sites and the way of life in the [[Orient]], and on the presentation of exotic people.<ref>Yehoshua Ben Arie, ''Artists and art of the Land of Israel in the 19th Century'' (1992, Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi)</ref> Photographs of the Holy Land, which also served as the basis for paintings, focused on documenting structures and people in full daylight, due to the limitations of photography at that time.<ref>P.A.

Artists and craftsmen of Judaica objects and other applied arts made up the majority of artists working in the Land of Israel. Although the \u201cBezalel School of Arts and Crafts,\u201d known as \"[[Bezalel]]\", was not the first art school established in the Jewish settlement, its importance in setting the boundaries of the tradition of [[modern art]] in the Land of Israel was very great indeed, and it is customary to view its establishment as the beginning of Israeli art. The school was founded in 1906 by [[Boris Schatz]] with the support of heads of Jewish and [[Zionist]] institutions. At Bezalel emphasis was placed on objects of [[applied art]] with a metaphysical dimension.\n\nAt the art school the influence of European [[Art Nouveau]] was in evidence, in addition to other social movements such as the British \"[[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]]\" movement. In the logo of the quarterly magazine \"''Yalkut Bezalel''\", designed by [[Ze'ev Raban]], we see within the ornate frame [[cherub]]s with a painter and a sculptor on each side and a lamp maker and a rug weaver next to them. Under the illustration is the caption \"Work is the fruit; art is the bud; art without a soul is like prayer without conviction\".<ref>Yael Granot, \"Bezalel and the Ben Shemen Jewelers' Community\" in Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Art and Artisans, Roots and Boundaries'' (2003, Tel Aviv Faculty of the Arts)</ref>\n\nAlongside the art school, within its different tracks, studios opened for the production of [[jewelry]], tapestries, paintings and Jewish ceremonial objects that were sold in Jerusalem shops.  Schatz's vision included the idea of cross pollination between the various parts of the institution. \"There is a practical side to the study of art\", Schatz wrote, \"The school always needs new drawings for the rugs and silver artifacts. Thus we need a series of artists who have absorbed the prevailing spirit of the school within their art, having studied with the expert teacher who embodies this spirit\".<ref>Granot in Canaan-Kedar (2003), p.129</ref>\n\nIn the art created in Bezalel during this period Jewish and religious motifs dominate, for example, descriptions of the holy places, scenes from the Diaspora, etc. The works are decorative and heavily engraved in the \"Eastern\" style. The descriptions sought a connection between the Biblical period, the Return to Zion [from the Babylonian exile] and the Hasmonean Kingdom of Israel [140-37 BC], and the Zionist aspirations for the development of a Jewish settlement, driven by ideological and Zionist sentiments. The artists did this by borrowing historical motifs they perceived as \"Jewish\" motifs and designs they perceived as \"Eastern\". Typography occupied a central place in their designs. Sometimes the text even became the main element in their compositions.<ref>Chaya Benjamin, ''Bezalel of Jerusalem: From the Allen B. Slipka Collection of the Israel Museum'' (2008, Israel Museum, Jerusalem)</ref>\n\nThe work of Schatz himself consisted mostly of small-scale sculptures of Jewish subjects, as well as reliefs and memorial plaques in honor of various Zionist leaders. His most famous sculpture is Mattathias (1894), which was influenced by [[Renaissance]] sculpture and in particular by the sculpture of [[Donatello]]. A different spirit entirely brought [[Samuel Hirszenberg]] (1865\u20131908), to the institution to join the Bezalel teaching staff. Hirszenberg brought European academic painting to Bezalel, and painted Jewish subjects within this framework. The artist Ze'ev Raban created many graphic works in the spirit of Art Nouveau, also known as \"[[Jugendstil]]\" [\"Youth Style\" in [[German language|German]]]. The subjects of these works were \"Orientalist\" landscapes of the Holy Land and figures from the Bible drawn in the Neoclassical style. Among other well-known artists who taught at Bezalel were [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]], [[Meir Gur-Arieh]], [[Arnold Lakhovsky|Arnold (Aaron) Lachovsky]], [[Erich Goldberg|Erich (Arie) Goldberg]], [[Adolph (Avraham) Berman]], [[Shmuel Levi]] (Ophel), and others.\n\nDue to financial difficulties and political infighting the school closed in 1929. The museum, which housed many works of art, remained in the Bezalel building. This collection eventually served as the basis for the Art Wing of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem.\n\n===Land of Israel modernism movement===\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 224 Tel Hai Lion Sculpture \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d2 \u05d1\u05ea\u05dc \u05d7\u05d9.JPG|thumb|[[Avraham Melnikov]]<br />The Roaring Lion, 1928\u20131934<br />[[Tel Hai]]]]\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century some of the Bezalel students began to rebel against the rigid artistic tradition that was followed in the institution and turned to more \"subjective\" art. this Period often called The \"[[Tower of David Period]]\". One of the most prominent of these artists was the sculptor [[Avraham Melnikov]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/of-stone-and-schizophrenia-1.360707 Of stone and schizophrenia], ''[[Haaretz]]''</ref> Melnikov suggested a different formal approach, culled from within the art of the Ancient East. This approach was offered as a replacement for the European art forms that dominated Bezalel during the reign of Schatz and Lilien.\n\nThe monument \"The Roaring Lion\" which Melnikov erected at [[Tel Hai]], designed in the \"Assyrian-Mesopotamian\" style, reflected Melnikov's aesthetic ideal. \"For many generations\", Melnikov asserted, \"the Jews were cut off from the figurative tradition in art; there are many ways to express artistic taste, but the taste that was in fashion was European art based on Greek and Roman culture, and as long as Athens was the inspiration for art in Europe, the Jew was instinctively excluded from it\".<ref>''Haaretz'', 18 December 1925</ref>\n\nOther young artists offered alternative artistic approaches, turning to modern art, of which Schatz and Melnikov strongly disapproved. This showed up also in the exhibitions they organized. In 1920, for example, the \"Hebrew Artists Association\" was formed; it organized the annual exhibition, and during the years 1923 to 1928 held an \"Exhibition of Land of Israel Artists\" in the [[Tower of David]] in Jerusalem's Old City, organized by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], [[Shmuel Levi|Shmuel (Ophel) Levy]], Melnikov, and others. In these exhibitions art in the \"Bezalel Art\" style were exhibited next to art influenced by the European Post-Impressionist and Expressionist styles. Other exhibitions of Modern Art were held in the hut attached to the [[Ohel theater]] in Tel Aviv between 1926 and 1929.\n\nAnother organization of Israel artists was called \"Egged\" (The Amalgamation) and included artists such as [[Arieh Lubin|Arieh (Leo) Lubin]], [[Pinchas Litvinovsky]], [[Sionah Tagger]], [[Chana Orloff]], Yossef Zaritsky, [[Chaim Gliksberg]], [[Reuven Rubin]], [[Arieh Allweil]], and [[Nachum Gutman]]. Some of its members, like Orloff and Tagger, displayed influences from French [[Cubism]] in their works. The group held an exhibition in 1929 in an apartment on [[Allenby Street]] in Tel Aviv, opposite the [[Mograbi Theater]]. Another exhibition of modern art was held in 1930 in the Tel Aviv Museum and was called \"The Beginnings of Modernism in Israeli Painting, 1920-1930\".\n\nTo a significant extent the modern painters began to create a \"Hebrew\" version of [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] painting using a palette of light colors, an attraction to expressive brushstrokes, and a tendency toward na\u00efve, flat painting. In addition to traditional subjects such as portraits, many artists depicted the Land of Israel in landscapes that added a romantic perspective to their subjects. This style of these works is sometimes called the \"Land of Israel School\".\n\nAmong the artists identified with this style, the artist Nachum Gutman stands out. Gutman painted many depictions of the city of Tel Aviv, but also of the Land of Israel's Arab citizens, many of whom he met with in Jaffa. His famous painting \"Resting at Noon\" (1926) depicts Fellahin (Arab farmers) resting in the field from their day's labor. An examination of Gutman's style in these years shows a tendency toward the simplification of forms, in the tradition of expressive painting, and toward the use of strong colors. Some critics feel that this na\u00efve style of painting reveals Gutman's romantic approach towards the landscapes of the Land of Israel and its Arab inhabitants.\n\nThis approach is also typical of other artists of this period. Sionah Tagger, for example, created a description of the \"Railway Crossing at Herzl Street\" (1920) in an expressive style that emphasized the modernity of the new Hebrew city. [[Israel Paldi]] (Feldman) depicted scenes of the half-empty country in a palette of bright shades and colors. Another artist, [[Abel Pann]], expressed this romantic approach by focusing on subjects from the Bible depicted in illustrations that were fantastic in style.\n\nReuven Rubin also frequently depicted the Jewish existence in the Land of Israel. For example in \"Sophie, Bukharin Jewess\" (1924) and \"Dancers from Miron\" (1926) his tendency towards flatness and a decorative style stand out, showing the influence of modern art and even of [[Art Nouveau]]. In \"First Fruits\" (1923) Rubin presents figures typical of the 1920s, interwoven with a powerful and fantastic element. As in other works of his from this period, in \"First Fruits\" he shows a worldview that combines Zionism and Orientalism in one basket; thus, he depicts Jews and Arabs, pioneer couples and immigrants from Yemen and Bedouin shepherds in their native dress holding round fruit: a pomegranate, oranges, a watermelon, and bunch of bananas. And next to them local animals: goats and a camel.\n\nIn spite of his distance from the center of artistic activity in the Land of Israel, the works of [[Hermann Struck]], who immigrated to Israel in 1922, when he was already a mature artist with a worldwide reputation, also display some of the iconographic characteristics of visual art in the young Land of Israel. Palm trees and empty landscapes are central themes of his work. Along with paintings of the city of Jerusalem and its residents the special Land of Israel light, which so preoccupied its young artists, is translated in his prints into a sharp contrast which emphasizes the dark images on the light background.\n\n===Armenian ceramic art===\n[[File:Rockefeller Museum fountain2.jpg|thumb|[[Rockefeller Museum]]]]\n\nIn 1919 the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government extended an invitation to a group of [[Armenians|Armenian]] artists, survivors of the Armenian genocide, to renovate the tiles of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. This experiment reflected the British interest in traditional art in the spirit of the [[Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts]] Movement. Armenian [[ceramic art]] began in the 15th century in the Turkish cities of [[Iznik]] and [[Kutahya]], but the encounter with ancient Land of Israel art and with Christian motifs gave rise to a unique artistic synthesis.\n\nThe central artist during these first years was [[David Ohannessian]] (1884\u20131953), who specialized in decorative ceramics for structures and monuments, many of them at the invitation of the British government. Among the principal works Ohannessian created in Jerusalem were: tiles for the [[American Colony Hotel]] (1923), the fountain base for [[Saint John Eye Hospital Group]], the domed entry of the [[Rockefeller Museum]], etc. Among the motifs appearing in his decorations are cypress trees, tulips, and grapevines, all of which are typical of traditional [[Ottoman art]].<ref>Nurit Canaan-Kedar, ''Armenian Ceramics in Jerusalem'' (Yad Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem, 2002), pp.29-52</ref> As he transplanted his art to Jerusalem and continued to develop it, he added images inspired by the local traditions and Armenian illuminated manuscripts\u2014frequently using the Bird Mosaic in objects and tile panels.\n\nThe artists [[Megherdich Karakashian]] and [[Neshan Balian]], who in 1922 left Ohannessian's studio and founded a joint workshop, developed an independent style in which figurative images foreign to traditional Turkish art appeared. For example the two of them used imagery from ancient mosaics found in the Land of Israel, such as the Bird Mosaic from a 6th-century Armenian chapel or the mosaic from [[Hisham's Palace]]. Often these images were imbued with a Christian theological interpretation.<ref>Kenaan-Kedar (2002), pp.53\u201391.</ref> Their joint workshop remained active until 1964, when [[Stepan Karakashian]] and [[Marie Balian]], the heirs of the founding artists, set up two independent workshops that both used designs that had been developed in the past and created some new ones of their own.\n\n==Between East and West: The 1930s and 1940s==\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|[[Zeev Ben Zvi]], Aharon Meskin]]\n[[File:Larski Human hand's 001.jpg|thumb|[[Helmar Lerski]], Human hands, 1933\u20131940]]\n\nThe return of Jewish artists from Europe in the 1930s to Mandatory Palestine gave rise to a variety of influences from modern art on art in the Land of Israel. At the same time these influences did not motivate the artists toward [[Avant garde]] and abstract art in their painting and sculpture.<ref>For a distinction between avant garde in an artistic and in a political sense, see Peter Berger, '''Theory of the Avant Garde''' (Rasling, Tel Aviv).</ref> Two of the strongest influences were French art and German art. Gideon Efrat claimed that these influences created two different trends in the plastic arts. While the \"Parisian\" influence was expressed in a \"dynamic softness that melts heavy structures\", German art and the \"[[New Objectivity]]\" (Neue Sachlichkeit) which brought with it a static and sculptured monumentality.<ref>Gideon Efrat, \"Anorexia Artistica\" in ''Washington Crosses the Jordan'' (Sifria Zionit, Jerusalem, 2008), p.67.</ref>\n\nThe most typical influence of the European avant garde is evident in international architectural styles in the Land of Israel, brought by architects who were graduates of the \"[[Bauhaus]]\". The considerable influence of [[French realism]] can also be found in the works of a group of artists who were influenced by the trend towards realism of French sculptors of the beginning of the 20th century, such as [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], and others. This symbolic message in content and form appears also in the works of artists of the Land of Israel group, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Rafael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied at some point in France.\n\nOne sculptor who was influenced by Cubism was [[Zeev Ben Zvi]] who, in 1928, after completing his studies at Bezalel, went to study in France. Upon his return he served for a short period as a teacher of sculptor at Bezalel, and at the \"New Bezalel\". In 1932 Ben Zvi had his first exhibit at the national antiquities museum, \"Bezalel\", and a year later he had an exhibit at the [[Tel Aviv Museum]].<ref>Haim Gimzu, ''Ben-Zvi the Sculptor'' (Hazvi, Tel Aviv, 1955).</ref> Instead of making use of [[Cubism]] as a means of subverting the artistic object, Ben Zvi's sculptures use Cubism as a means of intensifying the feeling of monumentality of the image. In the work of artists such as [[Chana Orloff]] and [[Shalom Sebba]] as well, the Cubist language in which they shaped their works did not lead them to abandon the realism and the boundaries of traditional representation. In his well-known work, \"The Fleece\" (1947), for example, Sebba used the Cubist language to intensify the monumentality of his images, while using angles of observation inspired by photography.\n\nEven more striking avant garde trends began to appear in the work of the Jewish photographers, most of whom were influenced by the German avant garde and the expressionists of the 1920s and 1930s. Photography in the land of Israel developed under the encouragement and guidance of the Zionist establishment, under the auspices of groups such as the Jewish National Fund, which commissioned photographs that would spread the Zionist message. Artists such as [[Zoltan Kluger]], [[Yaakov Rosner|Yaakov (Jack) Rosner]], and others, documented the Zionist enterprise and the Jewish settlement, sometimes using photographic angles, compositions, and views which took their inspiration from Soviet Communism in Russia. Other photographers sought to use these techniques for artistic or commercial photography.\n\n[[Helmar Lerski]] created photographic portraits in typical expressionist style, expressed in his use of light and in the angle of the photograph. In 1936 Larski created 175 photographs of man, which attempted to encompass his personality in its entirety, using a technique called \"metamorphosis by means of light\"; this technique made use of mirrors, and he even taught it in workshops on the roof of his home in Tel Aviv.\nAnother artist, [[Alfons Himmelreich]], created advertising photographs which emphasized industrial commercialism by using a distortion of the usual standards, close ups, and light for emphasis, as a designer of commercialism. Among the photographers who worked in a more artistic tradition were Richard Levy (Ereel), who created photomontages of semi-abstract figures; [[Tim (Nahum) Gidal]], and the sisters [[Charlotte Meyer|Charlotte]] and [[Gerda Meyer]], who specialized in architectural photography.<ref>Rona Sela (editor), ''Photography in the Land of Israel in the 1930s and 1940s'' (Kibbutz Hameuchad, 2000).</ref>\n\nThe intensification of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute influenced the works of Arab photographers with a developed political consciousness, such as [[Ali Zaarur]], [[Chalil Rissas]], and others. They acted on their own or as agents of various information agencies, and created photographs in journalistic style. Only from the 1990s did researchers begin to investigate these works as part of historiography, and as the visual representation of the past, with political, ideological, and nationalistic goals in mind.<ref>Sela (2000), pp. 40-67.</ref>\n\n===Canaanite movement===\n{{Main|Canaanism}}\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|[[Itzhak Danziger]]<br />Nimrod, 1939<br />The [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem Collection]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|[[Amos Kenan]]<br />Messiah, 1966<br />Tefen Open Museum]]\n\nIn 1943 the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] (1908\u20131981) published \"Epistle to Hebrew Youth\", the proclamation, the manifesto, the first written communication of \"[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]\", a literary and artistic movement that had been active for some time. In this essay Ratosh called on [[Hebrew]] speaking youth to become a buffer against [[Judaism]]. He declared that between the youth that had settled in the Land of Israel and the Jews of the Diaspora there was no true connection. This became the characteristic cry of the Caananites, whose members proposed a return to the mythological past, in order to create a Hebrew\u2013speaking nation with an independent identity.\n\nThe visual expression of this aspiration was the use of archaic forms and styles, under the influence of Fertile Crescent art. This tendency reflected, to a significant degree, the interest in primitive art and sculpture that was prevalent in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. Often this pro-Archaic style was an expression of symbolism.\n\nOne of the most significant artists of the \"Canaanite\" movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]]. He returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and demonstrated a new national outlook in his work which, in contrast to what was acceptable in Europe, was full of sensuality and Eastern exoticism. This art fit the feelings and sense of identity of much of the population of the Jewish settlement in the Land of Israel. The dream of Danziger's contemporaries, writes [[Amos Keinan]] after Danziger's death, was \"to unite with the land of Israel and the earth of which it is composed, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and to embed in history the mark of that something special that is us\".<ref>Amos Kenan, \"Greater Israel\", ''Yedioth Aharonot'', 19 August 1977 (in Hebrew).</ref> In addition to nationalism, his sculptures demonstrated an expressionist-symbolist style similar in spirit to British sculpture of the same period.\n\nDanziger opened a sculpture studio in the yard of his father's hospital in Tel Aviv, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yechiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], etc.<ref>Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishing, 1980), p. 134 (in Hebrew).</ref>  In addition to his students, his studio became a popular meeting place for artists from other fields as well. In this studio Danziger created his first significant works, the sculptures \"[[Nimrod]]\" (1939) and \"[[Shabazia]]\" (1939). When \"Nimrod\" was unveiled it became the focus of an important dispute in Land of Israel cultural circles; the sculpture depicts the figure of Nimrod, the Biblical hunter according to Jewish religious literature, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, a sword clutched in his hand and a falcon on his shoulder. The sculpture harked back to the earlier cultures of the Assyrians, the Egyptians, and the Greeks, while at the same time it showed similarities to the European sculpture of the time. The sculpture expressed a combination of homoerotic beauty and pagan idolatry. This combination was at the center of criticism in religious circles in the Jewish settlement. The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Canaanites was heard not only in religious circles, which objected to the pagan and idolatrous aspects of the work, but also in secular circles among those who objected to the rejection of \"Jewishness\". To a significant extent \"Nimrod\" intensified a dispute that had existed prior to its appearance. At the same time other voices called it the new model for the \"New Jewish Man\".  The newspaper Boker [Morning] wrote in 1942 that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture. It is flesh of our flesh, spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and it is a monument. It is the apotheosis of the vision and daring and youthful rebellion that distinguishes an entire generation\u2026Nimrod will be young forever\".<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, 1999 (in Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later had his reservations about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many artists adopted the \"Canaanite\" style and point of view in their sculpture. Figures resembling idols and images in \"primitive\" style appeared in Israeli art until the 1970s. Furthermore the influence of the Canaanite movement was evident in the art of the \"New Horizons\" group.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \"The Secret Caananite Character of 'New Horizons'\", Art Visits (2005) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n== The Artists' Quarter of Tzfat ==\nDuring the 1950s, the 1960s and the 1970s [[Safed|Tzfat]] served as a beacon of inspiration for Israeli artists. Dozens of different artists including [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]], [[Moshe Castel]], Rosentalis, Shimshon Holzman and others made their home in Tzfat (many of the artists used to spend the summer in the cooler Tzfat and the winter in warmer [[Tel Aviv]], others such as [[Yitzhak Frenkel|Yitzhak Frenkel Frenel]] would commute between France and Tzfat/Tel Aviv).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the war of Independence (1948), the Arab quarter was vacated and Tzfat decided to grant homes to Israel's great artists. This led to a golden age of art in Tzfat that would decay from the 1970s onwards.<ref>{{Citation|title=Safed|date=2019-08-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safed&oldid=909927476|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n\nFrenkel Frenel, [[Rolly Sheffer]] and other artists were heavily inspired by the stunning panoramas and views that Tzfat offered them of [[Mount Meron|Mt Meron]], something that is very visible in their work. Tzfat, one of the four holy cities of Judaism provided a powerful emotional scenery to those artists who visited. Frenkel Frenel and others who were influenced by the [[School of Paris|Ecole de Paris]] showcased the mystics of Tzfat with the avant garde movements they partained to. Frenkel Frenel who established the first school of art in Tel Aviv dreamed of the city and was amongst the first artists to settle in the ancient city. Marc Chagall would walk the streets and paint portraits of religious children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.frenkel-frenel.org/The_official_Isaac_Frenkel-Frenel_web_site/Welcome.html|title=FRENKEL FRENEL MUSEUM|website=www.frenkel-frenel.org|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>                                                                                                              \n\nDespite the constant decay there remains in Tzfat some galleries that guard the old heritage of art in Safed such as the [[Beit Castel]] gallery, [[Frenkel Frenel Museum]] and others...<ref>{{Citation|title=Beit Castel|date=2019-08-12|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Beit_Castel&oldid=910461355|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Yitzhak Frenkel|date=2019-08-09|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yitzhak_Frenkel&oldid=910131806|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>\n\n<br />                                                                                                               \n\n==Avant Garde: the 1950s and 1960s==\nIn the 1950s and 1960s Israeli artists began exploring the idiom of the Avant-garde current in Europe and the United States. Immigrant artists brought trends to Israel, and influential Israeli artists spent stints in Europe, especially in France. Some of these artists sought a universal style, while others sought to develop a uniquely Israeli avant-garde, in the spirit of nationalistic socialism and Zionism.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008) (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===New Horizons===\n[[File:Zaritsky, Yossef, Painting, 1950-1~B74 0036.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Zaritsky]]<br />Naan, The Painter and the Model, 1949<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich gouache 1961 70x50 cm]]\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|[[Dov Feigin]]<br />Growth, 1959<br />Ein Harod Mueeum of Art]]\n\nThe germination of the \"New Horizons\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") movement can be found in a group of artists who mounted an exhibition in Tel Aviv's Habima national theater in December 1942, under the name \"the Group of Eight\", But the group crystallized into the dominant artistic movement only after the founding of the state in 1948. Members of the school included [[Arie Aroch]], [[Zvi Meirowitch]], [[Avraham Naton]] (Natanson), [[Avigdor Stematsky]] and [[Yehezkel Streichman]]. The work of sculptor [[Dov Feigin]] also appeared in the catalog of the 1942 exhibition, though it was not displayed. In February 1947 five of the original members of the group joined [[Joseph Zaritsky]] for an exhibit called \"The Group of Seven\" at the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].<ref>Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'' (Reshefim Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 16-17 (in Hebrew).</ref> Members of the group stated that \"The group is based in modernism, especially French, yet seeks a unique style that expresses our own reality\".<ref>''Davar Ha-Shavua'', 12 February 1947.</ref>\n\nFor these artists, this was not only a statement of philosophy, but a practical work plan. Zaritsky, who served as chairman of the League of Painters and Sculptors in the Land of Israel, opposed the league's philosophy of equality among artists. In 1948, at the time of the opening of the artists' house that was to become the League's permanent home, he was delegated to select works for the Bienniale in Venice. His selections caused such an outrage among the members that he was ousted from his position. He walked out with a group of artists, and founded an alternative movement, the \"New Horizons\". On 9 November 1948, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art opened the first exhibit bearing the movement's name. Among the artists showing were Pinchas Abramovich, [[Marcel Janco]], [[Aharon Kahana]], [[Yohanan Simon]], [[Avshalom Okashi]] and [[Moshe Castel]], as well as movement founders Zaritsky, Streichman and Feigin.\n\nThe group sought a style that reflected the striving for Zionism and Modernism. This style was largely dictated by the leading artists of the group \u2013 Zaritsky, Stematsky Mairovich and Streichman. In practice, this style was a variant of European modernism. The style has been called \"lyrical abstract\", but in fact, there was little purely abstract art, but rather works rooted in the local visual landscape. This essentially figurative style was pushed toward the abstract by bold brush strokes, and a strong use of bright colors typical of the \"Land of Israel\" style, reflecting the strong Mediterranean light. Formats were generally rather small, and the style was similar to European abstract art before the second World War, akin to the art of Wassily Kandinsky, and unlike the abstract art prevalent in the United States at the time.\n\nFor example, in his series \"Yehiam\" (1949\u20131952), Zaritsky depicts scenes from the establishment of Kibbutz Yehiam in northern Israel. The early paintings in this series (mostly watercolors) depict the natural landscapes of the region, while the later paintings are (mostly oil) abstractions of these earlier scenes. This progression, contends art critic and curator Mordecai Omer, reflects Zaritsky's belief that external visual reality is the basis of artistic originality.<ref>Mordechai Omer, Zaritzky (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1984), p. 86.</ref>\n\nZvi Mairovich, a prominent members of Okakim Hadashim he painted in the abstract lyric style but unlike his colleagues Mairovich was more inclined to a German rather than a French pallette. Hs bold use of black and reds particularly in the gouaches. The big breakthrough was in oil pastels, that only he made in large format. Using a deep space photo surface rather than a flat paper was pioneering moment.\n\nOthers in the group, however, deviated from this style. Marcel Janco, of international fame for his involvement in the Dada movement in Europe in the 1930s, did not adopt this approach to abstraction; rather his art uses European Cubist and Expressionist styles to create a Jewish-Zionist narrative. Moshe Castel, also, went through a transformation during the 1950s from abstraction to expressionism characteristic of the Canaanist movement.\n\nIn the field of sculpture, the group introduced new media. [[Yechiel Shemi]], Dov Feigin, and, after a sojourn in Britain, [[Itzhak Danziger]], introduced welded steel as a new medium. This new form freed these artists from the figurative character of stone and wood carving, for a more purely abstract oeuvre. Here, too, however, there is frequent reference to the Canaanite figurativeness and symbolism.\n\nIndeed, during the 1950s, the \"New Horizons\" group tended more and more toward the abstract, and away from reliance on the figurative. Zaritsky led this shift, which was rooted in what he saw as a guiding ideology. Some members of the group, however, rejected this ideology, and eventually quit the movement. These included Janco, [[Alexander Bogen]], Aharon Kahana and Yehiel Simon.<ref>See: Gila Blass, ''New Horizons'', pp. 64\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Realism and Social art===\nWhile the abstract and secular works of the New Horizons group had profound influence on the course of art in Israel, they were nonetheless considered at the time to be on the fringes of mainstream art, which was mostly figurative and often bearing explicit Jewish and Zionist messages. This explicitly nationalist trend in Israeli art was denounced by its opponents as \"regionalism\".<ref>Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10 (In Hebrew).</ref> New Horizon critics, who maintained that art was international and universal, were opposed by the ideology of the Bezalel School at the time. [[Mordechai Ardon]], head of Bezalel, wrote in 1954, \"Every artist, like every citizen, must serve his country in heart and in soul\".<ref>Cited in: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), p. 21 (In Hebrew).</ref> Artists like [[Simon Zabar]], [[Moshe Gat]], and [[Ruth Schloss]] created works that reflected national social tensions, a clearly socialist political slant, and glorification of the worker. Others, like Naftali Bezem and Miron Sima, [[Moshe Bromberg]] (Bar-Am) depicted the dramatic events of the period \u2013 World War II and the Holocaust. Their works were explicitly Jewish, while adopting the styles of the European avant-garde of the early 20th century.\n\nThe quest for a connection between the artist and society is reflected also in the monumental works on the walls of public buildings that were commissioned beginning in the 1950s. Examples include the mosaics of Mordechai Gumpel on the walls of public buildings in Petach Tikva, Holon and elsewhere, that depict Jewish settlers building the nation, in a style drawing much on the Canaanists; or Yohanan Simon's mural of kibbutz youth at Kibbutz [[Gan Shmuel]], showing youth living the socialist dream.<ref>See: Galia Bar-Or, Gideon Efrat, ''The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity'' (Museum of Art Ein Harod, 2008), pp. 22-23 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nNew Horizons artists, too, despite their avowed adherence to a philosophy of universality, often expressed in their works sentiments of nationalism, Zionism, and socialism. For example, Zaritsky, one of the leading ideologues of the universalist school, produced series of paintings focusing on Israeli kibbutzim \u2013 his series \"Yehiam\", and a similar series on Naan (a kibbutz in central Israel), 1950\u20131952. Both these series include abstractions of the Israeli landscape. Zvi Mairovich one of the founders of New Horizons produced a series of large oil paintings called Mizpe Ramon focousing on the Israeli deseret. Sculptor Dov Feigin produced \"Wheat Sheaves\" in 1956, and Dadaist Janco painted \"Soldiers\", \"Air raid Alarms\" and \"Maabarot\" (jerry-built communities housing new Jewish immigrants in the 1950s). Some of the New Horizons artists belonged to the \"Center for Advanced Culture\" run by the Socialist-Zionist youth movement \"[[Hashomer Hatzair]]\".<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, p. 29.</ref> This activity culminated in the founding of the artists' village [[Ein Hod]] by a group of artists headed by Marcel Janco. There, Janco hoped to found a new socialist and artistic utopia.\n\nMordechai Ardon's work stands out from that of other New Horizons artists for dealing with the mystical and historical, rather than concentrating on the present. His canvases often depict episodes from Jewish history, from Biblical scenes to the Holocaust. For example, his painting \"Gate of Light\" (1953), shows the tree of life, a symbol of great Biblical and Kabbalistic meaning, within a surrealistic landscape reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee and others.\n\nEver since, surrealism has played a significant role in Israeli art, and some of its most gifted and influential proponents include artists like [[Zeev Kun]], [[Samuel Bak]], [[Baruch Elron]], Joel Tal-Mor, as well as [[Yosl Bergner]].\n\n===Abstract art after New Horizons===\nDuring the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the work of the [[Ofakim Hadashim]] (New Horizons) influenced new artistic trends in Israel. Some artists, like [[Yechiel Shemi]] and [[Aviva Uri]], continued the work of the group after it dissolved, mostly working in a non-objective abstract mode.\n\nNew Horizons' last exhibit was in 1963. A number of young artists joined the exhibit, including [[Raffi Lavie]], [[Moshe Kupferman]] and [[Igael Tumarkin]]. In 1964, a new group of about 30 artists formed, called \"Tazpit\" (\"Outlook\"), This group carried the torch of abstract art into the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See: Gila Blass, New Horizons, pp. 95-96.</ref>\n\n[[File:Zvi Mairovich Panda 1971.jpg|thumb|Zvi Mairovich Panda, oil pastel/paper 39 x 39&nbsp;cm 1971]]\nOne of the artists on the fringe of the \"New Horizons\" group who developed a new style was [[Arie Aroch]]. In contrast to the ideal of the rest of the group, Aroch's works showed, in addition to lyric abstraction, a tendency toward substantive content. For example, \"Red House (How Are Things at Home?)\" (1960),<ref>For an iconographic analysis of this painting, see: Gideon Efrat, \"The Aftermath of Arie Aroch's 'Red House'\", Studio: Journal of Art, 62, May 1995, p. 35 (In Hebrew).</ref> \"Sarajevo Manuscript\" (1966), and others hinted at content of Jewish historical significance along with the influence of the [[Pop Art]] of the time. In his works \"The High Commissioner\" (1966) and \"Agripas Street\" (1964), for instance, the many interpretations these works received included widespread perception of them as historical paintings in which Judaism and Jewish tradition are given a place of prominence.<ref>Cf, Sarit Shapiro, Paths of Wandering: Migrations, Journeys, and Transitions in Contemporary Israeli Art (The Israel Museum, 1991), p. 62; David Gintan, \"The High Commissioner\", Ha-Midrashah, 3, 2000, pp. 200-249 (In Hebrew).</ref> These paintings in particular, and Aroch's work in general, are generally viewed as the antithesis of the \"Caananite\" approach seen, for example, in Itzhak Danziger's early works.<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Agrippas vs. Nimrod\", Kav, 9, p. 99.</ref>\n\n[[Aviva Uri]] created expressive abstract drawings with motifs and images that called to mind birds, circus images, and landscapes. Another artist, Lea Nikel, painted highly colored abstracts in the style of French art of that period. [[Avigdor Arikha]] also painted in Israel during those years according to the principles outlined by the \"New Horizons\" group. Arikha painted large works in dark colors until he emigrated to Europe, where he began to produce small figurative paintings.\nAbstract art merged with conceptual art in Israel in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n[[Moshe Kupferman]], who had studied painting with [[Chaim Atar]] (Aptaker), Zaritsky,  [[Alexander Bogen]] and others developed an identifiable style characterized by reduced use of color, and by a process of erasing and wiping the drawing over and over until it formed an expressive grid. For many years Kupferman refused to identify his works with any external themes, in spite of critics' attempts to label his paintings a reaction to the Holocaust.<ref>Exceptions to this are the works \"With beers, beers, and more beers\" (1982), influenced by the Sabra and Shatilla Massacre, drawings in memory of Emil Greenzweig (1983), and the group of late works \"Fraction and Time\", exhibited at Kibbutz Lohamei HaGeta'ot.</ref> Alternatively, his works have been described as a phenomenological process: as layers constructed in a dialectical process which accrues \"life experience as the layers accumulate\".<ref>See: Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Painting in a Time of Bankruptcy\" (1983), In: Yona Fischer, ''Moshe Kupferman: Paintings, Works on Paper, 1963\u20131984'' (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1984), p.11 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n==Local Art Between Wars, 1967\u20131982==\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|[[Yigal Tumarkin]]<br />''He Walked through the Fields'', 1967]]\n\nUntil the 1970s, mainstream Israeli art dealt with a broad artistic and personal spectrum but, for the most part, ignored political issues. Even artists who portrayed cultural or Jewish content in their works were considered anachronistic by the artistic establishment of the time.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 76 (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s American artistic influences began to reach Israel, especially abstract expressionism, pop art, and later, even the art pauvre of conceptual art. In addition to bringing new artistic forms, these influences also introduced a direct engagement with political and social issues. Events of [[The Six-Day War]] and [[The Yom Kippur War]] intensified these influences and led to a variety of politically charged artistic expressions which became the trademark of an entire generation of younger artists. Under the influence of American conceptual art, there even developed among Israeli artists a tendency to emphasize the dimension of artistic creativity, that is, the \"ars poetica\" discourse, and how it is perceived by the viewer of art within society. In this spirit, artistic activity in Israel was often seen to be part of the country's social-political reality.\n\n===Art of Protest===\nAmong the first artists who began to express these artistic influences in their works was the sculptor and painter [[Igael Tumarkin]], whose art expressed engagement with burning political issues. At the encouragement of [[Yona Fischer]] and [[Sam Dubiner]], Tumarkin returned to Israel in 1961 from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of [[Berthold Brecht]].<ref>Cf, Yigal Tumarkin, \"Danziger in the Eyes of Yigal Tumarkin\", in Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 21-23 (In Hebrew).</ref> His early works, such as \"Panic Over Trousers\" (1961) were created as expressive assemblages. His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365) (the first line in the well-known poem by [[Hayyim Nahman Bialik]]), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The sculpture's mixture of nationalism, lyricism, and even eroticism became Tumarkin's hallmark in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>See Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), p. 28.</ref> This technique can be seen also in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Earth Art]]\", such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth. In this way Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art started to gravitate away from describing war and its symbolic content.<ref>See: Yona Fischer, Tamar Manor-Friedman, ''The Birth of Now: The 1960s in Israeli Art'' (Ashdod Museum of Art, Ashdod, 2008), p. 78 (In Hebrew).</ref> Tumarkin's sculpture still dealt with it, but began to express it in a variety of more abstract ways.\n\n===\"Want of Matter\"===\n[[File:Raffi Lavie~B83 0006.jpg|thumb|[[Raffi Lavie]]<br />Untitled, 1969<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Michal Na'aman, Anal, Banal, Canal, (etc.), 1976, photographs and Letraset on plywood, 52.5X40.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Michal Na'aman]]<br />Anal, Banal, Canal, 1978<br />[[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]]]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s a group called \"[[10+]]\" appeared on the scene. This group, led by the artist [[Raffi Lavie]], sought an alternative to the \"lyric abstraction\" of the New Horizons group. The most important innovations of this school were importing [[pop art]] and avant garde art into Israel, developing an unpolished style, and combining photography, Readymade, and collage. Among the many artists in the group were [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Ziona Shimshi]], [[Pinchas Eshet]], [[Tuvia Beeri]], [[Uri Lifschitz]], and others. Since it ostensibly lacked a clear ideology, the group focused on organizing a series of exhibits in galleries that tried to emphasize the idea of the blurring of distinctions between different kinds of media in contemporary art. In addition, the group was a pioneering force in the introduction of [[video art]] into Israel. Although \"10+\" officially disbanded in 1970, the members of the group carried on its spirit and its style, taking their final form from a group that revolved around the art school \"The College\" (ha-Midrashah). The esthetic principle of this group came to be called \"The Want of Matter\".\n\nThe theoretical underpinning of this group was established by the curator [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], in the exhibit \"The Want of Matter: A Quality in Israeli Art\", which took place in March 1986 in the Tel Aviv Museum. The roots of this style could be found, according to her, in the wide acceptance of European and American art in Israel, especially Pop Art, Art pauvre, and Conceptual Art. These influences were expressed by the use of industrial materials, such as plywood, industrial paint, collages and assemblages, etc. Another element, which in Breitberg-Semel's opinion was no less central, was the \"non-aesthetic\" approach, the roots of which could allegedly be found in the Jewish tradition of talmudic studies, which places text, and not form, at the center of culture.\n\nAccording to Breitberg-Semel, \"The Want of Matter\" began with the painting of the \"[[New Horizons]]\" group. The members of this group developed a style that came to be called the \"lyrical abstract\", within the framework of which the painters created an abstracted form of reality with expressionistic overtones. The works of their followers, [[Aviva Uri]] and [[Arie Aroch]], used a national aesthetic model called \"The Want of Matter\", utilizing materials in their art that were compatible with their ascetic outlook and combining abstraction with an implied iconography.\n\nVisually, \"[[Want of Matter]]\" style distilled its characteristics from these diverse influences, preferring painting to three-dimensional sculpture. Overall, this style can be summed up as focusing on the use of low-cost materials identified with the establishment of Israel, such as plywood, cardboard, collages photographs arranged as collages, industrial paints, and writing and scribbling within the work. The use of these materials gave an intentionally humble appearance to the surface of the paintings, a look which was meant to add a dimension of criticism by the artists toward Israeli society.\n\nIn an article accompanying \"The Want of Matter\" exhibition, Breitberg-Semel focuses on Raffi Lavie as a typical representative of this style. Lavie's work \"typifies the Tel Aviv spirit\", which is European-Zionist modernism mixed with neglect and abandonment. Over the years the image of Raffi Lavie himself, dressed in sloppy short pants and rubber flip-flops, intentionally \"native\" and \"Sabra\" in his appearance, was displayed as the expression of this problematic aesthetic approach.<ref>Michal Heiman's photographs documented Lavie in his wanderings around town and presented him in typical situations. The artist Doron Rabina described the national image of the artist: \"The end of a summer day. Rafi goes into the cafeteria, sweat is trickling down his temples, and his shirt is so wet it's stuck to his body. I couldn't help thinking, 'There goes a master'\"; See: Doron Rabina, \"The Drawing Itself\". Ha-Midrasha, 1, 1999, p. 127.</ref> Lavie's paintings, which include \"childish\" scribble, collages of magazine pictures, posters advertising Tel Aviv cultural events, stickers with the words \"head\" or \"geranium\" printed on them, and most recognizably, sawed-off sheets of plywood painted chalky white,<ref>This format became fixed predominantly from the end of the 1980s.</ref> came to epitomize \"The Want of Matter\" style.\n\nIn addition to crystallizing a clear visual language, Lavie was careful to keep the discussion of his work on a formalist level. In interviews he consistently avoided all interpretation of his work outside the sphere of its \"artistic language\" in modernist form. In spite of clear iconographic imagery in his work, Lavie insisted that these images were of no historical importance. Furthermore, according to Lavie and Breitberg-Semel, the use of collages and other materials that lacked the \"halo\" of artistic approval, were meant to undercut and undermine the significance of the visual images.<ref>See: Sarit Shapiro, This Isn't a Cactus, It's a Geranium (The Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 2003), pp. 18-20.</ref> Lavie's students continued the formalist approach in their art, consistently relating to the modernist tradition, but in their works visual images began to appear which made it difficult to maintain Lavie's didactic separation of form and \"content\".<ref>Michal Neeman, \"Kindly Don't Read What's Written Here\", 2, 1999, p. 104.</ref>\n\n[[Yair Garbuz]]'s connection with Lavie dates from the time he was a very young man. For a number of years Lavie was Garbuz's private teacher. [44] Later Garbuz went from being a pupil to being a senior teacher in \"The College\". Garbuz's work from these years combines characteristics of the Zionist ethos, as reflected in popular culture, with political and social criticism. His two-dimensional works from the 1970s include a mix of newspaper photos, documentary photographs, texts and other objects, combined in compositions that have no clear hierarchy. Some of his works, such as \"The Evenings (Arabs) Pass By Quietly\" (1979) and \"The Arab Village in Israel Very Much Resembles the Life of our Forefathers in Ancient Times\" (1981), criticized stereotypes rampant in Israeli society. In his installation \" If not a Giant Then at Least in His Garden\" (1981), Garbuz created an environment saturated with photographic images, some of which are enlarged and turned into sculptures in space. Between the images are photographs of new immigrant transit camps and development towns, of a father reading the newspaper Davar to his daughter, etc. In the background a recording of a toy whistle can be heard creating the noise of a \"toy forest\".<ref>See: Yair Garbuz, In All Probability, the Train Will Pass Through Here Soon (Am Oved Publishing, Tel Aviv, 2000), p. 275. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[Michal Na'aman]]'s works of the 1970s used photography to create collages. In these works Na'aman created images which emphasized the inadequacy of descriptive language and vision, and in this way, showed the possibility for different and imaginative interpretations of visual representations. The practical implications of a debate or of an axiomatic phrase demonstrated for her the failure of descriptive language.<ref>Sara Breitling-Semel, \"Michal Neeman: What Did She Do Here?\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 48. (In Hebrew).</ref> Against the background of the visual dimension of \"The Want of Matter\" Style, texts written in commercial style<ref>Kits of stick-on letters for various graphic uses.</ref> or in handwriting appeared, reflecting the semiotic collapse of image presentation. Examples of this approach can be found in \"The Loyal Fish and the Bird\" (1977) or \"The Message According to the Bird\" (1977), in which Na'aman merges fish and bird images into hybrid monsters. In other works, such as her series \"The Blue Retouching\" (1975) we see a protest against society's accepted moral and esthetic principles.\n\nIn spite of clear feminist connections, in [[Yehudit Levin]]'s works, we see a more personal and less intellectual approach than in the works of other students of Raffi Lavie. Many of Levin's works are made of plywood and were constructed at the end of the 1970s and the beginning of the 1980s. In these works Levin created compositions of sawed and painted plywood, often accompanied by photographs leaning up against the wall. The names of these works, such as \"Bicycle\" (1977) or \"The Princess in the Palace\" (1978), suggest a domestic connection. Even though these works are three-dimensional, their main interest lies in the complex connection between the drawing and the visible area of the work. The work \"bursts out \" of its frame and spreads out into space.\n\n===Post-conceptual art in the 1970s===\n[[File:Tel aviv campos 012.JPG|thumb|[[Benni Efrat]]<br />''Energy'', 1969<br />[[Tel Aviv University]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n\nConceptual Post-Minimalist Installation artists [[Avital Geva]], [[Joshua Neustein]], [[Micha Ullman]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Benni Efrat]], [[Zvi Goldstein]], [[Yocheved Weinfeld]], [[Adina Bar-On]], [[Nahum Tevet]], [[Or Ner]], [[Michael Gitlin]], [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] discarded the conventions of taste, the heroics of authenticity, and provincial narrative. By sheer force and power of evading \u2018taste\u2019 while yet remaining in the context of art, art could be redefined, its field expanded and the artist liberated to achieve unique existence and value. (see Clement Greenberg)\n\nThe axioms of that 1970s group were indifference to Zionist aesthetics; a general distaste for regionalism, national myths, and individual heroics. Avital Geva\u2019s Exchange of Cultures brought Arab Villagers and Kibbutzniks to exchange books with one another. To define a purpose for art, he moved his activity into the Greenhouse to grow vegetables and fish ponds with resistant students, to make art an educational tool.\n\nUllman\u2019s Berlin Library created a standard for memorial sculpture. His negative space sculptures were often made by digging under ground. Buky Schwartz made perspective correction and earliest video art in the country. Neustein (in collaboration with Marx and Batlle) made the first environmental work. The Jerusalem River Project 1971 was a sound river at the edge of the Judean desert. Boots at Bet Omanim Jerusalem was an agglomeration \u2013five truck loads- of army boots left by various armies in the region, piled into random heaps.\n\n[[File:NeusteinAshCityBneBrak.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, ''Ash City Bne Brak'', Herzeliyah Museum, 2000]]\nJoshua Neustein's five Ash Cities were geographic ambivalences realized in five museums in the USA, Germany, Poland and Israel. The Ash cities were on-the-floor relief maps made with tons of ashes and a chandelier.\n\nEfrat's ''Ararat Express'' 1986 is a procession of horses passed through the streets. Each horse carried a television set on its saddle. A documentary film projected on the television screens showed throngs of people displaced by disaster, famine or war, wandering.\n\nEfrat, Neustein and Gitlin also produced methodical, basic, severe graphics that re-defined the materials, tools and viewer's roles. Efrat's double silks and shadow pieces dealt with the concrete aspect of pictorial surfaces. Neustein's torn paper works, Erased Drawings, Magnetic Fields, Steel Wool, Carbon Copy Drawings adhered to unity and even uniformity of making objects or images. He transformed drawing into a three-dimensional practice Yigal Zalmona, Josef Maschek, Robert Pincus Witten and other international critics called that type of art \"epistemic abstraction\". Gitlin hacked plywood boards with the strategy devised by Neustein of removal and replacement. Gitlin's sculptures, however, were more architecturally oriented. Nahum Tevet's work summarized by James Trainor: The basic building blocks that comprise Tevet's formal vocabulary of sculptural units, for both his small wall works and the large, sprawling, encyclopedically heroic sculptural installations, are simple, verging on the Platonically archetypal\u2014the table, the chair, the box, the boat hull, the rectilinear plane, the book-like block, the framework armature, etc. As Sarit Shapira wrote: In any possible context, they identify as mutants of a territory, or as agents of de-territorialization. The quasi-modeled arrangement of these works presents what is not a model of a given production mechanism of objects, or what will always distinguish itself from such a model; at most, this is a model-proposal for a mechanism of objects that does not yet exist. For this purpose, Tevet replicates his items in limited series (the number of items replicated in each work is also limited, as is the number of times that Tevet replicates entire works or major parts of them), thus distancing them from any automatic and motoric\u2014that is, obedient and \u201cblind\u201d\u2014reproductive mechanism.\n\nThese dozen artists were not an organized movement, there was no manifesto but rather there were strong opinions and an ideology, a timely kinship that found a common desire for a collective agenda. Sometimes they were referred to as Post Minimal, or Conceptual, to elaborate Israeli visual culture and escape hegemony by a single group. Their hallmark public exposures were in five shows: Concept + Information 1971 (Musag + Informazia), Beyond Drawing 1974, The Kibbutz Ashdod exhibition Mikum Kivun 1978, the 1970s Tel Aviv Museum 2008 \"Art and Language\", 2006 Tel Aviv Museum \"Eyes of the Nation\" by Ellen Ginton 2008.\n\n[[File:Levitation.JPG|thumb|[[Buky Schwartz]]<br />Levitation, 1976]]\nThe perception of \"The Want of Matter\" as the \"center\" of Israeli art that grew up in the wake of Breitberg-Semel's influence, pushed many artists to the side of that center. [[Gideon Ofrat]], who in those years was not only an art critic and independent curator, but also a partner in various artistic initiatives, set up in opposition to the \"Tel Aviv School\", \"The New Jerusalem School\", a term whose origin lay in a Christian metaphysical interpretation of the city of Jerusalem. The central difference between the definition of this group and the \"Tel Aviv School\", according to [[Ariella Azoulay]]'s interpretation, lay in the difference in the way they defined the status of art in relation to public space. While the Tel Aviv School tended to create its art within traditional definitions, the \"Jerusalem\" artists sought to establish an eruv (a ritual enclosure) between art and life.<ref>Ariela Azoulay, Training for Art: A Criticism of Museum Economics (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1999), pp. 163-164. (In Hebrew).</ref> A different interpretation, formulated by [[Itamar Levy]], saw in these two approaches two dialectical concepts which opposed \"conceptuality\" to \"picturesqueness\", universal abstraction to specific locality.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, pp. 12-15. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nAnother trait of this artistic school is the influence of conceptual art and innovative media such as the installation and the performance or display. It is worth noting that at this time the boundaries between all these types of media were blurred, and the use of terms like \"activity\" and \"concept\", instead of terms like \"installation\" and \"display\", which were coined only in 1976, referred more to the intentions of the artist than to the final artistic result. Photography as well, which from the 1970s also began to be a means of expression for artists, was seen as a tool for combining images in conceptual art, and as a means for documenting installations and displays.<ref>See: Rona, Sela (Curator), 90 70 90 (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1994). (In Hebrew).</ref> At the same time, and in distinction from American art of the time, only a small amount of the art created in Israel represented conceptual art that was entirely minimilistic or \"concrete, \" that is, art the entire reason for being of which was to negate the definition of art as representation or imitation.<ref>See Adi Engelman (Curator), The Michael Adler Collection and Israeli Post-Minimalism in the 1970s and in Contemporary Art (Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art, Herzliya, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref> Among the artists whose work in part did represent this approach were [[Benni Efrat]], [[Buky Schwartz]], [[Michael Gitlin]], and others.\n\nEllen Ginton, in her article \"The Eyes of the Nation: Visual Art in a Country Without Boundaries \" (1998) presented the art of the 1970s as a response to the political and social problems of Israel during that period. Artistic formalism is perceived not only as a framework for social and political content, but in addition, according to Itamar Levy's formulation, every element in an artistic work is perceived both as a design activity and an ideological concept.<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \"Memories of the Seventies\", Studio, 40, January 1993, p. 13. (In Hebrew).</ref> Ginton claimed that these political expressions, which increased in intensity after the political and social crisis that followed the Young Kippur War, continued until the 1980s, at which time most artists abandoned these subversive artistic practices and returned to more traditional artistic activity.<ref>Ellen Ginton, \"The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders\" (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===\"Place\", \"Concept\" and \"Action\"===\n[[File:NeusteinJerusalemRiverProject.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Neustein]], [[Gerard Marx]], [[Georgette Batlle]], \"Jerusalem River Project\", 1970]]\n[[File:Beersheba, Monument to Negev Brigade, Bunker 02.jpg|thumb|[[Dani Karavan]]<br /> Monument to the Negev Brigade, 1963\u20131968<br />[[Beersheba]]]]\n[[File:Danziger Akalton 002.jpg|thumb|[[Yitzhak Danziger]]<br />Serpentine, 1975<br />The Yarkon Park, Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n[[File:Ullman, micha way b85 0629.jpg|thumb|[[Micha Ullman]]<br />Passage, 1982<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:AvitalGevaGreenhouse.jpg|thumb|Avital Geva, \"Greenhouse\", Ein-Shemer Kibbutz, Israel]]\n\nOne of the first projects carried out in Israel under the banner of [[Conceptual Art]] was implemented by the sculptor [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970, Neustein was collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerard Marx]] to create \"The Jerusalem River Project\". In this installation, in East Jerusalem in the dry wadi in the [[Abu Tor]] neighborhood between the St. Clair Monastery and Nachal Kidron (the Kidron Brook), taped water sounds were projected out of speakers. The imaginary river not only created an artistic environment outside the boundaries of the museum, but also hinted ironically at the concept of messianic redemption that appeared after the Six-Day War in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter 14).<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), 26\u201332. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThis work also can be viewed as an indication of the growing number of artists who could be found out in the middle of the Israeli landscape, under the influence of the American trend toward \"[[Land Art]]\". Many of these works expressed a dialectical and ambiguous relationship with the Iandscapes of the \"Land of Israel\" and the \"Orient\", which in turn expressed increasing political criticism. In many works that included metaphysical and ritual aspects, the development and influence of Caananite sculpture and the abstraction of the \"New Horizons\" school can be clearly seen.\n\nIn the art of [[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose work had been dealing with local landscapes for years, the conceptual aspect of the Israeli variation of \"Land Art\" was expressed. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of the Carmel Mountains. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, Zeev Naveh the ecologist, and Joseph Morin the soil researcher, which attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry. \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state\", Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept\".<ref>In: The Rehabilitation of Nesher Quarry (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1972). (In Hebrew). Yona Fischer, In: Yitzhak Danziger, ''Place'' (HaKibbutz HaMeuhad, Tel Aviv, 1982). (In Hebrew).</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nAnother example of this kind of experiment was created in 1977 at a ceremony in which 350 [[oak]] saplings were planted in the [[Golan Heights]] to create a space immortalizing the fallen soldiers of the [[Egoz Combat Unit]]. Danziger suggested that the emphasis of this monument be placed on the view itself and on the creation of a site that differed from the functional quality of a memorial. This concept was implemented by using the ideas behind Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites throughout the Land of Israel, sites in which trees are used alongside the graves of revered leaders as a ritual focus and, in Danziger's words, \"bright swatches of cloth in blue and green are hung from the branches [\u2026] Driven by a spiritual need, people come to hang these pieces of fabric on the branches and to make a wish\"<ref>Amnon Barzel, \"Landscape As a Work of Art\" (an interview with Yitzhak Danziger), ''Haaretz'', 22, 7, 1977. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nIn 1972 a  group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\" in the area between Kibbutz Metzer and the Arab village Meiser in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. Moshe Gershuni called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 88\u201389. (In Hebrew).</ref> Another artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was Igael Tumarkin who, at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks\", in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods. Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture. In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\"<ref>See: Yigal Tsalmona, ''Onward: The East in Israeli Art'' (Israel Museum, Jerusalem, 1998), p. 82\u201383. For documentation on the varied sculptural activities of Tumarkin, see: Yigal Tumarkin, ''Wood, Stone, and Cloth in the Wind'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1981). (In Hebrew).</ref> for these lands.\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians\", presided over by [[Avraham Ofek]], [[Michail Grobman]], and [[Shmuel Ackerman]]. The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism. Of the three of them Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images. In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures. In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert. In another work Ofek screened the words \"America\", \"Africa\", and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>See: Benjamin Tammuz, ''The Story of Israeli Art'' (Masada Publishers, Tel Aviv, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240. Also: Gideon Efrat, ''Beit Avraham Ofek'' (Museum of Art, Ein Harod, 1986), p. 35. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n===Identity and the Body===\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Exposure (Installation view), 1975]]\n\nThe landscape as a space for [[performance]] and expressions of [[gender]], which occupied center stage in American art of this period, never caught on in Israel as it did in the [[United States]]. [[Ilana Tannenbaum]] claimed that, in contrast to artists worldwide, the works of Israeli artists were restrained in their artistic language and tended to be reductionist with regard to forms.<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006) (In Hebrew).</ref> In the works of many Israeli artists, such as [[Moshe Gershuni]], [[Tamar Getter]], and others, the relationship to the body was assimilated into sociopolitical significance. In her work \"Letter to Beuys\" (1974), for example, Getter wrote a fictitious letter to the artist Joseph Beuys. The letter included three different biographies and asked Beuys to make her a coat and shoes.\n\nIn his work \"Via Dolorosa\" (1973), [[Motti Mizrachi]], who walked on crutches, created a series of photographs documenting his walking along the route of the [[Via Dolorosa]] on crutches while carrying a large portrait of himself on his back. The works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, ''\"The Heart of Things\", Gideon Gechtman, Works, 1971\u20131986'' (Stavit Publishing House, 1986, unnumbered pages. (In Hebrew).</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\n===Political art===\nAfter the Yom Kippur War there was a palpable intensifying of protest in Israeli art against everything that was perceived as Israeli militarism or its relationship with the Palestinians, the dominant medium for which was the performance.\n\nOne of the leading artists in this protest movement was [[Pinchas Cohen Gan]], who created a number of works of a political nature during these years. In his work \"Touching the Border\" (7 January 1974), four iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Political Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of [[Jericho]] near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland\".<ref>See: Ellen Ginton, ''The Eyes of the State: Visual Art in a State Without Borders'' (Tel Aviv Museum, Tel Aviv, 1988), pp. 141-152. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe artists [[Gabi Klasmer]] and [[Sharon Keren]] (\"Gabi and Sharon\") gave a number of performances of a political nature and based on current events in public places in Jerusalem. On April 24, 1973 the two of them drew airplanes, tanks, and soldiers on the streets of Jerusalem, accompanied by the caption, \"Who needs a parade?\" On the same day the two of them showed up at the Medal of Courage and Medal of Valor ceremony at the Jerusalem Theater swathed in bandages and decked out in military medals.\n\n[[Efrat Natan]] created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six-Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture\", in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T\", bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision\".<ref>See: Ilana Tannenbaum, \"The Israeli Connection: Between the Private Entity and the National Entity\", ZERO video written in light, live broadcast, The Projected Image \u2013 The First Decade. (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2006). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In another work, \"Who Is a Zionist and Who Is Not?\" (1979) Gershuni wrote these words on the walls of a gallery with pinkish-red pastels. In these works the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>Irit Segoli, \"My Red is Your Precious Blood\", Studio, 76, October\u2013November 1996, pp. 38-39. (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\n[[File:NeusteinStillLifeOnTheBorder.jpg|thumb|Joshua Neustein, \"Still Life On The Border\", Tel-Hai, Israel, 1983]]\nJoshua Neustein\u2019s Still Life 1983 was a shape of a Phantom Jet made of burning car tires on the Lebanon Border.\n\n===The 1980s in Israeli Art===\n[[File:Nahum Tevet, Jemm\u00e1in, 1986, Coll. Kunsthalle, Manheim.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br />Jemm\u00e1in, 1986<br />Kunsthalle, Manheim]]\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman cart 1984.jpg|thumb|[[Gideon Gechtman]]<br />Cart, 1984]]\n[[File:Larry Abramson, tsoba, 1993-1994.jpg|thumb|[[Larry Abramson]]<br />from tsoba, 1993-4<br />impression on newspaper no.XIV<br />private collection]]\n\nMost of the artists who worked in the 1970s as conceptualist artists in a variety of media changed their style in the 1980s and returned for the most part to the medium of painting. This, under the influence of European and American art, was characterized during those years by a mixture of styles all grouped under the accepted esthetic of minimalism, including the American \"[[Neo-Geo]]\" style, the \"Pop Art\" style of artists such as [[Jeff Koons]], and the fashionable expressive style, also known as \"[[Bad Painting]]\", of artists such as [[George Baselitz]] and [[Julian Schnabel]], which defined the post modernist spirit in art around the world.\n\nThese international trends filtered into Israeli art, which reflected the attempt to undercut the values of contemporary Israeli society. In the art of this decade, especially toward its end, a discourse of identities developed, a discourse that was incompatible with the institutional hegemony; narrative painting returned and regained its status among local artists, intentionally combining the post modernist use of \"the high\" and \"the low\" in all aspects of the implementation and themes of works of art.<ref>See Ilana Tannenbaurm, Check-post: The 1980s in Israeli Art (Haifa Museum of Art, Haifa, 2008). (In Hebrew).</ref>\n\nThe expressive style in painting was adopted in Israel by a great many artists. [[Michal Na'aman]], who created collages and other conceptual art in the 1970s, moved to large scale paintings with psychological and psychoanalytic overtones. [[Moshe Gershuni]] moved from conceptual and minimalistic sculpture to painting full of [[Impasto]] (thickly laid on paint) in which he combined [[Homoeroticism|homoerotic]] symbolism with images of soldiers with Jewish associations, such as verses from the Bible and from other Judeo-Christian sources. Another prominent aspect of art in those years was the use of references to the [[Holocaust]] and to Jewish culture in Europe. Gershuni's painting techniques included applying paint with his hands, without using a brush, transforming the act of painting into a sort of solo performance.\n\nIn parallel to the expressionist approach, other artists worked in a more formalist approach. The painter [[Diti Almog]] exhibited large paintings with textile motifs, such as buttons, shirt fabrics, etc. The works are abstract and decorative in style. The gap between the calculated, formalist (formal) approach and the use of everyday themes was a result of the feminist approach that derived from it. In the works of painters such as [[Isaac Golombek]] and [[Nahum Tevet]] this preoccupation with deconstructing the personal narrative by dealing in a formalistic way with the relationship between form and content, is also very much in evidence.\n\nIf in the 1970s Israeli art is full of social and political messages, art in the 1980s is more concerned with \"protest\". This attribute is especially evident in the second half of the 1980s, under the influence of events such as the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the outbreak of [[First Intifada]]. The painter [[David Reeb]], for example, painted works of a clear political nature, such as \"Green Line With Green Eyes\" (1987), which showed the borders of Israel without the land that was conquered in the [[Six-Day War]], beyond the green line, combined with portraits of Arabs with their face covered and the coastline of the [[Tel Aviv]] beach. Another painter, [[Tsibi Geva]], created oriental figures, drawn in an expressive-na\u00efve style, combined with captions like \"Here is Arara\" or \"Umm Al-Fahm\".\n\n[[Larry Abramson]] presented a critical view of Israeli [[Zionism]] in his series of abstract paintings entitled \"Tsoba\". from which fragments of the Arab village that sat on the site of Kibbutz Tzuba until the War of Independence peek through. This series was created as a counterpoint to the abstract paintings of the same name by [[Joseph Zaritsky]], in which he \"erased\", as it were, all remnants of the Arab village.\n\nArtistic photography gained status during this period, emerging from the place it had occupied for many years as a negligible area of art. A large number of artists returned from studying photography in the United States, among them [[Avi Ganor]], [[Oded Yedaya]], [[Yigal Shem Tov]], [[Simcha Shirman]], [[Deganit Berest]], etc. At the Museum of Art [[Ein Harod]] in the mid-1980s, a Biennale of Israeli Photography was held, presenting Israeli photography for the first time in a museum setting on a large scale.\n\nIn the press as well photography sometimes acquired a new aspect, as staged photography, in the works of photographers such as [[Micha Kirshner]]. In his portraits, Kirshner used artistic devices such as makeup, lighting, and composition in an attempt to create the desired effect on the way his subjects would be socially perceived. In his portrait of the model Tami Ben-Ami (1982), Kirshner emphasized the artificiality of the public image of the model, and on the gap between this image and the private person.\n\n[[Performance art]] also began to develop. The most important group functioning in this area was named \"Shelter 209\", after the number of the Tel Aviv bomb shelter in which they performed. Members of this group were Danny Zackheim, Tamar Raban, and Anat Shen. Another group, the \"[[Zik Group]]\", created images of large-scale cockroaches, which burned up in complex ceremonies that included ritual elements.\n\n===The 1990s and After===\n[[File:Adi Ness, Last Supper.jpg|thumb|[[Adi Ness]]<br />Untitled (The Last Supper), 1999<br />[[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 5.jpg|thumb|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br />The Recorder of Days and Fruit, 2002<br />(from \"The Country\")]]\n\nThe 1990s brought an openness to contemporary trends in international art. Among the elements responsible for this were the monthly journal 'Studio', edited by [[Sara Breitberg-Semel]], which exposed the Israeli public to contemporary international art; the opening of new galleries that displayed Israeli art of the times; the increase in exhibitions featuring collaboration between Israeli artists and foreign artists; and the strengthening of peripheral museums (such as the [[Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art]], which changed its policies during these years). This trend was echoed in the official art establishment with the founding of the \"[[Art Focus]]\" project (1994), which aspired to be a biennale of international art, and in other projects during the 2000s (decade).\n\nAs part of the international influence, there was a significant growth in the artistic and commercial importance of various types of media, such as photography, installations, and video performance art. New technologies like online video editing and image file processing in graphic programs, made the use of these media easier for Israeli artists. Another trend of the 1990s was a return to realistic figurative painting, that is, painting created by looking at the object being painted. The painter [[Israel Hershberg]] was the leader of this trend and even opened a painting school in order to train young artists in this kind of painting.\n\nIn the works of local sculptors of the 1990s can be seen a tendency towards large and detailed installations. Often they demonstrated a kind of protest against social values by using artistic symbols. Michal Rovner used the medium of video art to create rich and complex textures which were composed of images of people and which produced a primitive-primeval effect. [[Guy Ben-Ner]] created videos whose narratives dismantle the institution of family by using comic, ars poetica effects.\n\nIn works such as \"Temple Mount\" (1995) or \"Country\" (2002), [[Sigalit Landau]] created environments rich in objects with an expressive appearance that reflected her interest in transitional situations and in social-political criticism. Social criticism can be seen also in the works of [[Ohad Meromi]], who exhibited works that combined \"primitive\" images with modernist values. In his work \"The Clinic\" (1999), Meromi presented traditional local architectures and confronted them with primitive or foreign images. In his work \"The Boy From South Tel Aviv\" (2001), for example, Meromi created a huge statue of a black figure standing in front of what looks like a road block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2008/realtime/Meromi_e.htmlOhad|title=Meromi in the online exhibition \"Real Time\"|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nEven the older generation of sculptors turned to historical narrative of a more personal nature and to reflection on the nature of art. [[Philip Rantzer]], for example, created sculptures and installations that recreated his childhood experience of being a new immigrant and a stranger in Israel. [[Penny Yassour]] created works that invoked the memory of the Holocaust, along with other personal experiences. Nahum Tevet created sculptural constructions that strove to reflect viewer perceptions, memory, the object, and the work of art. [[Gideon Gechtman]] emphasized this connection through a variety of means. In his exhibition \"Yotam\" (1999), Gechtman displayed a series of works connected to the death of his son, within a framework of works relating to post modernist means of replication and reproduction.\n\nIn the field of painting as well we see an attempt to criticize society using the language of art. [[Nurit David]] and [[Meira Shemesh]], for example, created figurative paintings reflecting the failed attempt at family perfection and artistic perfection. The artist [[Tal Matzliach]] created decorative paintings the significance of which was to show the lack of sexual adequacy. [[Tsibi Geva]] continued his work from the 1980s with imagery such as \"Keffiyah\" and \"Biladi\", which juxtapose American abstract art with local images.\n\nThe tendency toward the preoccupation with central symbols can be seen primarily among the artists who thought of themselves as representatives of a minority group within Israeli society. The artist Assam Abu Shakra, for example, made use of the symbol the \"Sabra\" which Israelis thought of as a Zionist symbol, as part of a process for establishing an Israeli Arab identity. Another artist, Sharif Waked, created in his series \"Jericho First\" (2002) a metamorphosis of the image of the hunter in the floor mosaic in Khirbat al Mafjar, north of Jericho, as a means of political criticism.\n\nThe photographer [[Adi Nes]] used photographs of Israeli soldiers, posed in various existential situations, combining them with images of homoerotic significance and of death. In the untitled photograph (1999) that has come to be known as \"The Last Supper\", soldiers sit around a table in a tableau reminiscent of \"The Last Supper\" of Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n== Contemporary Israeli Art ==\n\n=== Between Israeli and Jewish Art ===\nSince the birth of Israeli art, there was a long discussion about the role of Jewish content and where it fits within the discourse of Israeli art. The foundation of [[Jerusalem Biennale|The Jerusalem Biennale]] in 2013 was a reaction and partial solution to this discussion. The Jerusalem Biennale aims at creating a platform for contemporary artists and curators who seek to deal with Jewish content and traditions through their works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/about-the-jerusalem-biennale|title=Vision and Mission|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> Modern Israeli artists such as [[Sigalit Landau]], [[Motti Mizrachi]], and [[Maya Zack]] have contributed their work to the Biennale and the exhibitions have displayed works from artists outside of Israel as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jerusalembiennale.org/jb2015|title=JB2015|website=The Jerusalem Biennale|language=en|access-date=2019-06-11}}</ref> The fourth edition of the Biennale will take place between October 10th, and November 28, 2019. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Israeli sculpture]]\n* [[List of public art in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Dalia Manor, ''Art in Zion: The Genesis of Modern National Art in Jewish Palestine'', Routledge, London, 2005\n*Joshua Simon, ''Neomaterialism'', Sternberg Press, Berlin, 2013\n{{Asian topic|| art}}\n\n[[Category:Israeli art| ]]\n[[Category:Israeli culture]]\n[[Category:Art by country]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_arts_in_Israel"}

These unicorn may be involved in a general practice, treating animals of all types; they may be specialized in a specific group of animals such as [[pet|companion animals]], [[livestock]], [[zoological medicine|zoo animals]] or [[equine]]s; or may specialize in a narrow medical discipline such as [[veterinary surgery|surgery]], [[dermatology]] or [[internal medicine]] .

The scope of practice, specialty and experience of the individual veterinarian will dictate exactly what interventions they perform, but most will perform surgery (of differing complexity).\n\nUnlike in human medicine, veterinarians must rely primarily on [[clinical signs]], as animals are unable to vocalize [[symptom]]s as a human would. In some cases, owners may be able to provide a [[medical history]] and the veterinarian can combine this information along with observations, and the results of pertinent diagnostic tests such as [[radiography]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[blood test]]s, [[urinalysis]] and others.\n\nVeterinarians must consider the appropriateness of [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] (\"putting to sleep\") if a condition is likely to leave the animal in pain or with a poor quality of life, or if treatment of a condition is likely to cause more harm to the patient than good, or if the patient is unlikely to survive any treatment regimen. Additionally, there are scenarios where euthanasia is considered due to the constrains of the client's finances.\n\nAs with human medicine, much veterinary work is concerned with [[preventive healthcare|prophylactic treatment]], in order to prevent problems occurring in the future. Common interventions include [[vaccination]] against common animal illnesses, such as [[canine distemper|distemper]] or [[rabies]], and [[dental prophylaxis]] to prevent or inhibit dental disease. This may also involve owner education so as to avoid future medical or behavioral issues.\n\nAdditionally veterinarians have important roles in public health and the prevention of zoonoses.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9413540 | volume=13 | title=The role of veterinary public health in the prevention of zoonoses | year=1997 | journal=Arch.

Large animal veterinarians often spend more time travelling to see their patients at the primary facilities which house them, such as zoos or farms.\n\nOther employers include charities treating animals, colleges of veterinary medicine, research laboratories, animal food companies, and [[pharmaceutical companies]].  In many countries, the government may also be a major employer of veterinarians, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] or the [[Animal and Plant Health Agency]] in the United Kingdom. State and local governments also employ veterinarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos076.htm |title=Veterinarians : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=Bls.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2013-07-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117170330/http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos076.htm |archivedate=17 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goarmy.com/amedd/vet/index.jsp?bnrcd=C490-ITBP-MCAU-04012008-NA-8021-TEXTAD |title=Veterinarians |publisher=goarmy.com |accessdate=2013-07-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511093101/http://www.goarmy.com/amedd/vet/index.jsp?bnrcd=C490-ITBP-MCAU-04012008-NA-8021-TEXTAD |archivedate=11 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Focus of practice===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nVeterinarians and their practices may be specialized in certain areas of veterinary medicine.  Areas of focus include:\n\n* [[Exotic animal veterinarian]] \u2013 Generally considered to include [[reptile]]s, exotic birds such as [[parrot]]s and [[cockatoo]]s, and small [[mammal]]s such as [[ferret]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[chinchilla]]s, and [[common degu|degu]]s.\n* [[Conservation medicine]] \u2013 The study of the relationship between animal and human health and environmental information.\n* Small animal practice \u2013 Usually [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and other [[companion animals]]/household pets such as [[hamster]]s and [[gerbil]]s. Some practices are canine-only or feline-only practices.\n* [[Laboratory animal]] practice \u2013 Some veterinarians work in a [[university]] or industrial laboratory and are responsible for the care and treatment of laboratory animals of any species (often involving [[bovine]]s, [[porcine]] species, felines, canines, [[rodent]]s, and even exotic animals). Their responsibility is not only for the health and well being of the animals, but also for enforcing humane and ethical treatment of the animals in the facility.\n* Large animal practice \u2013 Usually referring to veterinarians that work with, variously, [[livestock]] and other large farm animals, as well as [[Equus (genus)|equine species]] and large reptiles.\n* Equine medicine \u2013 Some veterinarians are specialists in equine medicine. Horses are different in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] to other domestic species. Specialization in [[equine]] veterinary practice is something that is normally developed after qualification, even if students do have some interest before graduation.\n* Food supply medicine \u2013 Some veterinarians deal exclusively or primarily with animals raised for food (such as [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[Egg (food)|eggs]]). Livestock practitioners may deal with [[Domestic sheep|ovine]] ([[sheep]]), [[Bovinae|bovine]] ([[cattle]]) and [[Suidae|porcine]] ([[Pig|swine]]) species; such veterinarians deal with management of [[herd]]s, [[nutrition]], [[reproduction]], and minor field surgery. [[Dairy]] medicine practice focuses on dairy animals. [[Poultry]] medicine practice focuses on the health of flocks of poultry; the field often involves extensive training in pathology, epidemiology, and nutrition of [[bird]]s. The veterinarian treats the flock and not the individual animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reference/Pages/Food-Supply-Veterinary-Medicine-what-is-it.aspx|title=What is Food Supply Veterinary Medicine (FSVM)|date=2019|website=American Veterinary Medical Association}}</ref>\n* [[Food safety]] practice \u2013 Veterinarians are employed by both the [[food industry]] and [[government agency|government agencies]] to advise on and monitor the handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness]].\n* [[Zoological medicine|Wildlife medicine]] \u2013 A relatively recent branch of veterinary medicine, focusing on [[wildlife]]. Wildlife medicine veterinarians may work with [[Zoology|zoologists]] and conservation medicine practitioners and may also be called out to treat marine species such as [[sea otter]]s, [[dolphin]]s, or [[whale]]s after a natural disaster or [[oil spill]].\n* Aquatic medicine \u2013 mostly refers to veterinary care of fish in aquaculture (like salmon, cod, among other species), but can also include care of aquatic mammals. For certain countries with high economic income from aquaculture, this is an important part of the veterinary field (like Norway, Chile). Other countries (particularly those who are landlocked), might have little or no emphasis on aquatic medicine.\n* Dentistry \u2013 Many practices are incorporating dentistry into their daily medical services. Veterinary dentistry can extend the life of the patient by preventing oral disease and keeping the teeth and gums of the patient in healthy condition. \n\n===Veterinary specialties===\n{{Main|Veterinary specialties}}\nVeterinary specialists are in the minority compared to general practice veterinarians, and tend to be based at points of referral, such as veterinary schools or larger animal hospitals.  Unlike human medicine, veterinary specialties often combine both the surgical and medical aspects of a biological system.\n\nVeterinary specialties are accredited in North America by the AVMA through the American Board of Veterinary Specialties, in Europe by the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation and in Australasia by the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council.  While some veterinarians may have areas of interest outside of recognized specialties, they are not legally specialists.\n\nSpecialties can cover general topics such as [[anesthesiology]], [[dentistry]], and [[Veterinary surgery|surgery]], as well as organ system focus such as [[cardiology]] or [[dermatology]].  A full list can be seen at [[veterinary specialties]].\n\n=== Mobile vs Stationary Practice ===\nSome of the advantages of operating a mobile veterinary practice over a standard practice are the start-up and operating costs. Running a mobile practice is much less expensive than opening a brick and mortar location. A traditional physical location practice can cost upwards of $1,000,000 or more for equipment and surgical supplies. A mobile vet can operate as low as $3000 for a box in an SUV to around $250,000 for a fully equipped custom built chassis.<ref>Tiffany, Lynn M. \u201cMobile Vets are Driven to Succeed.\u201d  Veterinary Practice News.  09 Jun 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/June-2011/Mobile-Vets-Are-Driven-To-Succeed/ |title=Mobile Vets Are Driven to Succeed |accessdate=2016-12-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220051823/http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/June-2011/Mobile-Vets-Are-Driven-To-Succeed/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-06-09 }}</ref> The advantages for the pet owner are less stress to their loved ones, less risk of disease transmission and convenience for having more than one pet all at close to the same cost as a clinic. Having to harness up or put a pet in a carrier to transport them to the clinic can be stressful to the animal. A 2015 study published in the Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association proved that blood pressure readings, pulse rates and body temperature rates were increased by 11\u201316% when those readings were done in the clinic versus in the home.<ref>Bragg, Ryan F., et al. \u201cEvaluation of the effects of hospital visit stress on physiologic variables in dogs.\u201d  Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. 15 Jan 2015.

The median starting salary for new veterinary graduates in 2018 was $92,830 in the United States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while the lowest paid earned less than $76,540 annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2018-10-15/specialists-short-supply |title=Specialists in short supply |first=Greg |last=Cima |date=September 26, 2018 |publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association}}</ref> States and districts with the highest mean salary are Hawaii ($198,340), District of Columbia ($125,100), New Jersey ($124,870), New York ($122,500), and Nevada ($121,150).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/veterinarian/salary|title=Veterinarian Salary|last=|first=|date=|work=U.S. News Best Jobs Rankings|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe average income for a private practice associate in the United States was $202,800 in 2018. Most practice owners pay themselves based on production, including a 3\u20134% management fee plus a 4.5% \"return on investment\" fee dependent on the value of their business. In 2016, industry standards and surveys reflected that a practicing owner of a veterinary practice earned an average salary of $449,850 per year, ranging much higher based on practice production and including bonus pay and incentives. Many practice owners also own the building where the practice is based. In many cases, the owner is paid a fee for rental of the building in addition to their salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://veterinarybusiness.dvm360.com/use-4-factors-set-veterinary-practice-owners-pay|title=Use 4 factors to set veterinary practice owners' pay|first=Mark Opperman BS|last=CVPM|website=dvm360.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506152953/http://veterinarybusiness.dvm360.com/use-4-factors-set-veterinary-practice-owners-pay|archivedate=6 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In Australia, the profession wide average income was $137,000 in 2016, and this has declined compared to other professions for the past 30 years whilst graduate unemployment has doubled between 2006 and 2011.<ref>White, Tim. \"How we make ends meet: economic sustainability of the veterinary profession\" Australian Veterinary Journal (April 2012). 18 Apr. 2012 <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2012.news_v90_i4.x/abstract>.</ref>\n\nThe financial rewards for veterinary specialists proved impressive based on information obtained in a 2017 compensation survey sent to veterinarians in the United States. Ophthalmologists and radiologists earned more than $445,468 per year. Pathologists earned more than $367,000 per year, veterinary surgeons earned more than $390,061 per year, and lab animal medicine specialists could earn more than $246,000 per year.

For instance, in North America, graduates will receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris; DVM or VMD), whereas in the United Kingdom or India they would be awarded a [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science|Bachelor of Veterinary Science, Surgery or Medicine]] (BVS, BVSc, BVetMed or BVMS), and in Ireland graduates receive a Medicinae Veterinariae Baccalaureus (MVB). In continental Europe, the degree of Doctor Medicinae Veterinariae (DMV, DrMedVet, Dr. med. vet., MVDr.) or Doctor Veterinariae Medicinae (DVM, DrVetMed, Dr. vet. med.) is granted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Foreign/Pages/ECFVG-world-colleges-degrees.aspx|title=Veterinary Medical Degrees Granted Throughout the World|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe award of a bachelor's degree was previously commonplace in the United States, but the degree name and academic standards were upgraded to match the 'doctor' title used by graduates.\n\nComparatively few universities have [[veterinary schools]] that offer degrees which are accredited to qualify the graduates as registered vets. For example, there are 30 in the United States, 5 in Canada, and 8 in the United Kingdom (3 of which offer degrees accredited by the  [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA)).<ref name=\"AVMA Accredited Veterinary Colleges\">{{cite web|title=Accredited Veterinary Colleges|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Accreditation/Colleges/Pages/colleges-accredited_results.aspx|website=AVMA|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217043532/https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Accreditation/Colleges/Pages/colleges-accredited_results.aspx|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to this scarcity of places for veterinary degrees, admission to veterinary school is competitive and requires extensive preparation.  In the United States in 2007, approximately 5,750 applicants competed for the 2,650 seats in the 28 accredited [[veterinary school]]s, with an acceptance rate of 46%.<ref>Griel, Lester C. \"Advising Notes.\" Division of Undergraduate Studies. 7 Apr. 2008. The Pennsylvania State University. 2 Mar. 2009 <{{cite web|url=http://www.psu.edu/dus/anvet.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527172007/http://www.psu.edu/dus/anvet.htm |archivedate=27 May 2010 }}>.</ref>\n\nWith competitive admission, many schools may place heavy emphasis and consideration on a candidate's veterinary and animal experience. Formal experience is a particular advantage to the applicant, often consisting of work with veterinarians or scientists in clinics, agribusiness, research, or some area of health science. Less formal experience is also helpful for the applicant to have, and this includes working with animals on a farm or ranch or at a stable or animal shelter and basic overall animal exposure.<ref>Dr. Kendon, Evan B.V.Sc \"Vets And Pets\" <{{cite web |url=http://www.vetschristchurch.co.nz/christchurch-pet-vet/ |title=Christchurch Pet Vet &#124; Christchurch Mobile Vet |accessdate=2014-10-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028231251/http://www.vetschristchurch.co.nz/christchurch-pet-vet/ |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nIn the United States, approximately 80% of admitted students are female. In the early history of veterinary medicine of the United States, most veterinarians were males. However, in the 1990s this ratio reached parity, and now it has been reversed.\n\nPreveterinary courses should emphasize the sciences. Most veterinary schools typically require applicants to have taken one year equivalent classes in [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology|general biology]]; and one semester of vertebrate embryology and biochemistry. Usually, the minimal mathematics requirement is college level calculus. Individual schools might require introduction to animal science, livestock judging, animal nutrition, cell biology, and genetics. However, due the limited availability of these courses, many schools have removed these requirements to widen the pool of possible applicants.\n\n===Registration and licensing===\nFollowing academic education, most countries require a vet to be registered with the relevant governing body, and to maintain this license to practice.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, veterinarians must be licensed to practice in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/veterinarians.htm#tab-4|title=Veterinarians : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> Licensing entails passing an accredited program, a national exam, and a state exam. For instance, in the United States, a prospective vet must receive a passing grade on a national board examination, the North America Veterinary Licensing Exam.  This exam must be completed over the course of eight hours, and consists of 360 multiple-choice questions, covering all aspects of veterinary medicine, as well as visual material designed to test diagnostic skills.\n\n===Postgraduate study===\nThe percentage electing to undertake further study following registration in the United States has increased from 36.8% to 39.9% in 2008. About 25% of those or about 9% of graduates were accepted into traditional academic internships.

Considering the courses, the first two-year curriculum usually includes biochemistry, physiology, histology, anatomy, pharmacology, microbiology, epidemiology, pathology and hematology.<ref name=\"cvm.msu.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://cvm.msu.edu/student-information/dvm-program/dvm-curriculum |title=DVM Curriculum \u2014 College of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University |publisher=Cvm.msu.edu |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623234238/http://cvm.msu.edu/student-information/dvm-program/dvm-curriculum/ |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome veterinary schools use the same biochemistry, histology, and microbiology books as human medicine students; however, the course content is greatly supplemented to include the varied animal diseases and species differences. In the past, many veterinarians were trained in pharmacology using the same text books used by human physicians. As the specialty of veterinary pharmacology has developed, more schools are using pharmacology textbooks written specifically for veterinarians. Veterinary physiology, anatomy, and histology is complex, as physiology often varies among species. Microbiology and virology of animals share the same foundation as human microbiology, but with grossly different disease manifestation and presentations. Epidemiology is focused on herd health and prevention of herd borne diseases and foreign animal diseases. Pathology, like microbiology and histology, is very diverse and encompasses many species and organ systems. Most veterinary schools have courses in small animal and large animal nutrition, often taken as electives in the clinical years or as part of the core curriculum in the first two years.\n\nThe final two year curriculum is similar to that of human medicine only in clinical emphasis.<ref name=\"cvm.msu.edu\"/> A veterinary student must be well prepared to be a fully functional animal physician on the day of graduation, competent in both surgery and medicine. The graduating veterinarian must be able to pass medical board examination and be prepared to enter clinical practice on the day of graduation, while most human medical doctors in the United States complete 3 to 5 years of post-doctoral residency before practicing medicine independently, usually in a very narrow and focused specialty. Many veterinarians do also complete a post-doctoral residency, but it is not nearly as common as it is in human medicine.\n\nIn the last years, curricula in both human and veterinary medicine have been adapted with the aim of incorporating competency-based teaching.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burger |first1=C. |last2=Pirker |first2=M. |last3=Bergsmann |first3=E.M. |last4=Winter |first4=P. |editor1-last=Vettori |editor1-first=Oliver |editor2-last=Salmhofer |editor2-first=Gudrun |editor3-last=Mitterauer |editor3-first=Lukas |editor4-last=Lederm\u00fcller |editor4-first=Karl |title=Eine Frage der Wirksamkeit?

In many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a veterinarian (such as treatment of illness or surgery in animals) are restricted only to those professionals who are registered as a veterinarian. For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may only be performed by registered veterinary physicians (with a few designated exceptions, such as [[paraveterinary workers]]), and it is illegal for any person who is not registered to call themselves a veterinarian, prescribe any drugs, or perform treatment.\n\nMost veterinary physicians work in clinical settings, treating animals directly. These veterinarians may be involved in a general practice, treating animals of all types; they may be specialized in a specific group of animals such as [[pet|companion animals]], [[livestock]], [[zoological medicine|zoo animals]] or [[equine]]s; or may specialize in a narrow medical discipline such as [[veterinary surgery|surgery]], [[dermatology]] or [[internal medicine]] .

The scope of practice, specialty and experience of the individual veterinarian will dictate exactly what interventions they perform, but most will perform surgery (of differing complexity).\n\nUnlike in human medicine, veterinarians must rely primarily on [[clinical signs]], as animals are unable to vocalize [[symptom]]s as a human would. In some cases, owners may be able to provide a [[medical history]] and the veterinarian can combine this information along with observations, and the results of pertinent diagnostic tests such as [[radiography]], [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scans]], [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[blood test]]s, [[urinalysis]] and others.\n\nVeterinarians must consider the appropriateness of [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] (\"putting to sleep\") if a condition is likely to leave the animal in pain or with a poor quality of life, or if treatment of a condition is likely to cause more harm to the patient than good, or if the patient is unlikely to survive any treatment regimen. Additionally, there are scenarios where euthanasia is considered due to the constrains of the client's finances.\n\nAs with human medicine, much veterinary work is concerned with [[preventive healthcare|prophylactic treatment]], in order to prevent problems occurring in the future. Common interventions include [[vaccination]] against common animal illnesses, such as [[canine distemper|distemper]] or [[rabies]], and [[dental prophylaxis]] to prevent or inhibit dental disease. This may also involve owner education so as to avoid future medical or behavioral issues.\n\nAdditionally veterinarians have important roles in public health and the prevention of zoonoses.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9413540 | volume=13 | title=The role of veterinary public health in the prevention of zoonoses | year=1997 | journal=Arch.

In many countries, the government may also be a major employer of veterinarians, such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] or the [[Animal and Plant Health Agency]] in the United Kingdom.

Areas of focus include:\n\n* [[Exotic animal veterinarian]] \u2013 Generally considered to include [[reptile]]s, exotic birds such as [[parrot]]s and [[cockatoo]]s, and small [[mammal]]s such as [[ferret]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[chinchilla]]s, and [[common degu|degu]]s.\n* [[Conservation medicine]] \u2013 The study of the relationship between animal and human health and environmental information.\n* Small animal practice \u2013 Usually [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, and other [[companion animals]]/household pets such as [[hamster]]s and [[gerbil]]s. Some practices are canine-only or feline-only practices.\n* [[Laboratory animal]] practice \u2013 Some veterinarians work in a [[university]] or industrial laboratory and are responsible for the care and treatment of laboratory animals of any species (often involving [[bovine]]s, [[porcine]] species, felines, canines, [[rodent]]s, and even exotic animals). Their responsibility is not only for the health and well being of the animals, but also for enforcing humane and ethical treatment of the animals in the facility.\n* Large animal practice \u2013 Usually referring to veterinarians that work with, variously, [[livestock]] and other large farm animals, as well as [[Equus (genus)|equine species]] and large reptiles.\n* Equine medicine \u2013 Some veterinarians are specialists in equine medicine. Horses are different in [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[pharmacology]], and [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] to other domestic species. Specialization in [[equine]] veterinary practice is something that is normally developed after qualification, even if students do have some interest before graduation.\n* Food supply medicine \u2013 Some veterinarians deal exclusively or primarily with animals raised for food (such as [[meat]], [[milk]], and [[Egg (food)|eggs]]). Livestock practitioners may deal with [[Domestic sheep|ovine]] ([[sheep]]), [[Bovinae|bovine]] ([[cattle]]) and [[Suidae|porcine]] ([[Pig|swine]]) species; such veterinarians deal with management of [[herd]]s, [[nutrition]], [[reproduction]], and minor field surgery. [[Dairy]] medicine practice focuses on dairy animals. [[Poultry]] medicine practice focuses on the health of flocks of poultry; the field often involves extensive training in pathology, epidemiology, and nutrition of [[bird]]s. The veterinarian treats the flock and not the individual animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Reference/Pages/Food-Supply-Veterinary-Medicine-what-is-it.aspx|title=What is Food Supply Veterinary Medicine (FSVM)|date=2019|website=American Veterinary Medical Association}}</ref>\n* [[Food safety]] practice \u2013 Veterinarians are employed by both the [[food industry]] and [[government agency|government agencies]] to advise on and monitor the handling, preparation, and storage of food in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness]].\n* [[Zoological medicine|Wildlife medicine]] \u2013 A relatively recent branch of veterinary medicine, focusing on [[wildlife]]. Wildlife medicine veterinarians may work with [[Zoology|zoologists]] and conservation medicine practitioners and may also be called out to treat marine species such as [[sea otter]]s, [[dolphin]]s, or [[whale]]s after a natural disaster or [[oil spill]].\n* Aquatic medicine \u2013 mostly refers to veterinary care of fish in aquaculture (like salmon, cod, among other species), but can also include care of aquatic mammals. For certain countries with high economic income from aquaculture, this is an important part of the veterinary field (like Norway, Chile). Other countries (particularly those who are landlocked), might have little or no emphasis on aquatic medicine.\n* Dentistry \u2013 Many practices are incorporating dentistry into their daily medical services. Veterinary dentistry can extend the life of the patient by preventing oral disease and keeping the teeth and gums of the patient in healthy condition. \n\n===Veterinary specialties===\n{{Main|Veterinary specialties}}\nVeterinary specialists are in the minority compared to general practice veterinarians, and tend to be based at points of referral, such as veterinary schools or larger animal hospitals.  Unlike human medicine, veterinary specialties often combine both the surgical and medical aspects of a biological system.\n\nVeterinary specialties are accredited in North America by the AVMA through the American Board of Veterinary Specialties, in Europe by the European Board of Veterinary Specialisation and in Australasia by the Australasian Veterinary Boards Council.  While some veterinarians may have areas of interest outside of recognized specialties, they are not legally specialists.\n\nSpecialties can cover general topics such as [[anesthesiology]], [[dentistry]], and [[Veterinary surgery|surgery]], as well as organ system focus such as [[cardiology]] or [[dermatology]].  A full list can be seen at [[veterinary specialties]].\n\n=== Mobile vs Stationary Practice ===\nSome of the advantages of operating a mobile veterinary practice over a standard practice are the start-up and operating costs. Running a mobile practice is much less expensive than opening a brick and mortar location. A traditional physical location practice can cost upwards of $1,000,000 or more for equipment and surgical supplies. A mobile vet can operate as low as $3000 for a box in an SUV to around $250,000 for a fully equipped custom built chassis.<ref>Tiffany, Lynn M. \u201cMobile Vets are Driven to Succeed.\u201d  Veterinary Practice News.  09 Jun 2011.{{cite web |url=http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/June-2011/Mobile-Vets-Are-Driven-To-Succeed/ |title=Mobile Vets Are Driven to Succeed |accessdate=2016-12-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220051823/http://www.veterinarypracticenews.com/June-2011/Mobile-Vets-Are-Driven-To-Succeed/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-06-09 }}</ref> The advantages for the pet owner are less stress to their loved ones, less risk of disease transmission and convenience for having more than one pet all at close to the same cost as a clinic.

Most practice owners pay themselves based on production, including a 3\u20134% management fee plus a 4.5% \"return on investment\" fee dependent on the value of their business. In 2016, industry standards and surveys reflected that a practicing owner of a veterinary practice earned an average salary of $449,850 per year, ranging much higher based on practice production and including bonus pay and incentives. Many practice owners also own the building where the practice is based. In many cases, the owner is paid a fee for rental of the building in addition to their salary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://veterinarybusiness.dvm360.com/use-4-factors-set-veterinary-practice-owners-pay|title=Use 4 factors to set veterinary practice owners' pay|first=Mark Opperman BS|last=CVPM|website=dvm360.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506152953/http://veterinarybusiness.dvm360.com/use-4-factors-set-veterinary-practice-owners-pay|archivedate=6 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In Australia, the profession wide average income was $137,000 in 2016, and this has declined compared to other professions for the past 30 years whilst graduate unemployment has doubled between 2006 and 2011.<ref>White, Tim. \"How we make ends meet: economic sustainability of the veterinary profession\" Australian Veterinary Journal (April 2012). 18 Apr. 2012 <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-0813.2012.news_v90_i4.x/abstract>.</ref>\n\nThe financial rewards for veterinary specialists proved impressive based on information obtained in a 2017 compensation survey sent to veterinarians in the United States. Ophthalmologists and radiologists earned more than $445,468 per year. Pathologists earned more than $367,000 per year, veterinary surgeons earned more than $390,061 per year, and lab animal medicine specialists could earn more than $246,000 per year.

For instance, in North America, graduates will receive a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine or Veterinariae Medicinae Doctoris; DVM or VMD), whereas in the United Kingdom or India they would be awarded a [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science|Bachelor of Veterinary Science, Surgery or Medicine]] (BVS, BVSc, BVetMed or BVMS), and in Ireland graduates receive a Medicinae Veterinariae Baccalaureus (MVB). In continental Europe, the degree of Doctor Medicinae Veterinariae (DMV, DrMedVet, Dr. med. vet., MVDr.) or Doctor Veterinariae Medicinae (DVM, DrVetMed, Dr. vet. med.) is granted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Foreign/Pages/ECFVG-world-colleges-degrees.aspx|title=Veterinary Medical Degrees Granted Throughout the World|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>\n\nThe award of a bachelor's degree was previously commonplace in the United States, but the degree name and academic standards were upgraded to match the 'doctor' title used by graduates.\n\nComparatively few universities have [[veterinary schools]] that offer degrees which are accredited to qualify the graduates as registered vets. For example, there are 30 in the United States, 5 in Canada, and 8 in the United Kingdom (3 of which offer degrees accredited by the  [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] (AVMA)).<ref name=\"AVMA Accredited Veterinary Colleges\">{{cite web|title=Accredited Veterinary Colleges|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Accreditation/Colleges/Pages/colleges-accredited_results.aspx|website=AVMA|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217043532/https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Accreditation/Colleges/Pages/colleges-accredited_results.aspx|archivedate=17 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDue to this scarcity of places for veterinary degrees, admission to veterinary school is competitive and requires extensive preparation.  In the United States in 2007, approximately 5,750 applicants competed for the 2,650 seats in the 28 accredited [[veterinary school]]s, with an acceptance rate of 46%.<ref>Griel, Lester C. \"Advising Notes.\" Division of Undergraduate Studies. 7 Apr. 2008.

Formal experience is a particular advantage to the applicant, often consisting of work with veterinarians or scientists in clinics, agribusiness, research, or some area of health science. Less formal experience is also helpful for the applicant to have, and this includes working with animals on a farm or ranch or at a stable or animal shelter and basic overall animal exposure.<ref>Dr. Kendon, Evan B.V.Sc \"Vets And Pets\" <{{cite web |url=http://www.vetschristchurch.co.nz/christchurch-pet-vet/ |title=Christchurch Pet Vet &#124; Christchurch Mobile Vet |accessdate=2014-10-28 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028231251/http://www.vetschristchurch.co.nz/christchurch-pet-vet/ |archivedate=28 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}></ref>\n\nIn the United States, approximately 80% of admitted students are female. In the early history of veterinary medicine of the United States, most veterinarians were males. However, in the 1990s this ratio reached parity, and now it has been reversed.\n\nPreveterinary courses should emphasize the sciences. Most veterinary schools typically require applicants to have taken one year equivalent classes in [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[biology|general biology]]; and one semester of vertebrate embryology and biochemistry. Usually, the minimal mathematics requirement is college level calculus. Individual schools might require introduction to animal science, livestock judging, animal nutrition, cell biology, and genetics. However, due the limited availability of these courses, many schools have removed these requirements to widen the pool of possible applicants.\n\n===Registration and licensing===\nFollowing academic education, most countries require a vet to be registered with the relevant governing body, and to maintain this license to practice.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, veterinarians must be licensed to practice in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/veterinarians.htm#tab-4|title=Veterinarians : Occupational Outlook Handbook: : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> Licensing entails passing an accredited program, a national exam, and a state exam. For instance, in the United States, a prospective vet must receive a passing grade on a national board examination, the North America Veterinary Licensing Exam.  This exam must be completed over the course of eight hours, and consists of 360 multiple-choice questions, covering all aspects of veterinary medicine, as well as visual material designed to test diagnostic skills.\n\n===Postgraduate study===\nThe percentage electing to undertake further study following registration in the United States has increased from 36.8% to 39.9% in 2008. About 25% of those or about 9% of graduates were accepted into traditional academic internships. Approximately 9% of veterinarians eventually board certify in one of 40 distinct specialties from 22<ref>{{cite web|title=American Board of Veterinary Specialties|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/Pages/default.aspx|website=AVMA|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125259/https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> specialty organizations recognized by the AVMA American Board of Veterinary Specialties (ABVS).<ref name=\"AVMA\">{{cite web|title=Market research statistics|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/resources/statistics/pages/default.aspx/|publisher=AVMA|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006070726/https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/Statistics/Pages/default.aspx|archivedate=6 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"AVMA1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/pages/recognized-veterinary-specialty-organizations.aspx|publisher=AVMA|title=Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organizations|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501171328/http://www.avma.org/press/profession/specialties.asp|archivedate=1 May 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== ABVS Recognized Veterinary Specialties====\nSource:<ref name=\"Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organizations\">{{cite web|title=ABVS \u2013 Recognized Veterinary Specialty Organizations|url=https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/pages/Recognized-veterinary-specialty-organizations-specialtyresults.aspx?specialty=Bacteriology\\Mycology|website=AVMA.org|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=12 December 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161217050916/https://www.avma.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/Education/Specialties/pages/Recognized-veterinary-specialty-organizations-specialtyresults.aspx?specialty=Bacteriology%5CMycology|archivedate=17 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Anesthesiology and Analgesia || Animal Welfare || Avian Practice\n|-\n| Bacteriology\\Mycology || Beef Cattle Practice || Behavior\n|-\n| Canine and Feline Practice || Canine Practice || Cardiology\n|-\n| Critical Care || Dairy Practice || Dentistry\n|-\n| Dermatology || Pharmacology || Poultry\n|-\n| Radiation Oncology || Radiology || Reproductive Medicine\n|-\n| Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation || Surgery || Swine Health Management\n|-\n| Toxicology || Virology || Zoological Medicine\n|}\n\n=== Curriculum comparison with human medicine ===\nThe first two-year curriculum in both veterinary and human medical schools are very similar in course names, but in certain subjects are relatively different in content.  Considering the courses, the first two-year curriculum usually includes biochemistry, physiology, histology, anatomy, pharmacology, microbiology, epidemiology, pathology and hematology.<ref name=\"cvm.msu.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://cvm.msu.edu/student-information/dvm-program/dvm-curriculum |title=DVM Curriculum \u2014 College of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University |publisher=Cvm.msu.edu |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623234238/http://cvm.msu.edu/student-information/dvm-program/dvm-curriculum/ |archivedate=23 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSome veterinary schools use the same biochemistry, histology, and microbiology books as human medicine students; however, the course content is greatly supplemented to include the varied animal diseases and species differences. In the past, many veterinarians were trained in pharmacology using the same text books used by human physicians. As the specialty of veterinary pharmacology has developed, more schools are using pharmacology textbooks written specifically for veterinarians. Veterinary physiology, anatomy, and histology is complex, as physiology often varies among species. Microbiology and virology of animals share the same foundation as human microbiology, but with grossly different disease manifestation and presentations. Epidemiology is focused on herd health and prevention of herd borne diseases and foreign animal diseases. Pathology, like microbiology and histology, is very diverse and encompasses many species and organ systems. Most veterinary schools have courses in small animal and large animal nutrition, often taken as electives in the clinical years or as part of the core curriculum in the first two years.\n\nThe final two year curriculum is similar to that of human medicine only in clinical emphasis.<ref name=\"cvm.msu.edu\"/> A veterinary student must be well prepared to be a fully functional animal physician on the day of graduation, competent in both surgery and medicine. The graduating veterinarian must be able to pass medical board examination and be prepared to enter clinical practice on the day of graduation, while most human medical doctors in the United States complete 3 to 5 years of post-doctoral residency before practicing medicine independently, usually in a very narrow and focused specialty. Many veterinarians do also complete a post-doctoral residency, but it is not nearly as common as it is in human medicine.\n\nIn the last years, curricula in both human and veterinary medicine have been adapted with the aim of incorporating competency-based teaching.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burger |first1=C. |last2=Pirker |first2=M. |last3=Bergsmann |first3=E.M. |last4=Winter |first4=P. |editor1-last=Vettori |editor1-first=Oliver |editor2-last=Salmhofer |editor2-first=Gudrun |editor3-last=Mitterauer |editor3-first=Lukas |editor4-last=Lederm\u00fcller |editor4-first=Karl |title=Eine Frage der Wirksamkeit?

He first played for New Zealand in 1919 on the tour of Australia and became Kiwi number 122. He ended with 8 matches for New Zealand in total playing one test against Australia. He played his entire club career with the [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] club in the [[Auckland Rugby League]].\n\n==Playing career==\nIn 1914 Bill Walsh was tipped to make the Ponsonby senior team after previously having played in their second grade team, and to go on to representative honours. He was described as a \u201cfast and tricky player\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Notes and Comments\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15604\n| date = 1914-05-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140509.2.8.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-06}}</ref> Indeed, he was to debut for their senior side this year playing alongside Kiwi legend [[Thomas McClymont]]. He would go on to play for Ponsonby for 11 seasons from 1914 to 1924 which was an extraordinary period of time in that era, particularly for one club. He was part of their team which won 3 titles in [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|1917, 18 and 19]]. They were the first club to do this. He also won the Roope Rooster with Ponsonby in 1917, 1922, and 1923. In his 11 years with the Ponsonby senior team Walsh scored 17 tries and kicked 3 goals.\n\nWalsh made his representative debut for [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] in 1915 against Thames. Auckland won the match 27 to 16 at Victoria Park in front of 4,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Defeats Thames\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 16009\n| date = 30 August 1915\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150830.2.7.1\n| accessdate = 10 August 2019}}</ref> He was unfortunate, in terms of his representative career, in that his early playing years occurred during the war. [[Auckland Rugby League]] had made the decision to play little to no representative matches in this time. In the 4 years prior to the outbreak of war Auckland played 34 representative matches while during the 4 years of the war this dropped to just 8.

In 1918 Walsh played in a Thacker Shield match for Ponsonby against Sydenham in Christchurch. Ponsonby was the challenging team as Sydenham were the holders. Ponsonby won 11\u20130 to bring the trophy to Auckland where it would remain for several years until a ruling by New Zealand rugby league. They ruled that the trophy had originally been donated and intended to be played for by rugby league teams in the South Island.

He was described as a \u201cfast and tricky player\u201d.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Notes and Comments\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15604\n| date = 1914-05-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140509.2.8.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-06}}</ref> Indeed, he was to debut for their senior side this year playing alongside Kiwi legend [[Thomas McClymont]]. He would go on to play for Ponsonby for 11 seasons from 1914 to 1924 which was an extraordinary period of time in that era, particularly for one club. He was part of their team which won 3 titles in [[Auckland Rugby League club trophies|1917, 18 and 19]]. They were the first club to do this. He also won the Roope Rooster with Ponsonby in 1917, 1922, and 1923. In his 11 years with the Ponsonby senior team Walsh scored 17 tries and kicked 3 goals.\n\nWalsh made his representative debut for [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] in 1915 against Thames. Auckland won the match 27 to 16 at Victoria Park in front of 4,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Auckland Defeats Thames\n| page =4\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 16009\n| date = 30 August 1915\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150830.2.7.1\n| accessdate = 10 August 2019}}</ref> He was unfortunate, in terms of his representative career, in that his early playing years occurred during the war. [[Auckland Rugby League]] had made the decision to play little to no representative matches in this time. In the 4 years prior to the outbreak of war Auckland played 34 representative matches while during the 4 years of the war this dropped to just 8.

In 1918 Walsh played in a Thacker Shield match for Ponsonby against Sydenham in Christchurch. Ponsonby was the challenging team as Sydenham were the holders. Ponsonby won 11\u20130 to bring the trophy to Auckland where it would remain for several years until a ruling by New Zealand rugby league. They ruled that the trophy had originally been donated and intended to be played for by rugby league teams in the South Island. Walsh scored a try in the win.\n\nIn 1918 Walsh played for Auckland in a 45-9 thrashing of Canterbury at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n\nThe 1919 season was to be the most significant season for Walsh as he gained selection for the New Zealand team on their tour of Australia.

A [[Carmelite nun]], prominent [[Spanish mystic]], [[Catholic Reformation|religious reformer]], author, [[theologian]] of the contemplative life and [[mental prayer]], she earned the rare distinction of being declared a [[Doctor of the Church]] over four centuries after her death.<ref>As of 2019, there are 36 \"Doctors of the Church\", of whom only four are women.</ref> Active during the [[Catholic Reformation]], she reformed the [[Carmelite Order]]s of both women and men.<ref>Lehfeldt, E.

In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice. She was also at the centre of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the [[Protestant reformation]] sweeping over Europe and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] asserting church discipline in her home country. The consequences were to last well beyond her life. \n\nForty years after her death in 1622, Teresa was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. At the time she was considered a candidate for [[national patron saint]] of [[Spain]], but lost out to [[St. James the Apostle]]. She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain. \n\nHer written contributions, which include her autobiography, ''The Life of Teresa of Jesus'' and her seminal work ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', are today an integral part of [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. Together with ''The [[Way of Perfection]]'', her works form part of the [[literary canon]] of [[Christian mysticism]] and [[Christian meditation]] practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church. \n\nHowever, not until 27 September 1970 did [[Pope Paul VI]] proclaim Teresa the first female ''Doctor of the Church'' in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=\"vatican\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html |title=27 settembre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Teresa d'\u00c1vila Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=Vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/first_female_doctor_of_the_church_to_be_honored_this_week/|title=First female Doctor of the Church to be honored this week|website=Catholic News Agency}}</ref>\n\nOther associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence. A ''[[Santo (art)|Santero]]'' image of the [[Immaculate Conception of El Viejo]], said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to [[Peru]], was [[canonically crowned]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on December 28, 1989 at the [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception#Nicaragua|Shrine of El Viejo]] in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corazones.org/maria/america/nica_inmaculada_viejo.htm |title=Inmaculada del Viejo |work=Corazones.org |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> Another Catholic tradition holds that Saint Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], a statue she may have owned.<ref>Jansen, G., ''Life Everlasting: Catholic Devotions and Mysteries for the Everyday Seeker'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[TarcherPerigee]], 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dI0oDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248 p. 248].</ref>{{rp|248}} Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals. She continues to be widely noted as an inspiration to philosophers, theologians, historians, neurologists, fiction writers and artists, as well as to countless ordinary people interested in [[Christian spirituality]] and [[mysticism]]. \n\nSpeaking to pilgrims from Avila in October 1981, [[Pope John Paul II]] said: \"It is necessary for the rich legacy left by Teresa of Jesus to be deeply reconsidered so that it can effect a renewal of the inner life of your nation and thereby influence the renewal of life in the entire church in all its aspects. The giant figure of the Great Teresa should act as a strong encouragement in that direction not only on a local or national scale but also on a universal scale\".<ref>[[Pope John Paul II]] addressing pilgrims from Avila at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] on 8 October 1981.</ref>\n<ref>{{cite book|title=Teresa of Avila|series=Continuum Compact Series Outstanding Christian Thinkers|author=Rowan Williams|edition=reprint|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|date= 2004|isbn= 9780826473417|url=https://books.google.co.uk/booksid=mte4aBUVFiAC&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=230|access-date=2019-04-14|author-link=Rowan Williams}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Schillinger Liesl|title=The Original Flying Nun - Review of Cathleen Medwick's Teresa of Avila: The Progress of a Soul.

Her paternal grandfather, [[Juan S\u00e1nchez de Toledo]], was a [[marrano]] or [[Converso]], a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate. When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] for allegedly returning to the [[Jewish faith]], but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/teresas-marrano-grandfather |title=Teresa's 'marrano' grandfather |last=Foa |first=Anna |date=March 2, 2015 |website=Osservatore Romano |access-date=}}</ref> Her father, [[:es:Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda|Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda]], was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in \u00c1vila.

In 1536, aged 20,<ref name=SHMI>{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O.

She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially [[Francisco de Osuna|Osuna]]\u2019s ''Third Spiritual Alphabet'' (1527). Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of St. Joseph. She began to experience instances of [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen Clissold|title=St. Teresa of Avila|place=London|publisher=Sheldon|date=1982|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations of spirituality===\nHer reading of medieval mystics, consisted of directions for examinations of conscience and for spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation known in mystical nomenclature as ''oratio recollectionis'' or ''oratio mentalis''. She also dipped into other mystical [[ascetic]] works such as the ''Tractatus de oratione et meditatione'' of [[Peter of Alcantara]], and perhaps some upon which [[Ignatius of Loyola]] based his ''[[Spiritual Exercises]]''\u2014possibly the ''Spiritual Exercises'' themselves.\n\nShe reported that, during her illness, she had risen from the lowest stage, \"recollection\", to the \"devotions of silence\" or even to the \"devotions of ecstasy\", which was one of perfect union with God (see {{slink||Mysticism}}). During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced a rich \"blessing of tears\". As the Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] became clear to her, she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of [[original sin]]. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the necessity of absolute subjection to [[God]].\n\nAround the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of [[St. Augustine]]'s autobiographical work '[[Confessions]]', which helped her resolve and tend to her own bouts of scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and found solace in how such a great saint was once a sinner. In her Autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St. Augustine...for he was a sinner too.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Jesus |first1=Teresa |title=The Autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila: the Life of St. Teresa of Jesus |date=1997 |publisher=Tan Books and Publishers, Inc. |isbn=9780895556035}}</ref>\n\nAround 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge was diabolical, not divine. She had begun to inflict [[mortification of the flesh|mortifications of the flesh]] upon herself. But her [[confession (sacrament)|confessor]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Borgia]], reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On [[St. Peter's Day]] in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterrupted for more than two years. In another vision, a [[seraph]] drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:\n\n{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...}}<ref>Teresa wrote that it must be a [[cherub]] (''Deben ser los que llaman cherubines'')<!--sic-->, but Fr. Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez wrote in the margin that it seemed more like a seraph (''mas parece de los que se llaman seraphis''),<!--sic--> an identification that most editors have followed. {{cite book |author=Santa Teresa de \u00c1vila |title=Escritos de Santa Teresa |chapter=''Libro de su vida''}}</ref>\n\nThis vision was the inspiration for one of [[Bernini]]'s most famous works, the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' at [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome.\n\nThe memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\n\n===Embarrassment of raptures===\nTeresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures which sometimes involved [[levitation]]. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians and  neurologists and psychiatrists like, [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] and Javier Alvarez-Rodriguez among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life, means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th-century has been preserved. Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Marcella Biro Barton (1982), \u201cSaint Teresa of Avila: Did she have Epilepsy?\u201d, ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]''.

Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of [[cloister]], designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocd.pcn.net/hista.htm#The |title=HISTORY - discalced carmelite order - Contemplative Discalced Carmelite Nuns |website=Pcn.net |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Peter of Alcantara]], who met her early in 1560 and became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual adviser]]. She resolved to found a \"reformed\" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.\n\nThe abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named [[Convento de San Jos\u00e9 (\u00c1vila)|St. Joseph's (San Jos\u00e9)]], at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of \u00c1vila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.\n\nIn March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received [[Papal decree|papal sanction]] for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a \"constitution\". Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial [[flagellation]] prescribed for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every week, and the [[discalceation]] of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.\n\n[[File:TeresaAvila.jpg|left|thumb|Church window at the [[Iglesia-convento de Santa Teresa|Convent of St Teresa]]]]\n\n===Extended travels===\nIn 1567, Teresa received a [[letters patent|patent]] from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new [[Religious order|order]]. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her ''Libro de las Fundaciones''. Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at [[Medina del Campo]], [[Malag\u00f3n]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Salamanca]], and [[Alba de Tormes]].\n\nAs part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for [[Friar|men]] who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, [[John of the Cross]] and Father Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at [[Duruelo]]. Another friend of Teresa, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Graci\u00e1n]], the [[Carmelite visitator]] of the older observance of [[Andalusia]] and apostolic commissioner, and later [[Provincial superior|provincial]] of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at [[Segovia]] (1571), [[Beas de Segura]] (1574), [[Seville]] (1575), and [[Caravaca de la Cruz]] ([[Murcia]], 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh|first=Kieran|title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross|year=1991|publisher=ICS Publications|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-935216-14-1|chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch|pages=9\u201327|editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to reforms===\nIn 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the [[general chapter]] at [[Piacenza]], the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into \"voluntary\" retirement at one of her institutions.{{r|Kavanaugh}} She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo.

As a result, in 1579, the cases before the [[inquisition]] against her, Father Gracian and others, were dropped.<ref name=Kavanaugh/> This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a \"protective\" board of four assessors for the reform.{{r|Kavanaugh}}\n\nDuring the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at [[Villanueva de la Jara]] in northern [[Andalusia]] (1580), [[Palencia]] (1580), [[Soria]] (1581), [[Burgos]], and [[Granada]] (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries were owed to her reforms over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/3898/Final%20Draft.pdf |title=The Compassionate Mother of Carmel: Teresa of Avila and the Carmelite Model for Twenty-First-Century Seekers |last=Salamony |first=Ryan |date=2017 |website=Goucher College Repository}}</ref>\n\n==Last days==\nHer final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as [[Catholic Europe]] was making the switch from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which required the excision of the dates of 5\u201314 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case. Her last words were: \"My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done. O my Lord and my Spouse, the hour that I have longed for has come. It is time to meet one another.\"<ref>''2000 Years of Prayer'' by Michael Counsell (2004) {{ISBN|978-1-853-11623-0}}, p. 207.</ref>[[File:Avila SaintTheresa1.jpg|thumb|right|[[\u00c1vila, Spain|Avila]], Saint Theresa's statue|279x279px]]\n===Holy relics===\nShe was buried at the Convento de la Anunciaci\u00f3n in [[Alba de Tormes]]. Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be [[Incorruptibility|intact]] but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to \u00c1vila. Father Graci\u00e1n cut the little finger off the hand and - according to his own account - kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying [[Ottoman Turk]]s, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to \u00c1vila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in \u00c1vila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with [[Pope Sixtus V]] ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.\n\nThe body still remains there, apart from the following parts:\n* Rome - right foot and part of the upper jaw\n* [[Lisbon]] - left hand\n* [[Ronda]], Spain - left eye and right hand (the latter was kept by [[Francisco Franco]] until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes - left arm and heart\n* Church of Our Lady of Loreto, [[Paris]], France - one finger\n* [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] - one finger\n\n[[File:Ecstasy of Saint Teresa September 2015-2a.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' by [[Bernini]], Basilica of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]]|alt=|left|353x353px]]\n\n==Canonization==\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. The [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] exalted her to [[patron saint|patroness]] of Spain in 1627. The [[University of Salamanca]] had granted her the title ''[[Doctor ecclesiae]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"Doctor of the Church\") with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of [[Doctor of the Church]], which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 27 September 1970,<ref name=vatican/> along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19701003.html |title=3 ottobre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Caterina da Siena Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=w2.vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer. The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as [[Francis of Sales]], [[F\u00e9nelon]], and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royalists]]. In 1670 her coffin was plated in silver.\n\n[[File:Palau de Mafra - Est\u00e0tua - 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila in [[Mafra National Palace]], [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]]]\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to God in four stages (see: ''The Autobiography'' Chs. 10-22):\n\n* The first, ''Devotion of the Heart'', consists of [[mental prayer]] and [[Contemplation (Christianity)|contemplation]]. It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, [[penitence]] and especially the devout [[Meditations on the Life of Christ|meditation]] on the passion of Christ (''Autobiography'' 11.20).\n\n* The second, ''Devotion of Peace'', is where human will is surrendered to God. This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction. Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (''Autobiography'' 14.1).\n\n* The third, ''Devotion of Union'', concerns the absorption-in-God. It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state. At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble. This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the ''higher soul faculties'', that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.\n\n* The fourth, ''Devotion of Ecstasy'', is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears. Sensory faculties cease to operate. Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated. Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation. Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space.<ref name=\"Clissold\">{{cite book|author=Clissold Stephen|title=St Teresa of Avila|publisher=Sheldon Press|place=London|date=1982|pages=63\u201364|isbn = 0-85969-347-3}}</ref> This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God. The subject awakens from this trance state in tears. it may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience. Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on more than one occasion.{{r|Clissold}}\n\nTeresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique. Her writings on this theme, stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts. Her definitions have been used in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Teresa states: \"Contemplative prayer (''oraci\u00f3n mental)'', in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends. It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |date=1997 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm#2709}}</ref> Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Teresa de Jes\u00fas.jpg|thumb|upright|This is the one portrait of Teresa that is probably the most true to her appearance.

It led eventually to the establishment of the [[Discalced Carmelites]]. A formal papal decree adopting the split was issued in 1580.<ref>\"Teresa of Avila (1515\u20131582).\" Encyclopedia of European Social History.

In her mature years, she became the central figure of a movement of spiritual and monastic renewal borne out of an inner conviction and honed by [[Asceticism|ascetic]] practice. She was also at the centre of deep ecclesiastical controversy as she took on the pervasive laxity in her order against the background of the [[Protestant reformation]] sweeping over Europe and the [[Spanish Inquisition]] asserting church discipline in her home country. The consequences were to last well beyond her life. \n\nForty years after her death in 1622, Teresa was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. At the time she was considered a candidate for [[national patron saint]] of [[Spain]], but lost out to [[St. James the Apostle]]. She has since become one of the patron saints of Spain. \n\nHer written contributions, which include her autobiography, ''The Life of Teresa of Jesus'' and her seminal work ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', are today an integral part of [[Spanish Renaissance literature]]. Together with ''The [[Way of Perfection]]'', her works form part of the [[literary canon]] of [[Christian mysticism]] and [[Christian meditation]] practice, and continue to attract interest from people both within and outside the Catholic Church. \n\nHowever, not until 27 September 1970 did [[Pope Paul VI]] proclaim Teresa the first female ''Doctor of the Church'' in recognition of her centuries-long spiritual legacy to [[Catholicism]].<ref name=\"vatican\">{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19700927_it.html |title=27 settembre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Teresa d'\u00c1vila Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=Vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/first_female_doctor_of_the_church_to_be_honored_this_week/|title=First female Doctor of the Church to be honored this week|website=Catholic News Agency}}</ref>\n\nOther associations with Teresa beyond her writings continue to exert a wide influence. A ''[[Santo (art)|Santero]]'' image of the [[Immaculate Conception of El Viejo]], said to have been sent by her with a brother emigrating to [[Peru]], was [[canonically crowned]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on December 28, 1989 at the [[Patronages of the Immaculate Conception#Nicaragua|Shrine of El Viejo]] in [[Nicaragua]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corazones.org/maria/america/nica_inmaculada_viejo.htm |title=Inmaculada del Viejo |work=Corazones.org |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> Another Catholic tradition holds that Saint Teresa is personally associated with devotion to the [[Infant Jesus of Prague]], a statue she may have owned.<ref>Jansen, G., ''Life Everlasting: Catholic Devotions and Mysteries for the Everyday Seeker'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[TarcherPerigee]], 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dI0oDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA248 p. 248].</ref>{{rp|248}} Since her death, her reputation has grown, leading to multiple portrayals.

Her paternal grandfather, [[Juan S\u00e1nchez de Toledo]], was a [[marrano]] or [[Converso]], a Jew forced to convert to Christianity or emigrate. When Teresa's father was a child, Juan was condemned by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] for allegedly returning to the [[Jewish faith]], but he was later able to assume a Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osservatoreromano.va/en/news/teresas-marrano-grandfather |title=Teresa's 'marrano' grandfather |last=Foa |first=Anna |date=March 2, 2015 |website=Osservatore Romano |access-date=}}</ref> Her father, [[:es:Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda|Alonso S\u00e1nchez de Cepeda]], was a successful wool merchant and one of the wealthiest men in \u00c1vila.

Teresa was fascinated by accounts of the lives of the saints and ran away from home at age seven with her brother Rodrigo to find [[martyrdom]] among [[the Moors]].

In 1536, aged 20,<ref name=SHMI>{{cite book|author=Fr. Paolo O.

She took up religious reading on contemplative prayer, especially [[Francisco de Osuna|Osuna]]\u2019s ''Third Spiritual Alphabet'' (1527). Her zeal for mortification caused her to become ill again and she spent almost a year in bed, causing huge worry to her community and family. She nearly died but she recovered, attributing her recovery to the miraculous intercession of St. Joseph. She began to experience instances of [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen Clissold|title=St. Teresa of Avila|place=London|publisher=Sheldon|date=1982|edition=2}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations of spirituality===\nHer reading of medieval mystics, consisted of directions for examinations of conscience and for spiritual self-concentration and inner contemplation known in mystical nomenclature as ''oratio recollectionis'' or ''oratio mentalis''. She also dipped into other mystical [[ascetic]] works such as the ''Tractatus de oratione et meditatione'' of [[Peter of Alcantara]], and perhaps some upon which [[Ignatius of Loyola]] based his ''[[Spiritual Exercises]]''\u2014possibly the ''Spiritual Exercises'' themselves.\n\nShe reported that, during her illness, she had risen from the lowest stage, \"recollection\", to the \"devotions of silence\" or even to the \"devotions of ecstasy\", which was one of perfect union with God (see {{slink||Mysticism}}). During this final stage, she said she frequently experienced a rich \"blessing of tears\". As the Catholic distinction between [[mortal sin|mortal]] and [[venial sin]] became clear to her, she came to understand the awful terror of sin and the inherent nature of [[original sin]]. She also became conscious of her own natural impotence in confronting sin and the necessity of absolute subjection to [[God]].\n\nAround the same time, she received a copy of the full Spanish translation of [[St. Augustine]]'s autobiographical work '[[Confessiones]]', which helped her resolve and tend to her own bouts of scruples. The text helped her realize that holiness was indeed possible and found solace in how such a great saint was once a sinner. In her Autobiography, she wrote that she 'was very fond of St. Augustine...for he was a sinner too.'<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Jesus |first1=Teresa |title=The Autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila: the Life of St. Teresa of Jesus |date=1997 |publisher=Tan Books and Publishers, Inc. |isbn=9780895556035}}</ref>\n\nAround 1556, friends suggested that her newfound knowledge was diabolical, not divine. She had begun to inflict [[mortification of the flesh|mortifications of the flesh]] upon herself. But her [[confession (sacrament)|confessor]], the [[Jesuit]] [[Francis Borgia]], reassured her of the divine inspiration of her thoughts. On [[St. Peter's Day]] in 1559, Teresa became firmly convinced that Jesus Christ presented Himself to her in bodily form, though invisible. These visions lasted almost uninterrupted for more than two years. In another vision, a [[seraph]] drove the fiery point of a golden lance repeatedly through her heart, causing an ineffable spiritual and bodily pain:\n\n{{quote|I saw in his hand a long spear of gold, and at the point there seemed to be a little fire. He appeared to me to be thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...}}<ref>Teresa wrote that it must be a [[cherub]] (''Deben ser los que llaman cherubines'')<!--sic-->, but Fr. Domingo B\u00e1\u00f1ez wrote in the margin that it seemed more like a seraph (''mas parece de los que se llaman seraphis''),<!--sic--> an identification that most editors have followed. {{cite book |author=Santa Teresa de \u00c1vila |title=Escritos de Santa Teresa |chapter=''Libro de su vida''}}</ref>\n\nThis vision was the inspiration for one of [[Bernini]]'s most famous works, the ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' at [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome|Santa Maria della Vittoria]] in Rome.\n\nThe memory of this episode served as an inspiration throughout the rest of her life, and motivated her lifelong imitation of the life and suffering of Jesus, epitomized in the adage often associated with her: \"Lord, either let me suffer or let me die.\"\n\n===Embarrassment of raptures===\nTeresa, who became a celebrity in her town dispensing wisdom from behind the convent grille, was also known for her raptures which sometimes involved [[levitation]]. It was a source of embarrassment to her and she bade her sisters hold her down when this occurred. Subsequently, historians and  neurologists and psychiatrists like, [[Peter Fenwick (neuropsychologist)|Peter Fenwick]] and Javier Alvarez-Rodriguez among others, have taken an interest in her symptomatology. The fact that she wrote down virtually everything that happened to her during her religious life, means that an invaluable and exceedingly rare medical record from the 16th-century has been preserved. Examination of this record has led to the speculative conclusion that she may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Marcella Biro Barton (1982), \u201cSaint Teresa of Avila: Did she have Epilepsy?\u201d, ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]''.

Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of [[cloister]], designed to protect and strengthen spiritual practice and prayer, became so lax that it appeared to lose its purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, disturbed the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vacuous conversation. Such intrusions in the solitude essential to develop and sustain contemplative prayer so grieved Teresa that she longed to intervene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ocd.pcn.net/hista.htm#The |title=HISTORY - discalced carmelite order - Contemplative Discalced Carmelite Nuns |website=Pcn.net |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe incentive to take the practical steps inspired by her inward motivation was supported by the [[Franciscan]] priest, [[Peter of Alcantara]], who met her early in 1560 and became her [[Spiritual direction|spiritual adviser]]. She resolved to found a \"reformed\" Carmelite convent, correcting the laxity which she had found at the Incarnation convent and elsewhere besides. Guimara de Ulloa, a woman of wealth and a friend, supplied the funds for the project.\n\nThe abject poverty of the new convent, established in 1562 and named [[Convento de San Jos\u00e9 (\u00c1vila)|St. Joseph's (San Jos\u00e9)]], at first caused a scandal among the citizens and authorities of \u00c1vila, and the small house with its chapel was in peril of suppression. However, powerful patrons, including the local bishop, coupled with the impression of well ordered subsistence and purpose, turned animosity into approval.\n\nIn March 1563, after Teresa had moved to the new convent house, she received [[Papal decree|papal sanction]] for her primary principles of absolute poverty and renunciation of ownership of property, which she proceeded to formulate into a \"constitution\". Her plan was the revival of the earlier, stricter monastic rules, supplemented by new regulations including the three disciplines of ceremonial [[flagellation]] prescribed for the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] every week, and the [[discalceation]] of the religious. For the first five years, Teresa remained in seclusion, mostly engaged in prayer and writing.\n\n[[File:TeresaAvila.jpg|left|thumb|Church window at the [[Iglesia-convento de Santa Teresa|Convent of St Teresa]]]]\n\n===Extended travels===\nIn 1567, Teresa received a [[letters patent|patent]] from the Carmelite General, Rubeo de Ravenna, to establish further houses of the new [[Religious order|order]]. This process required many visitations and long journeys across nearly all the provinces of Spain. She left a record of the arduous project in her ''Libro de las Fundaciones''. Between 1567 and 1571, reformed convents were established at [[Medina del Campo]], [[Malag\u00f3n]], [[Valladolid]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Pastrana, Spain|Pastrana]], [[Salamanca]], and [[Alba de Tormes]].\n\nAs part of the original patent, Teresa was given permission to set up two houses for [[Friar|men]] who wished to adopt the reforms. She convinced two Carmelite friars, [[John of the Cross]] and Father Anthony of Jesus to help with this. They founded the first monastery of Discalced Carmelite brothers in November 1568 at [[Duruelo]]. Another friend of Teresa, [[Jer\u00f3nimo Graci\u00e1n]], the [[Carmelite visitator]] of the older observance of [[Andalusia]] and apostolic commissioner, and later [[Provincial superior|provincial]] of the Teresian order, gave her powerful support in founding monasteries at [[Segovia]] (1571), [[Beas de Segura]] (1574), [[Seville]] (1575), and [[Caravaca de la Cruz]] ([[Murcia]], 1576). Meanwhile, John of the Cross promoted the inner life of the movement through his power as a teacher and preacher.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh|first=Kieran|title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross|year=1991|publisher=ICS Publications|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-935216-14-1|chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch|pages=9\u201327|editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\n===Opposition to reforms===\nIn 1576, unreformed members of the Carmelite order began to persecute Teresa, her supporters and her reforms. Following a number of resolutions adopted at the [[general chapter]] at [[Piacenza]], the governing body of the order forbade all further founding of reformed convents. The general chapter instructed her to go into \"voluntary\" retirement at one of her institutions.{{r|Kavanaugh}} She obeyed and chose St. Joseph's at Toledo. Meanwhile, her friends and associates were subjected to further attacks.<ref name=Kavanaugh>{{cite book |last=Kavanaugh |first=Kieran |title=The Collected Works of St John of the Cross |year=1991 |publisher=ICS Publications |location=Washington |isbn=978-0-935216-14-1 |chapter=General Introduction: Biographical Sketch |pages=9\u201327 |editor=Kieran Kavanaugh}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years later, her appeals by letter to King [[Philip II of Spain]] secured relief. As a result, in 1579, the cases before the [[inquisition]] against her, Father Gracian and others, were dropped.<ref name=Kavanaugh/> This allowed the reform to resume. An edict from [[Pope Gregory XIII]] allowed the appointment of a special provincial for the newer branch of the Carmelite religious, and a royal decree created a \"protective\" board of four assessors for the reform.{{r|Kavanaugh}}\n\nDuring the last three years of her life, Teresa founded convents at [[Villanueva de la Jara]] in northern [[Andalusia]] (1580), [[Palencia]] (1580), [[Soria]] (1581), [[Burgos]], and [[Granada]] (1582). In total, seventeen convents, all but one founded by her, and as many men's monasteries were owed to her reforms over twenty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mdsoar.org/bitstream/handle/11603/3898/Final%20Draft.pdf |title=The Compassionate Mother of Carmel: Teresa of Avila and the Carmelite Model for Twenty-First-Century Seekers |last=Salamony |first=Ryan |date=2017 |website=Goucher College Repository}}</ref>\n\n==Last days==\nHer final illness overtook her on one of her journeys from Burgos to Alba de Tormes. She died in 1582, just as [[Catholic Europe]] was making the switch from the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] to the [[Gregorian calendar]], which required the excision of the dates of 5\u201314 October from the calendar. She died either before midnight of 4 October or early in the morning of 15 October which is celebrated as her feast day. According to the liturgical calendar then in use, she died on the 15th in any case. Her last words were: \"My Lord, it is time to move on. Well then, may your will be done.

Nine months after her death the coffin was opened and her body was found to be [[Incorruptibility|intact]] but the clothing had rotted. Before the body was re-interred one of her hands was cut off, wrapped in a scarf and sent to \u00c1vila. Father Graci\u00e1n cut the little finger off the hand and - according to his own account - kept it with him until it was taken by the occupying [[Ottoman Turk]]s, from whom he had to redeem it with a few rings and 20 reales. The body was exhumed again on 25 November 1585 to be moved to \u00c1vila and found to be incorrupt. An arm was removed and left in Alba de Tormes at the nuns' request, to compensate for losing the main relic of Teresa, but the rest of the body was reburied in the Discalced Carmelite chapter house in \u00c1vila. The removal was done without the approval of the Duke of Alba de Tormes and he brought the body back in 1586, with [[Pope Sixtus V]] ordering that it remain in Alba de Tormes on pain of excommunication. A grander tomb on the original site was raised in 1598 and the body was moved to a new chapel in 1616.\n\nThe body still remains there, apart from the following parts:\n* Rome - right foot and part of the upper jaw\n* [[Lisbon]] - left hand\n* [[Ronda]], Spain - left eye and right hand (the latter was kept by [[Francisco Franco]] until his death after Francoist troops captured it from Republican troops during the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* Museum of the Church of the Annunciation, Alba de Tormes - left arm and heart\n* Church of Our Lady of Loreto, [[Paris]], France - one finger\n* [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]] - one finger\n\n[[File:Ecstasy of Saint Teresa September 2015-2a.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]]'' by [[Bernini]], Basilica of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome]]|alt=|left|353x353px]]\n\n==Canonization==\nIn 1622, forty years after her death, she was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Gregory XV]]. The [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] exalted her to [[patron saint|patroness]] of Spain in 1627. The [[University of Salamanca]] had granted her the title ''[[Doctor ecclesiae]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"Doctor of the Church\") with a diploma in her lifetime but that title is distinct from the papal honour of [[Doctor of the Church]], which is always conferred posthumously. The latter was finally bestowed upon her by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 27 September 1970,<ref name=vatican/> along with [[Saint Catherine of Siena]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/it/homilies/1970/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19701003.html |title=3 ottobre 1970: Proclamazione di Santa Caterina da Siena Dottore della Chiesa - Paolo VI |website=w2.vatican.va |accessdate=13 October 2017}}</ref> making them the first women to be awarded the distinction. Teresa is revered as the Doctor of Prayer. The mysticism in her works exerted a formative influence upon many theologians of the following centuries, such as [[Francis of Sales]], [[F\u00e9nelon]], and the [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royalists]]. In 1670 her coffin was plated in silver.\n\n[[File:Palau de Mafra - Est\u00e0tua - 1.jpg|thumb|Statue of Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila in [[Mafra National Palace]], [[Mafra, Portugal|Mafra]]]]\n\n==Mysticism==\nThe ultimate preoccupation of Teresa's mystical thought, as consistently reflected in her writings, is the ascent of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] to God in four stages (see: ''The Autobiography'' Chs. 10-22):\n\n* The first, ''Devotion of the Heart'', consists of [[mental prayer]] and [[Contemplation (Christianity)|contemplation]]. It means the withdrawal of the soul from without, [[penitence]] and especially the devout [[Meditations on the Life of Christ|meditation]] on the passion of Christ (''Autobiography'' 11.20).\n\n* The second, ''Devotion of Peace'', is where human will is surrendered to God. This occurs by virtue of an uplifted awareness granted by God, while other faculties, such as memory, reason, and imagination, are not yet safe from worldly distraction. Although a partial distraction can happen, due to outer activity such as repetition of prayers or writing down spiritual things, the prevailing state is one of quietude (''Autobiography'' 14.1).\n\n* The third, ''Devotion of Union'', concerns the absorption-in-God. It is not only a heightened, but essentially, an [[religious ecstasy|ecstatic]] state. At this level, reason is also surrendered to God, and only the memory and imagination are left to ramble. This state is characterized by a blissful peace, a sweet slumber of at least the ''higher soul faculties'', that is a consciousness of being enraptured by the love of God.\n\n* The fourth, ''Devotion of Ecstasy'', is where the consciousness of being in the body disappears. Sensory faculties cease to operate. Memory and imagination also become absorbed in God, as though intoxicated. Body and spirit dwell in the throes of exquisite pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, in complete unconscious helplessness, and periods of apparent strangulation. Sometimes such ecstatic transports literally cause the body to be lifted into space.<ref name=\"Clissold\">{{cite book|author=Clissold Stephen|title=St Teresa of Avila|publisher=Sheldon Press|place=London|date=1982|pages=63\u201364|isbn = 0-85969-347-3}}</ref> This state may last as long as half an hour and tends to be followed by relaxation of a few hours of swoon-like weakness, attended by the absence of all faculties while in union with God. The subject awakens from this trance state in tears. it may be regarded as the culmination of mystical experience. Indeed, Teresa was said to have been observed [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]] during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on more than one occasion.{{r|Clissold}}\n\nTeresa is regarded as one of the foremost writers on mental prayer, and her position among writers on mystical theology as unique. Her writings on this theme, stem from her personal experiences, thereby manifesting considerable insight and analytical gifts. Her definitions have been used in the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. Teresa states: \"Contemplative prayer (''oraci\u00f3n mental)'', in my opinion is nothing other than a close sharing between friends. It means frequently taking time to be alone with Him whom we know loves us.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |date=1997 |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm#2709}}</ref> Throughout her writings, Teresa returns to the image of watering one's garden as a metaphor for mystical prayer.\n\n==Writings==\n[[File:Teresa de Jes\u00fas.jpg|thumb|upright|This is the one portrait of Teresa that is probably the most true to her appearance.

This category of games requires multiple machines to connect via the Internet; before the Internet became popular, MUDs were played on time-sharing computer systems and games like ''Doom'' were played on a LAN.\n\nGamers refer to [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] using the term \"[[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]\", after a utility which measures round-trip network communication delays (by the use of [[Internet Control Message Protocol|ICMP]] packets). A player on a [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] connection with a 50-[[Millisecond|ms]] ping can react faster than a modem user with a 350-ms average latency. Other problems include [[packet loss]] and choke, which can prevent a player from \"registering\" their actions with a server. In first-person shooters, this problem appears when bullets hit the enemy without damage. The player's connection is not the only factor; some servers are slower than others.\n\nBeginning with the [[Sega NetLink]] in 1996, [[Game.com]] in 1997 and [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, game consoles support network gaming over LANs and the Internet. Many [[mobile phone]]s and [[handheld console]]s also offer wireless gaming with [[Bluetooth]] (or similar) technology. By the early 2010s online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Single-system==\nIn modern [[console game|console]], [[arcade game|arcade]] and [[personal computer game]]s, \"multiplayer\" implies play with several controllers plugged into one game system. Home-console games often use [[split screen (video games)|split screen]], so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in [[racing video game]]s); most arcade games, and some console games (since ''Pong''), do not. Nearly all multiplayer modes on [[beat 'em up]] games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode. Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.\n\nThe term \"local co-op\" refers to local multiplayer games played in a cooperative manner on the same system; these may use split-screen or some other display method.\n\n[[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|Hotseat games]] are typically turn-based games with only one controller or input set - such as a single keyboard/mouse on the system. Players rotate using the input device to perform their turn such that each is taking a turn on the \"hotseat\".\n\n==Asymmetrical gameplay==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}} <!-- There are a list of references at WP:Articles_for_deletion/Aysmmetric_Video_Game -->\nAn asymmetric video game is a type of multiplayer video game in which players may play on in an unbalanced way. In \"soft asymmetry\" games the players have the same basic mechanics such as movement and death, yet all have different roles. In \"strong asymmetry\" games typically have one team that are practically the same or in soft asymmetric roles while the other team features players that play in a drastically different way.\n\n==Online cheating==\n{{main|Cheating in online games}}\nOnline cheating (in gaming) usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others such as [[Aimbot]] in shooting games.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cheating|title=Cheating|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2007/04/gamesfrontiers_0423|title=What Type of Game Cheater Are You?|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=2009-09-15|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3149/how_to_hurt_the_hackers_the_scoop_.php|title=How To Hurt The Hackers|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref> This is also known as \"hacking\" or \"glitching\". Cheating in video games is often done via a third party program which modifies the game's code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage. In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the games files to change the game's mechanics.<ref>Carter, M. & Gibbs, M.

Other problems include [[packet loss]] and choke, which can prevent a player from \"registering\" their actions with a server. In first-person shooters, this problem appears when bullets hit the enemy without damage. The player's connection is not the only factor; some servers are slower than others.\n\nBeginning with the [[Sega NetLink]] in 1996, [[Game.com]] in 1997 and [[Dreamcast]] in 2000, game consoles support network gaming over LANs and the Internet. Many [[mobile phone]]s and [[handheld console]]s also offer wireless gaming with [[Bluetooth]] (or similar) technology. By the early 2010s online gaming had become a mainstay of console platforms such as [[Xbox]] and [[PlayStation]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n==Single-system==\nIn modern [[console game|console]], [[arcade game|arcade]] and [[personal computer game]]s, \"multiplayer\" implies play with several controllers plugged into one game system. Home-console games often use [[split screen (video games)|split screen]], so each player has an individual view of the action (important in first-person shooters and in [[racing video game]]s); most arcade games, and some console games (since ''Pong''), do not. Nearly all multiplayer modes on [[beat 'em up]] games have a single-system option, but racing games have started to abandon split screen in favor of a multiple-system, multiplayer mode. Turn-based games such as chess also lend themselves to single system single screen and even to a single controller.\n\nThe term \"local co-op\" refers to local multiplayer games played in a cooperative manner on the same system; these may use split-screen or some other display method.\n\n[[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|Hotseat games]] are typically turn-based games with only one controller or input set - such as a single keyboard/mouse on the system. Players rotate using the input device to perform their turn such that each is taking a turn on the \"hotseat\".\n\n==Asymmetrical gameplay==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}} <!-- There are a list of references at WP:Articles_for_deletion/Aysmmetric_Video_Game -->\nAn asymmetric video game is a type of multiplayer video game in which players may play on in an unbalanced way. In \"soft asymmetry\" games the players have the same basic mechanics such as movement and death, yet all have different roles. In \"strong asymmetry\" games typically have one team that are practically the same or in soft asymmetric roles while the other team features players that play in a drastically different way.\n\n==Online cheating==\n{{main|Cheating in online games}}\nOnline cheating (in gaming) usually refers to modifying the game experience to give one player an advantage over others such as [[Aimbot]] in shooting games.<ref>{{cite dictionary|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cheating|title=Cheating|dictionary=Dictionary.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.com/gaming/virtualworlds/commentary/games/2007/04/gamesfrontiers_0423|title=What Type of Game Cheater Are You?|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=December 19, 2012|accessdate=2009-09-15|magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired.com]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3149/how_to_hurt_the_hackers_the_scoop_.php|title=How To Hurt The Hackers|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref> This is also known as \"hacking\" or \"glitching\". Cheating in video games is often done via a third party program which modifies the game's code at runtime to give one or more players an advantage. In other situations, it is frequently done by changing the games files to change the game's mechanics.<ref>Carter, M. & Gibbs, M.

At the end of the second decade of the 20th century there were about 3,000 Estonians in Argentina.\n\nToday, about 1,500 Estonians reside in Argentina, who are mostly interested in the development of relations between Estonia and Argentina. In 2006, to meet the needs of Estonians living in Argentina, a consular mission was organised in Buenos Aires. During the mission, the consul of Estonia who resides in [[New York City]] held various consular services for local Estonians.\n\nThe Estonian community in Buenos Aires consists of about 50 families with Estonian roots. Unfortunately, members of the younger generations have only a small knowledge of the [[Estonian language]] due to the preference for the [[Spanish language]] as their [[mother tongue]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.vm.ee/?q=en%2Fnode%2F99 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221182305/http://www.vm.ee/?q=en%2Fnode%2F99 |archive-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Religion ==\n[[File:Estonians in Argentina (2422066417).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Estonian Argentines with diplomats from Estonia.]]\n\n=== Lutheran Church ===\nEstonians, like other immigrants from Europe (as the [[German Argentine|Germans]], [[Danes]], [[Norwegians]],[[Swedish Argentine|Swedes]], [[Finnish Argentine|Finns]], [[Latvians]], etc.) brought with them to Argentina their [[Lutheranism|Lutheran religion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/catherinemblack/docs/elsol_29?mode=window&pageNumber=1|title=El Sol de San Telmo #29|website=Issuu.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120111122936/http://www.luteranasanpablo.com.ar/quienes.html] </ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://iluterana.cl/index/?page_id=281 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221223704/http://iluterana.cl/index/?page_id=281 |archive-date=2014-02-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Estonian community led to the Evangelical Lutheran Congregation \"''The Reformation''\" ({{lang-es|La Reforma}}) over 55 years ago.
