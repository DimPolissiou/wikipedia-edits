In the case of DOS, it is the default user interface as well. It has an additional role as the usual first program run after boot (root process), hence being responsible for setting up the system by running the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] configuration file, and being the ancestor of all processes.\n\nCOMMAND.COM's successor on [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]] systems is [[cmd.exe]], although COMMAND.COM is available in [[virtual DOS machine]]s on [[IA-32]] versions of those operating systems as well.\n\nThe {{Mono|COMMAND.COM}} filename was also used by {{ill|Disk Control Program|de}} (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East German [[VEB Robotron]].<ref name=\"DCP_2016\"/>\n\nThe compatible command processor under [[FreeDOS]] is sometimes also named [[FreeCom]].\n\nCOMMAND.COM is a DOS program. Programs launched from COMMAND.COM are DOS programs that use the [[DOS API]] to communicate with the disk operating system.\n\n==Operating modes==\nAs a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation. The first is [[Read-eval-print loop|interactive mode]], in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is [[Batch processing|batch mode]], which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the [[Batch file|.BAT]] extension.\n\n=={{anchor|Prompt}}Internal commands==\nInternal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary. Thus, they are always available but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.\n\nAll commands are executed after the {{keypress|Enter}} key is pressed at the end of the line. COMMAND.COM is not case-sensitive, meaning commands can be typed in any mixture of upper and lower case.\n\n; [[BREAK (DOS command)|BREAK]]: Controls the handling of program interruption with {{keypress|Ctrl|C}} or {{keypress|Ctrl|Break}}.\n; [[CHCP (command)|CHCP]]: Displays or changes the current system [[code page]].\n; [[CHDIR|CHDIR, CD]]: Changes the current [[working directory]] or displays the current directory.\n; [[CLS (DOS command)|CLS]]: Clears the screen.\n; [[COPY (DOS command)|COPY]]: Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also [[XCOPY]], an external command that could also copy directory trees).\n; [[CTTY (DOS command)|CTTY]]: Defines the device to use for input and output.\n; [[DATE (command)|DATE]]: Display and set the date of the system.\n; [[DEL (command)|DEL, ERASE]]: Deletes a file. When used on a directory, deletes all files inside the directory only. In comparison, the external command [[DELTREE]] deletes all subdirectories and files inside a directory as well as the directory itself.\n; [[DIR (command)|DIR]]: Lists the files in the specified directory.\n; [[ECHO (command)|ECHO]]: Toggles whether text is displayed ({{codett|ECHO ON}}) or not ({{codett|ECHO OFF}}). Also displays text on the screen ({{codett|ECHO text}}).\n; [[EXIT (command)|EXIT]]: Exits from COMMAND.COM and returns to the program which launched it.\n; [[LFNFOR]]: Enables or disables the return of [[long filename]]s by the FOR command. ([[Windows 9x]]).\n; [[LOADHIGH|LOADHIGH, LH]]: Loads a program into [[Upper Memory Area|upper memory]] ({{codett|HILOAD}} in [[DR DOS]]).\n; [[LOCK (DOS command)|LOCK]]: Enables external programs to perform low-level disk access to a volume. ([[MS-DOS 7.1]] and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[MKDIR|MKDIR, MD]]: Creates a new directory.\n; [[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]: Displays or changes the value of the PATH [[environment variable]] which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.\n; [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]: Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.\n; [[REN (command)|RENAME, REN]]: Renames a file or directory.\n; [[RMDIR|RMDIR, RD]]: Removes an empty directory.\n; [[SET (DOS command)|SET]]: Sets the value of an [[environment variable]]; without arguments, shows all defined environment variables.\n; [[TIME (command)|TIME]]: Display and set the time of the system.\n; [[TRUENAME]]: Display the fully expanded physical name of a file, resolving [[ASSIGN (DOS command)|ASSIGN]], [[JOIN (DOS command)|JOIN]] and [[SUBST]] logical filesystem mappings.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n; [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]: Display the content of a file on the console.\n; [[UNLOCK (DOS command)|UNLOCK]]: Disables low-level disk access. (MS-DOS 7.1 and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[VER (command)|VER]]: Displays the version of the [[operating system]].\n; [[VERIFY (DOS command)|VERIFY]]: Enable or disable verification of writing for files.\n; [[VOL (command)|VOL]]: Shows information about a volume.\n\n==Batch file commands==\nControl structures are mostly used inside batch files, although they can also be used interactively.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n; <nowiki>:</nowiki>''label'': Defines a target for GOTO.\n; [[CALL (DOS command)|CALL]]: Executes another batch file and returns to the old one and continues.\n; [[FOR (DOS command)|FOR]]: Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\n; [[GOTO]]: Moves execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ({{codett|:likethis}}).\n; [[IF (DOS command)|IF]]: Conditional statement, allows branching of the program execution.\n; [[PAUSE (DOS command)|PAUSE]]: Halts execution of the program and displays a message asking the user to press [[any key]] to continue.\n; [[REM (DOS command)|REM]]: [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]: any text following this command is ignored.\n; [[SHIFT (DOS command)|SHIFT]]: Replaces each of the [[replacement parameter]]s with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\n==IF command==\nOn exit, all external commands submit a [[return code]] (a value between 0 and 255) to the calling program. Most programs have a certain convention for their return codes (for instance, 0 for a successful execution).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_Exitcodes\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/>\n\nIf a program was invoked by COMMAND.COM, the internal IF command with its ERRORLEVEL conditional can be used to test on error conditions of the last invoked external program.\n\nUnder COMMAND.COM, internal commands do not establish a new value.\n\n==Variables==\nBatch files for COMMAND.COM can have four kinds of variables:\n* [[Environment variable]]s: These have the {{codett|%VARIABLE%}} form and are associated with values with the SET statement. Before DOS 3 COMMAND.COM will only expand environment variables in batch mode; that is, not interactively at the command prompt.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n* [[Replacement parameter]]s: These have the form {{codett|%0}}, {{codett|%1}}...{{codett|%9}}, and initially contain the command name and the first nine [[command line parameter]]s passed to the script (e.g., if the invoking command was \"{{codett|myscript.bat John Doe}}\", then {{codett|%0}} is \"myscript.bat\", {{codett|%1}} is \"John\" and {{codett|%2}} is \"Doe\").  The parameters to the right of the ninth can be mapped into range by using the SHIFT statement.\n* Loop variables: Used in loops, they have the {{codett|%%a}} format when run in batch files. These variables are defined solely within a specific FOR statement, and iterate over a certain set of values defined in that FOR statement.\n* Under [[Novell DOS 7]]<!-- 1993 -->, [[OpenDOS 7.01]], [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher, COMMAND.COM also supports a number of [[system information variable]]s,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> a feature earlier found in [[4DOS 3.00]]<!-- 1990 --> and higher<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> as well as in [[Multiuser DOS]],<!-- 1991 --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><!-- not in CDOS 386 1.0 (1987), not sure about CDOS 386 3.0 (1989) --> although most of the supported variable names differ.\n\n==Redirection, piping, and chaining==\nBecause DOS is a single-tasking operating system, [[Pipeline (software)|piping]] is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a [[temporary file]]. COMMAND.COM makes no provision for redirecting the [[Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|standard error]] channel.\n\n; <code>''command'' < ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] from a file or device\n; <code>''command'' > ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], overwriting target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command'' >> ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], appending to target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command1'' | ''command2''</code> : Pipe [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] from ''command1'' to [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] of ''command2''\n; <code>''command1'' \u00b6 ''command2''</code> : \n: Commands separated by ASCII-20 (\u00b6, invoked by {{keypress|Ctrl|T}}) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> In other words, first ''command1'' is executed until termination, then ''command2''.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This is an undocumented feature in COMMAND.COM of [[MS-DOS 5.0|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 5.0]]<!-- tested MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 7 --> and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It is also supported by COMMAND.COM<!-- but not by CMD --> of the Windows NT family<!-- tested Windows XP --> as well as by DR-DOS 7.07. All versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- since 3.xx --> already supported a similar internal function utilizing an exclamation mark (!) instead (a feature originally derived from [[Concurrent DOS]] and [[Multiuser DOS]]) - however, in the single-user line this feature was only available internally (in built-in startup scripts like \"!DATE!TIME\") and indirectly through [[DOSKEY]]'s $T parameter to avoid problems with ! as a valid filename character.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] supports a configurable command line separator ([[4DOS.INI]] CommandSep= or SETDOS /C), which defaults to ^.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> COMMAND.COM in newer versions of Windows NT<!-- works for example in XP, but not in MS-DOS/PC DOS COMMAND.COM --> also supports an {{code|&}} separator for compatibility with the cmd syntax in OS/2 and the Windows NT family.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (cmd, however, does not support the \u00b6 separator.)\n\n==Limitations==\nThe command line length in interactive mode is limited to 126 characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_MSDOS\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe message \"Loading COMMAND.COM\" can be seen on a [[Head-Up Display|HUD]] view of the [[T-800|Terminator]] and the internal viewport of [[RoboCop]] when he reboots.\n\nIn the CGI children's TV series ''[[ReBoot]]'', which takes place inside computers, the leader of a system (the equivalent of a city) is called the COMMAND.COM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[IBMBIO.COM]] / [[IO.SYS]] (starts the command processor as the first process)\n* [[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)]] (to override default command processor)\n* [[COMSPEC (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to reload transient portion of itself)\n* [[CMDLINE (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to pass long command lines to external programs)\n* [[4DOS]] / [[NDOS]] (third-party replacement command processors)\n* [[DOSSHELL]] / [[ViewMAX]] (alternative DOS shells)\n<!-- * [[TASKMAX]] / [[TASKMGR]] (instances daughter processes) -->\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS]] / [[Multiuser DOS]] / [[REAL/32]] (have similar command processors not named COMMAND.COM)\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] (has a similar command processor)\n* [[Transient Program Area]] (TPA) (area availabe for use either by the running application or the transient portion of COMMAND.COM)\n* [[SpartaDOS X]] (a similar implementation for Atari computers)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Microsoft_COMMAND\">[https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/blob/master/v2.0/source/COMMAND.ASM MS-DOS/COMMAND.ASM at master \u00b7 microsoft/MS-DOS \u00b7 GitHub]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\">{{cite book |title=BATTIPs &mdash; Tips & Tricks zur Programmierung von Batchjobs |at=Kapitel 7: ERRORLEVEL abfragen |work=MPDOSTIP |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=1997-05-01 |orig-year=1993-10-01 |language=de |url=http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm#7 |access-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823191411/http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm |archive-date=2017-08-23}} (NB.

For example, if you know you want to copy all of your .TXT files to drive A: and then run CHKDSK to be sure that drive A's file structure is in good shape, you could enter the following command: <code>C:\\>COPY *.TXT A: ^ CHKDSK A:</code> You may put as many commands on the command line as you wish, as long as the total length of the command line does not exceed 511 characters. You can use multiple commands in aliases and batch files as well as at the command line. If you don't like using the default command separator, you can pick another character using the SETDOS /C command or the CommandSep directive in [[4DOS.INI]]. [\u2026] SETDOS /C: (Compound character) This option sets the character used for separating multiple commands on the same line. The default is the caret [^]. You cannot use any of the redirection characters [<>{{!}}], or the blank, tab, comma, or equal sign as the command separator. The command separator is saved by SETLOCAL and restored by ENDLOCAL. This example changes the separator to a tilde [~]: <code>C:\\>SETDOS /C~</code> (You can specify either the character itself, or its ASCII code as a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number preceded by 0x.) [\u2026] CommandSep = c (^): This is the character used to separate multiple commands on the same line. [\u2026] Special Character Compatibility: If you use two or more of our products, or if you want to share aliases and batch files with users of different products, you need to be aware of the differences in three important characters: the Command Separator [\u2026], the Escape Character [\u2026], and the Parameter Character [\u2026].

Now, things have changed since MS-DOS 7.0 [\u2026] COMMAND.COM has internally become an EXE style file, so there is no magic [\u2026] signature [\u2026] to check [\u2026] thus no way for DR-DOS to rule out an incompatible COMMAND.COM.

In the case of DOS, it is the default user interface as well. It has an additional role as the usual first program run after boot (root process), hence being responsible for setting up the system by running the [[AUTOEXEC.BAT]] configuration file, and being the ancestor of all processes.\n\nCOMMAND.COM's successor on [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]] systems is [[cmd.exe]], although COMMAND.COM is available in [[virtual DOS machine]]s on [[IA-32]] versions of those operating systems as well.\n\nThe {{Mono|COMMAND.COM}} filename was also used by {{ill|Disk Control Program|de}} (DCP), an MS-DOS derivative by the former East German [[VEB Robotron]].<ref name=\"DCP_2016\"/>\n\nThe compatible command processor under [[FreeDOS]] is sometimes also named [[FreeCom]].\n\nCOMMAND.COM is a DOS program. Programs launched from COMMAND.COM are DOS programs that use the [[DOS API]] to communicate with the disk operating system.\n\n==Operating modes==\nAs a shell, COMMAND.COM has two distinct modes of operation. The first is [[Read-eval-print loop|interactive mode]], in which the user types commands which are then executed immediately. The second is [[Batch processing|batch mode]], which executes a predefined sequence of commands stored as a text file with the [[Batch file|.BAT]] extension.\n\n=={{anchor|Prompt}}Internal commands==\nInternal commands are commands stored directly inside the COMMAND.COM binary. Thus, they are always available but can only be executed directly from the command interpreter.\n\nAll commands are executed after the {{keypress|Enter}} key is pressed at the end of the line. COMMAND.COM is not case-sensitive, meaning commands can be typed in any mixture of upper and lower case.\n\n; [[BREAK (DOS command)|BREAK]]: Controls the handling of program interruption with {{keypress|Ctrl|C}} or {{keypress|Ctrl|Break}}.\n; [[CHCP (command)|CHCP]]: Displays or changes the current system [[code page]].\n; [[CHDIR|CHDIR, CD]]: Changes the current [[working directory]] or displays the current directory.\n; [[CLS (DOS command)|CLS]]: Clears the screen.\n; [[COPY (DOS command)|COPY]]: Copies one file to another (if the destination file already exists, MS-DOS asks whether to replace it). (See also [[XCOPY]], an external command that could also copy directory trees).\n; [[CTTY (DOS command)|CTTY]]: Defines the device to use for input and output.\n; [[DATE (command)|DATE]]: Display and set the date of the system.\n; [[DEL (command)|DEL, ERASE]]: Deletes a file. When used on a directory, deletes all files inside the directory only. In comparison, the external command [[DELTREE]] deletes all subdirectories and files inside a directory as well as the directory itself.\n; [[DIR (command)|DIR]]: Lists the files in the specified directory.\n; [[ECHO (command)|ECHO]]: Toggles whether text is displayed ({{codett|ECHO ON}}) or not ({{codett|ECHO OFF}}). Also displays text on the screen ({{codett|ECHO text}}).\n; [[EXIT (command)|EXIT]]: Exits from COMMAND.COM and returns to the program which launched it.\n; [[LFNFOR]]: Enables or disables the return of [[long filename]]s by the FOR command. ([[Windows 9x]]).\n; [[LOADHIGH|LOADHIGH, LH]]: Loads a program into [[Upper Memory Area|upper memory]] ({{codett|HILOAD}} in [[DR DOS]]).\n; [[LOCK (DOS command)|LOCK]]: Enables external programs to perform low-level disk access to a volume. ([[MS-DOS 7.1]] and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[MKDIR|MKDIR, MD]]: Creates a new directory.\n; [[PATH (DOS command)|PATH]]: Displays or changes the value of the PATH [[environment variable]] which controls the places where COMMAND.COM will search for executable files.\n; [[PROMPT (DOS command)|PROMPT]]: Displays or change the value of the PROMPT environment variable which controls the appearance of the prompt.\n; [[REN (command)|RENAME, REN]]: Renames a file or directory.\n; [[RMDIR|RMDIR, RD]]: Removes an empty directory.\n; [[SET (DOS command)|SET]]: Sets the value of an [[environment variable]]; without arguments, shows all defined environment variables.\n; [[TIME (command)|TIME]]: Display and set the time of the system.\n; [[TRUENAME]]: Display the fully expanded physical name of a file, resolving [[ASSIGN (DOS command)|ASSIGN]], [[JOIN (DOS command)|JOIN]] and [[SUBST]] logical filesystem mappings.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n; [[TYPE (DOS command)|TYPE]]: Display the content of a file on the console.\n; [[UNLOCK (DOS command)|UNLOCK]]: Disables low-level disk access. (MS-DOS 7.1 and [[Windows 9x]] only)\n; [[VER (command)|VER]]: Displays the version of the [[operating system]].\n; [[VERIFY (DOS command)|VERIFY]]: Enable or disable verification of writing for files.\n; [[VOL (command)|VOL]]: Shows information about a volume.\n\n==Batch file commands==\nControl structures are mostly used inside batch files, although they can also be used interactively.<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/>\n\n; <nowiki>:</nowiki>''label'': Defines a target for GOTO.\n; [[CALL (DOS command)|CALL]]: Executes another batch file and returns to the old one and continues.\n; [[FOR (DOS command)|FOR]]: Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.\n; [[GOTO]]: Moves execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ({{codett|:likethis}}).\n; [[IF (DOS command)|IF]]: Conditional statement, allows branching of the program execution.\n; [[PAUSE (DOS command)|PAUSE]]: Halts execution of the program and displays a message asking the user to press [[any key]] to continue.\n; [[REM (DOS command)|REM]]: [[comment (computer programming)|comment]]: any text following this command is ignored.\n; [[SHIFT (DOS command)|SHIFT]]: Replaces each of the [[replacement parameter]]s with the subsequent one (e.g. {{codett|%0}} with {{codett|%1}}, {{codett|%1}} with {{codett|%2}}, etc.).\n\n==IF command==\nOn exit, all external commands submit a [[return code]] (a value between 0 and 255) to the calling program. Most programs have a certain convention for their return codes (for instance, 0 for a successful execution).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\"/><ref name=\"FD_2003_Errorlevel\"/><ref name=\"Paul_2003_Exitcodes\"/><ref name=\"Allen_2005\"/>\n\nIf a program was invoked by COMMAND.COM, the internal IF command with its ERRORLEVEL conditional can be used to test on error conditions of the last invoked external program.\n\nUnder COMMAND.COM, internal commands do not establish a new value.\n\n==Variables==\nBatch files for COMMAND.COM can have four kinds of variables:\n* [[Environment variable]]s: These have the {{codett|%VARIABLE%}} form and are associated with values with the SET statement. Before DOS 3 COMMAND.COM will only expand environment variables in batch mode; that is, not interactively at the command prompt.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n* [[Replacement parameter]]s: These have the form {{codett|%0}}, {{codett|%1}}...{{codett|%9}}, and initially contain the command name and the first nine [[command line parameter]]s passed to the script (e.g., if the invoking command was \"{{codett|myscript.bat John Doe}}\", then {{codett|%0}} is \"myscript.bat\", {{codett|%1}} is \"John\" and {{codett|%2}} is \"Doe\").  The parameters to the right of the ninth can be mapped into range by using the SHIFT statement.\n* Loop variables: Used in loops, they have the {{codett|%%a}} format when run in batch files. These variables are defined solely within a specific FOR statement, and iterate over a certain set of values defined in that FOR statement.\n* Under [[Novell DOS 7]]<!-- 1993 -->, [[OpenDOS 7.01]], [[DR-DOS 7.02]] and higher, COMMAND.COM also supports a number of [[system information variable]]s,<ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER_CH7\"/><ref name=\"Caldera_1998_USER\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> a feature earlier found in [[4DOS 3.00]]<!-- 1990 --> and higher<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> as well as in [[Multiuser DOS]],<!-- 1991 --><ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/><!-- not in CDOS 386 1.0 (1987), not sure about CDOS 386 3.0 (1989) --> although most of the supported variable names differ.\n\n==Redirection, piping, and chaining==\nBecause DOS is a single-tasking operating system, [[Pipeline (software)|piping]] is achieved by running commands sequentially, redirecting to and from a [[temporary file]]. COMMAND.COM makes no provision for redirecting the [[Standard streams#Standard error (stderr)|standard error]] channel.\n\n; <code>''command'' < ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] from a file or device\n; <code>''command'' > ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], overwriting target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command'' >> ''filename''</code> : Redirect [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]], appending to target file if it exists.\n; <code>''command1'' | ''command2''</code> : Pipe [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] from ''command1'' to [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]] of ''command2''\n; <code>''command1'' \u00b6 ''command2''</code> : \n: Commands separated by ASCII-20 (\u00b6, invoked by {{keypress|Ctrl|T}}) are executed in sequence (chaining of commands).<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> In other words, first ''command1'' is executed until termination, then ''command2''.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> This is an undocumented feature in COMMAND.COM of [[MS-DOS 5.0|MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS 5.0]]<!-- tested MS-DOS 6.2 and PC DOS 7 --> and higher.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> It is also supported by COMMAND.COM<!-- but not by CMD --> of the Windows NT family<!-- tested Windows XP --> as well as by DR-DOS 7.07. All versions of DR-DOS COMMAND.COM<!-- since 3.xx --> already supported a similar internal function utilizing an exclamation mark (!) instead (a feature originally derived from [[Concurrent DOS]] and [[Multiuser DOS]]) - however, in the single-user line this feature was only available internally (in built-in startup scripts like \"!DATE!TIME\") and indirectly through [[DOSKEY]]'s $T parameter to avoid problems with ! as a valid filename character.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_NWDOSTIP\"/> [[4DOS]] supports a configurable command line separator ([[4DOS.INI]] CommandSep= or SETDOS /C), which defaults to ^.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> COMMAND.COM in newer versions of Windows NT<!-- works for example in XP, but not in MS-DOS/PC DOS COMMAND.COM --> also supports an {{code|&}} separator for compatibility with the cmd syntax in OS/2 and the Windows NT family.<ref name=\"4DOS_8.00_HELP\"/> (cmd, however, does not support the \u00b6 separator.)\n\n==Limitations==\nThe command line length in interactive mode is limited to 126 characters.<ref name=\"Paul_1997_MSDOS\"/><ref name=\"Paul_1997_4DOSTIP\"/><ref name=\"Schulman_1994_Undocumented-DOS\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe message \"Loading COMMAND.COM\" can be seen on a [[Head-Up Display|HUD]] view of the [[T-800|Terminator]] and the internal viewport of [[RoboCop]] when he reboots.\n\nIn the CGI children's TV series ''[[ReBoot]]'', which takes place inside computers, the leader of a system (the equivalent of a city) is called the COMMAND.COM.\n\n==See also==\n* [[IBMBIO.COM]] / [[IO.SYS]] (starts the command processor as the first process)\n* [[SHELL (CONFIG.SYS directive)]] (to override default command processor)\n* [[COMSPEC (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to reload transient portion of itself)\n* [[CMDLINE (environment variable)]] (set by COMMAND.COM to pass long command lines to external programs)\n* [[4DOS]] / [[NDOS]] (third-party replacement command processors)\n* [[DOSSHELL]] / [[ViewMAX]] (alternative DOS shells)\n<!-- * [[TASKMAX]] / [[TASKMGR]] (instances daughter processes) -->\n* [[List of DOS commands]]\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n* [[Concurrent DOS]] / [[Multiuser DOS]] / [[REAL/32]] (have similar command processors not named COMMAND.COM)\n* [[PC-MOS/386]] (has a similar command processor)\n* [[Transient Program Area]] (TPA) (area availabe for use either by the running application or the transient portion of COMMAND.COM)\n* [[SpartaDOS X]] (a similar implementation for Atari computers)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Microsoft_COMMAND\">[https://github.com/microsoft/MS-DOS/blob/master/v2.0/source/COMMAND.ASM MS-DOS/COMMAND.ASM at master \u00b7 microsoft/MS-DOS \u00b7 GitHub]</ref>\n<ref name=\"Paul_1997_BATTIPS\">{{cite book |title=BATTIPs &mdash; Tips & Tricks zur Programmierung von Batchjobs |at=Kapitel 7: ERRORLEVEL abfragen |work=MPDOSTIP |author-first=Matthias R. |author-last=Paul |date=1997-05-01 |orig-year=1993-10-01 |language=de |url=http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm#7 |access-date=2017-08-23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170823191411/http://www.antonis.de/dos/batchtut/battips/index.htm |archive-date=2017-08-23}} (NB.

For example, if you know you want to copy all of your .TXT files to drive A: and then run CHKDSK to be sure that drive A's file structure is in good shape, you could enter the following command: <code>C:\\>COPY *.TXT A: ^ CHKDSK A:</code> You may put as many commands on the command line as you wish, as long as the total length of the command line does not exceed 511 characters. You can use multiple commands in aliases and batch files as well as at the command line. If you don't like using the default command separator, you can pick another character using the SETDOS /C command or the CommandSep directive in [[4DOS.INI]]. [\u2026] SETDOS /C: (Compound character) This option sets the character used for separating multiple commands on the same line. The default is the caret [^]. You cannot use any of the redirection characters [<>{{!}}], or the blank, tab, comma, or equal sign as the command separator. The command separator is saved by SETLOCAL and restored by ENDLOCAL. This example changes the separator to a tilde [~]: <code>C:\\>SETDOS /C~</code> (You can specify either the character itself, or its ASCII code as a decimal number, or a hexadecimal number preceded by 0x.) [\u2026] CommandSep = c (^): This is the character used to separate multiple commands on the same line. [\u2026] Special Character Compatibility: If you use two or more of our products, or if you want to share aliases and batch files with users of different products, you need to be aware of the differences in three important characters: the Command Separator [\u2026], the Escape Character [\u2026], and the Parameter Character [\u2026].

The infrastructure cost for regular grid patterns is generally higher than for patterns with discontinuous streets.\n\nCosts for streets depend largely on four variables: street width, street length, [[city block|block]] width and pavement width. Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, facilitate [[pedestrian]] movement. The geometry helps with orientation and [[wayfinding]] and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.\n\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the grid plan method of land measurement was called [[centuriation]]. The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures; some of the earliest [[planned cities]] were built using grid plans.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient grid plans===\n[[File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|thumb|right|The grid plan of [[Miletus]] in the Classical period]]\nBy 2600 BC, [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], major cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], were built with blocks divided by a grid of straight streets, running north\u2013south and east\u2013west. Each block was subdivided by small lanes.<ref>Jane McIntosh, ''The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives'' ; ABC-CLIO, 2008; {{ISBN|978-1-57607-907-2}} ; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA231 231], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA346 346].</ref> The cities and monasteries of [[Sirkap]], [[Taxila]] and [[Madhyapur Thimi|Thimi]] (in the [[Indus Valley|Indus]] and [[Kathmandu Valley]]s), dating from the 1st millennium BC to the 11th century AD, also had grid-based designs.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Mohan|last1=Pant|first2=Shjui |last2=Fumo|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jaabe/4/1/4_1_51/_pdf |title=The Grid and Modular Measures in The Town Planning of Mohenjodaro and Kathmandu Valley: A Study on Modular Measures in Block and Plot Divisions in the Planning of Mohenjodaro and Sirkap (Pakistan), and Thimi (Kathmandu Valley)|work=Journal of Asian Architecture and Building Engineering|pp=51-59|date=May 2005|volume=4|issue=1|access-date=18 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nA workers' village (2570\u20132500 BC) at [[Giza]], [[Egypt]], housed a rotating labor force and was laid out in blocks of long galleries separated by streets in a formal grid. Many pyramid-cult cities used a common orientation: a north\u2013south axis from the royal palace and an east\u2013west axis from the temple, meeting at a central plaza where King and God merged and crossed.\n\n[[Hammurabi]] king of the [[Babylonia|Babylonian Empire]] in the 17th century BC, ordered the rebuilding of [[Babylon]]: constructing and restoring temples, city walls, public buildings, and irrigation canals. The streets of Babylon were wide and straight, intersected approximately at right angles, and were paved with bricks and [[bitumen]].\n\nThe tradition of grid plans is continuous in [[China]] from the 15th century BC onward in the [[Ancient Chinese urban planning|traditional urban planning]] of various ancient Chinese states. Guidelines put into written form in the [[Kaogongji]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-476 BC) stated: \"a capital city should be square on plan. Three gates on each side of the perimeter lead into the nine main streets that crisscross the city and define its grid-pattern. And for its layout the city should have the Royal Court situated in the south, the Marketplace in the north, the Imperial Ancestral Temple in the east and the Altar to the Gods of Land and Grain in the west.\"\n\n[[Teotihuacan]], near modern-day [[Mexico City]], is the largest ancient grid-plan site in the [[Americas]]. The city's grid covered 21 square kilometres(8 square miles).\n\nPerhaps the most well-known grid system is that spread through the colonies of the Roman Empire. The archetypal [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] was introduced to Italy first by the Greeks, with such information transferred by way of trade and conquest.<ref name=\"Stanislawski 116\">Stanislawski, Dan (1946).  \"The Grid-Pattern Town\", Geog. Rev., xxxvi, pp. 105-120, p. 116.</ref>\n\n====Ancient Greece====\nAlthough the idea of the grid was present in Hellenic societal and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form.<ref name=\"Burns 39\">Burns, Ross (2005), ''Damascus: A History'', Routledge, p. 39</ref> The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were a step in the propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan,<ref name=\"Burns 39\"/> that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points<ref name=\"Burns 39\"/> and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\">Higgins, Hannah (2009) ''The Grid Book''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. p.60. {{ISBN|978-0-262-51240-4}}</ref> This was probably best exemplified in [[Priene]], in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out{{clarify|date=July 2015}} towards a river and the city of [[Miletus]].<ref>Belozerskaya, Marina and Lapatin, Kenneth (2004), Ancient Greece: art, architecture, and history. Los Angeles: Getty Publications, p. 94.</ref>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n[[File:Mapa Caesaraugusta.svg|thumb| [[Caesaraugusta]] Roman city matching the current [[Zaragoza]] city map:<br />\n1.- Decumano; 2.- Cardo ; 3.- [[Foro romano de Caesaraugusta|Foro de Caesaraugusta]] ; 4.- [[Museo del Puerto Fluvial de Caesaraugusta|Puerto fluvial]]; 5.- [[Termas romanas de Caesaraugusta|Termas p\u00fablicas]]; 6.- [[Teatro romano de Caesaraugusta|Teatro]]; 7.- [[Muralla romana de Zaragoza|Muralla]]]]\n\nThe [[Etruscan people]], whose territories in Italy encompassed what would eventually become Rome, founded what is now the city of [[Marzabotto]] at the end of the 6th century BC. Its layout was based on Greek Ionic ideas, and it was here that the main east\u2013west and north\u2013south axes of a town (the ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' respectively) could first be seen in Italy. According to Stanislawski (1946), the Romans did use grids until the time of the late Republic or early Empire, when they introduced ''[[Roman centuriation|centuriation]]'', a system which they spread around the Mediterranean and into northern Europe later on.<ref name=\"Stanislawski 116\"/>\n[[File:Spirano-Stezzano.jpg|thumb|left|Straight road in the [[Province of Bergamo]], [[Italy]], following line of [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] ]]\n\nThe military expansion of this period facilitated the adoption of the grid form as standard: the Romans established ''[[castra]]'' (forts or camps) first as military centres; some of them developed into administrative hubs. The Roman grid was similar in form to the Greek version of a grid, but allowed for practical considerations. For example, Roman ''castra'' were often sited on flat land, especially close to or on important nodes like river crossings or intersections of trade routes.<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> The dimensions of the ''castra'' were often standard, with each of its four walls generally having a length of {{convert|2150|ft|m|order=flip}}. Familiarity was the aim of such standardisation: soldiers could be stationed anywhere around the Empire, and orientation would be easy within established towns if they had a standard layout. Each would have the aforementioned ''[[decumanus maximus]]'' and ''[[cardo maximus]]'' at its heart, and their intersection would form the forum, around which would be sited important public buildings. Indeed, such was the degree of similarity between towns that Higgins states that soldiers \"would be housed at the same address as they moved from ''castra'' to ''castra''\".<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> Pompeii has been cited by both Higgins<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> and Laurence<ref>Laurence, Ray (2007), ''Roman Pompeii: space and society'', p. 15-16.</ref>{{failed verification|date=February 2018}} as the best preserved example of the Roman grid.\n\nOutside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically {{convert|2400|ft|m|order=flip}} per side (called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''centuria'']]), and contained 100 parcels of land (each called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''heredium'']]).<ref name=\"Gelernter 15\">Gelernter, Mark (2001), ''A history of American architecture: buildings in their cultural and technological context'', p. 15.</ref> The ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.<ref name=\"Gelernter 15\"/>\n\nWhile the imposition of only one town form regardless of region could be seen as an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and interchangeability, both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.\n\n===Asia from the first millennium AD===\nAs [[Japan]] and the [[Korean peninsula]] became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning principles in numerous locations. In Korea, [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Unified Silla]], and [[Shangjing Longquanfu|Sanggyeong]], the capital of [[Balhae]], adapted the [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as [[Fujiwara-kyo|Fujiwara-Ky\u00f4]] (AD 694-710), [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (Heij\u00f4-Ky\u00f4, AD 710-784), and [[Kyoto]] (Heian-Ky\u00f4, AD 794-1868) also adapted from Tang's capital, [[Chang'an]]. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of [[Tokyo]] eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the [[Edo Castle]] grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the [[Japanese addressing system]] is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.\n\nThe grid-planning tradition in Asia continued through the beginning of the 20th century, with [[Sapporo]], Japan (est. 1868) following a grid plan under American influence.\n\n===Europe and its colonies (12th-17th centuries)===\n[[File:Sch\u00e9ma bastide mod\u00e8le Gascon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bastide]] schema in [[Gascony]]]]\nNew [[Europe]]an towns were planned using grids beginning in the 12th century, most prodigiously in the [[bastides]] of southern [[France]] that were built during the 13th and 14th centuries. Medieval European [[new town]]s using grid plans were widespread, ranging from [[Wales]] to the [[Florence|Florentine]] region. Many were built on ancient grids originally established as Roman colonial outposts. In the British Isles, the planned new town system involving a grid street layout was part of the system of [[burgage]].\n\nThe Roman model was also used in Spanish settlements during the [[Reconquista]] of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was subsequently applied in the new cities established during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], after the founding of [[San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]] (Canary Islands) in 1496. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041215070244/http://www.arc.miami.edu/Law%20of%20Indies.html Laws of the Indies] to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza's corners. Hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations.\n\nThe [[baroque]] capital city of [[Malta]], [[Valletta]], dating back to the 16th Century, was built following a rigid grid plan of uniformly designed houses, dotted with palaces, churches and squares.\n\nThe grid plan became popular with the start of the [[Renaissance]] in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of [[Mannheim]] in [[Germany]] was the first Renaissance city laid out on the grid plan. Later came the New Town in [[Edinburgh]] and almost the entire city centre of [[Glasgow]], and many [[Planned community|planned communities]] and cities in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\n[[Derry]], constructed in 1613\u20131618, was the first [[planned city]] in [[Ireland]]. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of [[British North America]].\n\n=== Russia (18th century) ===\n[[File:Homann MapSpb1716-17.png|thumb|The map of St. Petersburg (1717). The grid of 'lines' and 'prospekts' is seen across the whole rectangular [[Vasilyevsky Island]], while actually only the eastern part was built]]\nIn [[Russia]] the first [[planned city]] was [[St. Petersburg]] founded in 1703 by [[Peter the Great|Peter I]]. Being aware of the modern European construction experience which he examined in the years of his [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|Grand Embassy to Europe]], czar ordered [[Domenico Trezzini]] to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for [[Vasilyevsky Island]] was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in [[Amsterdam]]), with three lengthwise thoroughfares, rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.\n\nThe shape of street blocks on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] is the same, as was later implemented in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] for [[Manhattan]]: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively narrow street with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called [[Lines of Vasilyevsky Island|''Liniya'' (Line)]]) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term ''[[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]'' was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named ''Bolshoi'' (''Big''), ''Sredniy ''(''Middle'') and ''Maly'' (''Small'') while the far ends of each lines cross with the embankments of [[Bolshaya Neva River|Bolshaya Neva]] and [[Smolenka River|Smolenka]] rivers in the delta of the [[Neva River]].\n\nThe peculiarity of 'lines' (streets) naming in this grid is that are each side of street has its own number, so one 'line' is a side of a street, not the whole street. The numbering is latently zero-based, however the supposed \"zero line\" has its proper name ''Kadetskaya liniya'', while the opposite side of this street is called the '1-st Line'. Next street is named the '2-nd Line' on the eastern side, and the '3-rd Line' on the western side. After the reorganization of house numbering in 1834 and 1858 the even house numbers are used on the odd-numbered lines, and respectively odd house numbers are used for the even-numbered lines. The maximum numbers for 'lines' in Petersburg are 28-29th lines.\n\nLater in the middle of the 18th century another grid of rectangular blocks with the numbered streets appeared in the continental part of the city: 13 streets named from the '1-st Rota' up to the '13-th Rota', where the [[Company (military unit)|companies]] ({{lang-de|Rotte}}, {{lang-ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430}}) of the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]] were located.\n\n===Early United States (17th-19th centuries)===\n[[File:Grid 1811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] for [[Manhattan]]|344x344px]][[File:Savannah Portland NewYork City Blocks.svg|right|thumb|A diagram of three U.S. city grids at the same scale showing the differences in dimensions and configuration]][[File:American Grid Comparison.jpg|thumbnail|left|Twenty American grids compared at the same scale]][[File:Map of the Original City of Philadelphia in 1682 by Thomas Holme.jpg|thumb|Map of the Original City of Philadelphia in 1682 by Thomas Holme]]\nMany of the earliest cities in the United States, such as [[Boston]], did not start with a grid system.<ref>[[Back Bay]], [[Dorchester Heights]], and [[South Boston]] all have grid layouts.</ref> However, even in pre-revolutionary days some cities saw the benefits of such a layout. [[New Haven Colony]], one of the earliest colonies in America, was designed with a tiny 9-square grid at its founding in 1638. On a grander scale, [[Philadelphia]] was designed on a rectilinear street grid in 1682: one of the first cities in North America to use a grid system.<ref name=\"crabgrass\">{{cite crabgrass}}</ref><ref>[http://www.explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=3&chapter=3&page=2 ExplorePaHistory.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the urging of city founder [[William Penn]], surveyor [[Thomas Holme]] designed a system of wide streets intersecting at right angles between the [[Schuylkill River]] to the west and the [[Delaware River]] to the east, including five squares of dedicated parkland. Penn advertised this orderly design as a safeguard against overcrowding, fire, and disease, which plagued European cities. Holme drafted an ideal version of the grid,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/kjohnso1/pictures/tholme1683inch9.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070420061427/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Humanities/kjohnso1/pictures/tholme1683inch9.jpg |archivedate=2007-04-20 }} Swarthmore College</ref> but alleyways sprouted within and between larger blocks as the city took shape. As the United States expanded westward, grid-based city planning modeled off of Philadelphia's layout would become popular among frontier cities, making grids ubiquitous across the country.<ref>http://www.thegreatamericangrid.com/archives/777</ref>\n\nAnother well-known grid plan is the plan for [[New York City]] formulated in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], a proposal by the state [[legislature]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] for the development of most of [[Manhattan]]<ref>Landers, John ''Twelve Historical New York City Street and Transit Maps from 1860 to 1967'' {{ISBN|1-882608-16X}}</ref> above [[Houston Street]].\n\n[[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]], was planned under [[French-American]] architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original [[District of Columbia]] was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. These diagonals are often connected by [[traffic circle]]s, such as [[Dupont Circle]] and [[Washington Circle]]. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the [[McMillan Plan]], led by Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], was adopted to build a [[National Mall]] and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.\n\nOften, some of the streets in a grid are numbered (First, Second, etc.), lettered, or arranged in alphabetical order. Downtown [[San Diego]] uses all three schemes: north\u2013south streets are numbered from west to east, and east\u2013west streets are split between a lettered series running southward from A through L and a series of streets named after trees or plants, running northward alphabetically from Ash to Walnut. As in many cities, some of these streets have been given new names violating the system (the former D Street is now Broadway, the former 12th Avenue is now Park Boulevard, etc.); this has meant that 2nd, not 1st, is the most common street name in the United States.<ref>[http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-factoids/most-common-us-street-names NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES: Most Common U.S. Street Names at nlc.org] Accessed 16 May 2017</ref>\n\nAn exception to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1733), known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]]. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large corner blocks, four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) is known as a ward.<ref>Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan''. University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref> Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called [[fractal]].<ref>Batty, M. & Longley, P.

The configuration also represents an example of functional [[shared space]], where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.<ref>Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', p. 175</ref>\n\nIn the westward development of the United States, the use of the grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in [[Salt Lake City]] (1870), [[Dodge City]] (1872) and [[Oklahoma City]] (1890). In these western cities the streets were numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.<ref name=\"crabgrass\" />\n\nOne of the main advantages of the grid plan was that it allowed the rapid [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] and [[auction]] of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the [[Republic of Texas]] decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], the functioning of the government required the rapid population of the town, which was named [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Charged with the task, [[Edwin Waller]] designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, and by the end of the year the entire Texas government had arrived by [[cart|oxcart]] at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time of the grid's adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.\n\n===Early 19th century \u2013 Australasia===\nIn 1836 [[William Light]] drew up his plans for [[Adelaide, South Australia]], spanning the [[River Torrens]].

This grid of streets, laid out when there were only a few hundred settlers, became the nucleus for what is now a city of over 5 million people, the city of Melbourne. The unusual dimensions of the allotments and the incorporation of narrow 'little' streets were the result of compromise between Hoddle's desire to employ the regulations established in 1829 by previous [[New South Wales]] Governor Ralph Darling, requiring square blocks and wide, spacious streets and Bourke's desire for rear access ways (now the 'little' streets, for example [[Little Collins Street]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Miles|title=Melbourne: The City's History and Development|date=1995|publisher=City of Melbourne|location=Melbourne|pages=25-29}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Christchurch Central City|Christchurch]], New Zealand, was planned by [[Edward Jollie]] in 1850.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf | title = Contextual Historical Overview for Christchurch City| type = PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522213304/http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf|date=June 2005|archive-date=22 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century to the present===\n[[File:BCN01.JPG|thumb|[[Barcelona]]]]\n[[File:Original design of Barcelona's city blocks.svg|right|thumb|The city blocks and streets of Barcelona as conceived by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1.

This paradigm prevailed between about 1930 and 1960, especially in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where notable examples include [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California|Leimert Park]] (an early example) and [[Panorama City, Los Angeles, California|Panorama City]] (a late-period one).\n\n[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ouagadougou]] ([[Burkina Faso]], ex [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], [[Africa]]), 1930]]A prominent 20th century urbanist, [[Lewis Mumford]], severely criticized some of the grid's characteristics: \"With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty.\"<ref>[[Lewis Mumford|Mumford, Lewis]] (1961) ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformation, and Its Prospects''.

This is a thoroughly \"asymmetric\" street arrangement in which a residential subdivision\u2014often surrounded by a [[Noise barrier|noise wall]] or a [[gated community|security gate]]\u2014is completely separated from the road network except for one or two connections to arterial roads. In a way, this is a return to [[medieval]] styles: as noted in [[Spiro Kostof]]'s seminal history of [[urban design]], ''The City Shaped'', there is a strong resemblance between the street arrangements of modern American suburbs and those of medieval [[Arab]] and [[Moorish]] cities. In each case, the community unit at hand\u2014the clan or extended family in the [[Muslim]] world, the economically homogeneous [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] in modern suburbia\u2014isolates itself from the larger urban scene by using dead ends and ''[[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]]''.\n[[File:Milton Keynes Sector.jpg|right|thumb|A one km<sup>2</sup> sector in [[Milton Keynes]] framed by major roads in a grid configuration. The road network within the sector uses cul-de-sac streets complemented by bike and foot paths which connect the entire sector and beyond.]]\n\n====Milton Keynes====\n{{Main|Milton Keynes grid road system}}\nOne famous grid system is in the British new town of [[Milton Keynes]]. In this planned city, which began construction in 1967, a system of ten \"horizontal\" (roughly east\u2013west) and eleven \"vertical\" (roughly north\u2013south) roads was used, with [[roundabout]]s at each intersection. The horizontal roads were all given names ending in 'way' and H numbers (for 'horizontal', e.g. H3 Monks Way). The vertical roads were given names ending in 'street' and V numbers (for 'vertical', e.g. [[V6 Grafton Street]]). Each grid road was spaced roughly one kilometre along from the next, forming squares of approximately one square kilometre. Each square and each roundabout was given its own name. The system provided very easy transport within the city, although it confused visitors who were unfamiliar with the system. The grid squares thus formed are far larger than the city blocks described earlier, and the road layouts within the grid squares are generally 'organic' in form \u2013 matching the street hierarchy model described above.\n\n== Benefits and criticisms ==\n\n===Financial cost===\n[[File:Block Sizes and Street Length.svg|thumb|right|Block sizes and street length]]\n[[File:13\u00bd Street.jpg|thumb|right|In a numbered grid system, adding an extra street can cause confusion]]\n\n''Street width'', or right of way (ROW), influences the amount of land that is devoted to streets, which becomes unavailable for development and therefore represents an opportunity cost. The wider the street, the higher the opportunity cost. Street width is determined by circulation and aesthetic considerations and is not dependent on the pattern configuration. Any configuration can have wide or narrow streets.\n\n''Street length'' influences proportionately the amount of street components that have to be constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.\n\n''Pavement width'' influences the cost by affecting the amount of materials and labour required to provide a finished road surface. Pavement width is generally based on traffic engineering considerations and is not dependent on pattern configuration. As with the street width, any pattern can have wide or narrow pavements.\nOf all three factors that affect cost, street width, street length and pavement width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that the other variables, though optional, can play a role.\n\nTraditional orthogonal grid patterns generally have greater street frequencies than discontinuous patterns. For example, Portland's block is 200 feet \u00d7 200 feet while Miletus' is half that size and Timgad's half again (see diagram). Houston, Sacramento and Barcelona are progressively bigger reaching up to four times the area of Portland's block. New York's 1811 plan (see above) has blocks of {{convert|200|ft}}. in width and variable lengths ranging from about 500 to 900 feet. The corresponding frequency of streets for each of these block sizes affects the street length.\n\nA simple example of a grid street pattern (see diagram) illustrates the progressive reduction in ''total'' street length (the sum of all individual street lengths) and the corresponding increase in block length. For a corresponding reduction of one, two, three and four streets within this {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel, the street length is reduced from an original total of 12,600 to 7,680 linear feet, a 39% reduction. Simultaneously, block lengths increase from 200 \u00d7 200 feet to 1240 \u00d7 200 feet. When all five blocks have reached the ultimate size of {{convert|1240 |feet}} four street lengths out of total eight have been eliminated. Block lengths of 1000 feet or larger rarely appear in grid plans and are not recommended as they hinder pedestrian movement (Pedestrianism, below). From the pedestrian perspective, the smaller the block is, the easier the navigation and the more direct the route. Consequently, the finer grids are preferred.\n\nPatterns that incorporate discontinuous street types such as crescents and [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]] have not, in general, regarded pedestrian movement as a priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops and so does the ''total'' street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, it is not the street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.\n\nAn inherent advantage of the orthogonal geometry of a proper grid is its tendency to yield regular lots in well-packed sequences. This maximizes the use of the land of the block; it does not, however, affect street frequency. Any frequency of orthogonal streets produces the same [[packing problems|packing]] effect. Orthogonal geometry also minimizes disputes over lot boundaries and maximizes the number of lots that could front a given street. [[John Randal]] said Manhattan's grid plan facilitated \"buying, selling and improving real estate\".<ref name=\"crabgrass\" />\n\nAnother important aspect of street grids and the use of rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.\n\n===Ecological features, rain water absorption, and pollutant generation===\n[[File:Platslc.jpg|thumb|right|Surveyor's plan of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s - an example of a typical, uniform, square-grid street network]]\nTypical uniform grids are unresponsive to [[topography]]. [[Priene]]'s plan, for example, is set on a hill side and most of its north\u2013south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as [[San Francisco]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], follow Priene's example, ''e.g.''. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.\n\nThe same inflexibility of the grid leads to disregarding [[Natural environment|environment]]ally sensitive areas such as small streams and [[creek (stream)|creeks]] or mature woodlots in preference for the application of the immutable geometry. It is said of the NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, [[reductionist]] solution to a multifaceted issue.\n\nThe grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of [[impermeable surface]]s in the street pavement and the [[sidewalk]]s. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of [[rain|rain water]] on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty is compounded by the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.\n\nSome cities, notably [[Seattle]], have devised means to improve a street's retention capacity. However, frequent intersections as they occur in a regular grid would pose an obstacle to their effective application.\n\nA street network pattern can affect the production of pollutants by the amount of car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to [[pedestrian]]s. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of [[pollutant]] [[exhaust gas|emissions]]. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20&nbsp;mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50&nbsp;mph.<ref>Final Facility Specific Speed Correction Factors:M6.SPD.002 David Brzezinski, Constance Hart, Phil Enns Assessment and Standards Division, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ref> This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.\n\n===Social environment and security===\n\nIn his seminal study (1982) on livable streets that was conducted in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for [[traffic calming]] and for several initiatives such as [[living street]]s and [[Home Zone]]s, all of which are aimed at improving a street's social milieu. The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.\n\nA key characteristic of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents.<ref>Philip Langdon, 2006: Seaside Stews Over Street Connections. ''New Urban News'', September 2006</ref> Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |title=Traditional Neighborhood Development Street Design Guidelines |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] |date=October 1999 |location=Washington, DC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220174833/http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |access-date=May 23, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe geometry of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a [[Defensible Space Theory]] described ways to improve the social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.\n\nThe question of neighbourhood security has been a constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study<ref>Hillier, Bill and Sahbaz, Ozlem (March 2008) \"An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once?\" Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, [[University College London]]</ref> did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs\u2013de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear cul-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.\n\nA recent study in California<ref>Handy, Susan; Sommer, Samantha; Ogilvie, Julie; Cao, Xinyu; and Mokhtarian, Patricia (2007) \"Cul-de-Sacs and Children's Outdoor Play: Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence\" [[University of California, Davis]]</ref> examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce [[Perceived risk|perceived danger]] from traffic, and thereby encourage more outdoor play.  It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving. Similar studies in Europe<ref>Huttenmoser, Marco and Marie Meierhofer (1995) \"Children and Their Living Surroundings for the Everyday Life and Development of Children.\" Children's Environments 12(4): 1-17</ref> and most recently in Australia<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Veitch | first1 = Jenny | last2 = Salmon | first2 = Jo | last3 = Ball | first3 = Kylie | lastauthoramp= yes | year = 2010 | title = Individual, social and physical environmental correlates of children's active free-play: a cross-sectional study | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 11 | doi = 10.1186/1479-5868-7-11 | pmid = 20181061 | pmc = 2841089 }}</ref> found that children's outdoor play is significantly reduced on through roads where traffic is, or perceived by parents to be, a risk.  As a result of this misperception of risk, children living in cul-de-sac communities are more likely to be killed by vehicles.  This increased risk of death is due to multiple factors, including the families driving longer distances to reach their destinations, parents spending less time teaching their children to be as wary of traffic, and an increased risk of the parents accidentally driving over the children in their \"safe\" driveways and cul-de-sac streets.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5455743 Cul-de-Sacs: Suburban Dream or Dead End?], Morning Edition on NPR</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bettercities.net/article/tomorrow%E2%80%99s-cities-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-suburbs|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118041952/http://bettercities.net/article/tomorrow%E2%80%99s-cities-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-suburbs|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/06/07/cul-de-sacs-are-killing-us-public-safety-lessons-from-suburbia/|title=Cul-de-Sacs Are Killing Us: Public Safety Lessons From Suburbia|date=7 June 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTraditional street functions such as kids' play, strolling and socializing are incompatible with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts car traffic on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.\n\n===Pedestrian and bicycle movement===\n[[File:Paris Street Network Segment.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A 2&#215;2 km square segment of the street network of [[Paris]] that often, and erroneously, is characterized as a grid. It shows the highly irregular city blocks and the range of street orientations, both common attributes of many historic cities]]\nStreet networks of old cities that grew organically, though admired for being picturesque, can be confusing for visitors but rarely for the original inhabitants (see plan). Similarly confusing to visitors are the plans of modern subdivisions with discontinuous and curvilinear streets. Change of street orientation, particularly when gradual or arbitrary, cannot be \"mapped\" in the mind. Impasses, crescents or [[cul-de-sacs]] frustrate the traveler especially when they are long, forcing an arduous retracing of steps.\n\nFrequency of intersections, however, becomes also a disadvantage for pedestrians and bicycles. It disrupts the relaxed canter of walking and forces pedestrians repeatedly onto the road, a hostile, anxiety-generating territory. People with physical limitations or frailties, children and seniors for example, can find a regular walk challenging. For bicycles this disadvantage is accentuated as their normal speed is at least double that of pedestrians. Frequent stops negate the speed advantage and the physical benefit of bicycling and add to frustration. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Intersections are not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Most [[traffic collision]]s and injuries occur at intersections and the majority of the injuries to pedestrians crossing ''with'' the right of way.\n\nA dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as [[Vauban, Freiburg]] and [[Village Homes]], Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.\n\nExamining the issue of walkability, a recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a grid plan and conventional suburban layout in a [[fused grid]] layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of dedicated pedestrian paths. It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set, an environmental benefit.<ref>Xiongbing Jin (2010) \"Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods\", [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nPerceived and actual safety play a role in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an inaccurate reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents' decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured by the total number of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.\n\nRecent studies have found higher traffic fatality rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=1448007 | pmid=12948977 | volume=93 | issue=9 | title=Urban sprawl as a risk factor in motor vehicle occupant and pedestrian fatalities | year=2003 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1541\u20135 | last1 = Ewing | first1 = R | last2 = Schieber | first2 = RA | last3 = Zegeer | first3 = CV | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903234004/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 }}</ref> While some of this disparity is the result of distance from [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical]] facilities (hospitals are usually built in a fairly late stage of the development of a suburban area), it is clear{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} that the lower speeds encouraged by the frequency of intersections decrease the severity of accidents occurring on streets within a grid plan.\n\nAn earlier study<ref>Eran Ben-Joseph, Livability and Safety of Suburban Street Patterns: A Comparative Study (Berkeley, CA: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California, Working Paper 641, 1995)</ref> found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighborhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included culs-de-sac and crescents. The frequency of accidents was significantly higher in the grid neighborhoods.\n\nTwo newer studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study,<ref>Using Macrolevel Collision Prediction Models in Road SafetyPlanning Applications Gordon R.

While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase '''total and injurious crashes''' significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.\n\nStringent adherence to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology of the land is not taken into account. This may be unsafe for drivers, pedestrians and bicycles since it is more difficult to control speed and braking, particularly in winter conditions.\n\n===Reconstruction and development===\nOne of the greatest difficulties with grid plans is their lack of specialization, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city's main arteries. Often grid plans are found in [[Ribbon development|linear settlements]], with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their grid plans. Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.\n\n==Cities and towns with a grid plan==\n:{{Expand

'''grid street plan''', or '''gridiron plan''' is a type of [[city]] plan in which [[street]]s run at [[Angle#Types of angles|right angle]]s to each other, forming a [[wikt:grid|grid]]. The infrastructure cost for regular grid patterns is generally higher than for patterns with discontinuous streets.\n\nCosts for streets depend largely on four variables: street width, street length, [[city block|block]] width and pavement width. Two inherent characteristics of the grid plan, frequent intersections and orthogonal geometry, facilitate [[pedestrian]] movement. The geometry helps with orientation and [[wayfinding]] and its frequent intersections with the choice and directness of route to desired destinations.\n\nIn [[ancient Rome]], the grid plan method of land measurement was called [[centuriation]]. The grid plan dates from antiquity and originated in multiple cultures; some of the earliest [[planned cities]] were built using grid plans.\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient grid plans===\n[[File:Miletos stadsplan 400.jpg|thumb|right|The grid plan of [[Miletus]] in the Classical period]]\nBy 2600 BC, [[Mohenjo-daro]] and [[Harappa]], major cities of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], were built with blocks divided by a grid of straight streets, running north\u2013south and east\u2013west.

Many pyramid-cult cities used a common orientation: a north\u2013south axis from the royal palace and an east\u2013west axis from the temple, meeting at a central plaza where King and God merged and crossed.\n\n[[Hammurabi]] king of the [[Babylonia|Babylonian Empire]] in the 17th century BC, ordered the rebuilding of [[Babylon]]: constructing and restoring temples, city walls, public buildings, and irrigation canals. The streets of Babylon were wide and straight, intersected approximately at right angles, and were paved with bricks and [[bitumen]].\n\nThe tradition of grid plans is continuous in [[China]] from the 15th century BC onward in the [[Ancient Chinese urban planning|traditional urban planning]] of various ancient Chinese states. Guidelines put into written form in the [[Kaogongji]] during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (770-476 BC) stated: \"a capital city should be square on plan. Three gates on each side of the perimeter lead into the nine main streets that crisscross the city and define its grid-pattern. And for its layout the city should have the Royal Court situated in the south, the Marketplace in the north, the Imperial Ancestral Temple in the east and the Altar to the Gods of Land and Grain in the west.\"\n\n[[Teotihuacan]], near modern-day [[Mexico City]], is the largest ancient grid-plan site in the [[Americas]]. The city's grid covered 21 square kilometres(8 square miles).\n\nPerhaps the most well-known grid system is that spread through the colonies of the Roman Empire. The archetypal [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] was introduced to Italy first by the Greeks, with such information transferred by way of trade and conquest.<ref name=\"Stanislawski 116\">Stanislawski, Dan (1946).  \"The Grid-Pattern Town\", Geog. Rev., xxxvi, pp. 105-120, p. 116.</ref>\n\n====Ancient Greece====\nAlthough the idea of the grid was present in Hellenic societal and city planning, it was not pervasive prior to the 5th century BC. However, it slowly gained primacy through the work of [[Hippodamus of Miletus]], who planned and replanned many Greek cities in accordance with this form.<ref name=\"Burns 39\">Burns, Ross (2005), ''Damascus: A History'', Routledge, p. 39</ref> The concept of a grid as the ideal method of town planning had become widely accepted by the time of Alexander the Great. His conquests were a step in the propagation of the grid plan throughout colonies, some as far-flung as Taxila in Pakistan,<ref name=\"Burns 39\"/> that would later be mirrored by the expansion of the Roman Empire. The Greek grid had its streets aligned roughly in relation to the cardinal points<ref name=\"Burns 39\"/> and generally looked to take advantage of visual cues based on the hilly landscape typical of Greece and Asia Minor.<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\">Higgins, Hannah (2009) ''The Grid Book''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. p.60. {{ISBN|978-0-262-51240-4}}</ref> This was probably best exemplified in [[Priene]], in present-day western Turkey, where the orthogonal city grid was based on the cardinal points, on sloping terrain that struck views out{{clarify|date=July 2015}} towards a river and the city of [[Miletus]].<ref>Belozerskaya, Marina and Lapatin, Kenneth (2004), Ancient Greece: art, architecture, and history. Los Angeles: Getty Publications, p. 94.</ref>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n[[File:Mapa Caesaraugusta.svg|thumb| [[Caesaraugusta]] Roman city matching the current [[Zaragoza]] city map:<br />\n1.- Decumano; 2.- Cardo ; 3.- [[Foro romano de Caesaraugusta|Foro de Caesaraugusta]] ; 4.- [[Museo del Puerto Fluvial de Caesaraugusta|Puerto fluvial]]; 5.- [[Termas romanas de Caesaraugusta|Termas p\u00fablicas]]; 6.- [[Teatro romano de Caesaraugusta|Teatro]]; 7.- [[Muralla romana de Zaragoza|Muralla]]]]\n\nThe [[Etruscan people]], whose territories in Italy encompassed what would eventually become Rome, founded what is now the city of [[Marzabotto]] at the end of the 6th century BC. Its layout was based on Greek Ionic ideas, and it was here that the main east\u2013west and north\u2013south axes of a town (the ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' respectively) could first be seen in Italy. According to Stanislawski (1946), the Romans did use grids until the time of the late Republic or early Empire, when they introduced ''[[Roman centuriation|centuriation]]'', a system which they spread around the Mediterranean and into northern Europe later on.<ref name=\"Stanislawski 116\"/>\n[[File:Spirano-Stezzano.jpg|thumb|left|Straight road in the [[Province of Bergamo]], [[Italy]], following line of [[Roman centuriation|Roman Grid]] ]]\n\nThe military expansion of this period facilitated the adoption of the grid form as standard: the Romans established ''[[castra]]'' (forts or camps) first as military centres; some of them developed into administrative hubs. The Roman grid was similar in form to the Greek version of a grid, but allowed for practical considerations. For example, Roman ''castra'' were often sited on flat land, especially close to or on important nodes like river crossings or intersections of trade routes.<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> The dimensions of the ''castra'' were often standard, with each of its four walls generally having a length of {{convert|2150|ft|m|order=flip}}. Familiarity was the aim of such standardisation: soldiers could be stationed anywhere around the Empire, and orientation would be easy within established towns if they had a standard layout. Each would have the aforementioned ''[[decumanus maximus]]'' and ''[[cardo maximus]]'' at its heart, and their intersection would form the forum, around which would be sited important public buildings. Indeed, such was the degree of similarity between towns that Higgins states that soldiers \"would be housed at the same address as they moved from ''castra'' to ''castra''\".<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> Pompeii has been cited by both Higgins<ref name=\"Higgins, Hannah 2009 p. 60\"/> and Laurence<ref>Laurence, Ray (2007), ''Roman Pompeii: space and society'', p. 15-16.</ref>{{failed verification|date=February 2018}} as the best preserved example of the Roman grid.\n\nOutside of the castra, large tracts of land were also divided in accordance with the grid within the walls. These were typically {{convert|2400|ft|m|order=flip}} per side (called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''centuria'']]), and contained 100 parcels of land (each called [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|''heredium'']]).<ref name=\"Gelernter 15\">Gelernter, Mark (2001), ''A history of American architecture: buildings in their cultural and technological context'', p. 15.</ref> The ''decumanus maximus'' and ''cardo maximus'' extended from the town gates out towards neighbouring settlements. These were lined up to be as straight as possible, only deviating from their path due to natural obstacles that prevented a direct route.<ref name=\"Gelernter 15\"/>\n\nWhile the imposition of only one town form regardless of region could be seen as an imposition of imperial authority, there is no doubting the practical reasoning behind the formation of the Roman grid. Under Roman guidance, the grid was designed for efficiency and interchangeability, both facilitated by and aiding the expansion of their empire.\n\n===Asia from the first millennium AD===\nAs [[Japan]] and the [[Korean peninsula]] became politically centralized in the 7th century AD, those societies adopted Chinese grid-planning principles in numerous locations. In Korea, [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Unified Silla]], and [[Shangjing Longquanfu|Sanggyeong]], the capital of [[Balhae]], adapted the [[Tang Dynasty]] Chinese model. The ancient capitals of Japan, such as [[Fujiwara-kyo|Fujiwara-Ky\u00f4]] (AD 694-710), [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (Heij\u00f4-Ky\u00f4, AD 710-784), and [[Kyoto]] (Heian-Ky\u00f4, AD 794-1868) also adapted from Tang's capital, [[Chang'an]]. However, for reasons of defense, the planners of [[Tokyo]] eschewed the grid, opting instead for an irregular network of streets surrounding the [[Edo Castle]] grounds. In later periods, some parts of Tokyo were grid-planned, but grid plans are generally rare in Japan, and the [[Japanese addressing system]] is accordingly based on increasingly fine subdivisions, rather than a grid.\n\nThe grid-planning tradition in Asia continued through the beginning of the 20th century, with [[Sapporo]], Japan (est. 1868) following a grid plan under American influence.\n\n===Europe and its colonies (12th-17th centuries)===\n[[File:Sch\u00e9ma bastide mod\u00e8le Gascon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bastide]] schema in [[Gascony]]]]\nNew [[Europe]]an towns were planned using grids beginning in the 12th century, most prodigiously in the [[bastides]] of southern [[France]] that were built during the 13th and 14th centuries. Medieval European [[new town]]s using grid plans were widespread, ranging from [[Wales]] to the [[Florence|Florentine]] region. Many were built on ancient grids originally established as Roman colonial outposts. In the British Isles, the planned new town system involving a grid street layout was part of the system of [[burgage]].\n\nThe Roman model was also used in Spanish settlements during the [[Reconquista]] of Ferdinand and Isabella. It was subsequently applied in the new cities established during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], after the founding of [[San Crist\u00f3bal de La Laguna]] (Canary Islands) in 1496. In 1573, King Phillip II of Spain compiled the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041215070244/http://www.arc.miami.edu/Law%20of%20Indies.html Laws of the Indies] to guide the construction and administration of colonial communities. The Laws specified a square or rectangular central plaza with eight principal streets running from the plaza's corners. Hundreds of grid-plan communities throughout the Americas were established according to this pattern, echoing the practices of earlier Indian civilizations.\n\nThe [[baroque]] capital city of [[Malta]], [[Valletta]], dating back to the 16th Century, was built following a rigid grid plan of uniformly designed houses, dotted with palaces, churches and squares.\n\nThe grid plan became popular with the start of the [[Renaissance]] in Northern Europe. In 1606, the newly founded city of [[Mannheim]] in [[Germany]] was the first Renaissance city laid out on the grid plan. Later came the New Town in [[Edinburgh]] and almost the entire city centre of [[Glasgow]], and many [[Planned community|planned communities]] and cities in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\n[[Derry]], constructed in 1613\u20131618, was the first [[planned city]] in [[Ireland]]. The central diamond within a walled city with four gates was considered a good design for defence. The grid pattern was widely copied in the colonies of [[British North America]].\n\n=== Russia (18th century) ===\n[[File:Homann MapSpb1716-17.png|thumb|The map of St. Petersburg (1717). The grid of 'lines' and 'prospekts' is seen across the whole rectangular [[Vasilyevsky Island]], while actually only the eastern part was built]]\nIn [[Russia]] the first [[planned city]] was [[St. Petersburg]] founded in 1703 by [[Peter the Great|Peter I]]. Being aware of the modern European construction experience which he examined in the years of his [[Grand Embassy of Peter the Great|Grand Embassy to Europe]], czar ordered [[Domenico Trezzini]] to elaborate the first general plan of the city. The project of this architect for [[Vasilyevsky Island]] was a typical rectangular grid of streets (originally intended to be canals, like in [[Amsterdam]]), with three lengthwise thoroughfares, rectangularly crossed with about 30 crosswise streets.\n\nThe shape of street blocks on [[Vasilyevsky Island]] is the same, as was later implemented in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] for [[Manhattan]]: elongated rectangles. The longest side of each block faces the relatively narrow street with a numeric name (in Petersburg they are called [[Lines of Vasilyevsky Island|''Liniya'' (Line)]]) while the shortest side faces wide avenues. To denote avenues in Petersburg, a special term ''[[Prospekt (street)|prospekt]]'' was introduced. Inside the grid of Vasilyevsky Island there are three prospekts, named ''Bolshoi'' (''Big''), ''Sredniy ''(''Middle'') and ''Maly'' (''Small'') while the far ends of each lines cross with the embankments of [[Bolshaya Neva River|Bolshaya Neva]] and [[Smolenka River|Smolenka]] rivers in the delta of the [[Neva River]].\n\nThe peculiarity of 'lines' (streets) naming in this grid is that are each side of street has its own number, so one 'line' is a side of a street, not the whole street. The numbering is latently zero-based, however the supposed \"zero line\" has its proper name ''Kadetskaya liniya'', while the opposite side of this street is called the '1-st Line'. Next street is named the '2-nd Line' on the eastern side, and the '3-rd Line' on the western side. After the reorganization of house numbering in 1834 and 1858 the even house numbers are used on the odd-numbered lines, and respectively odd house numbers are used for the even-numbered lines. The maximum numbers for 'lines' in Petersburg are 28-29th lines.\n\nLater in the middle of the 18th century another grid of rectangular blocks with the numbered streets appeared in the continental part of the city: 13 streets named from the '1-st Rota' up to the '13-th Rota', where the [[Company (military unit)|companies]] ({{lang-de|Rotte}}, {{lang-ru|\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0430}}) of the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment]] were located.\n\n===Early United States (17th-19th centuries)===\n[[File:Grid 1811.jpg|thumb|left|[[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] for [[Manhattan]]|344x344px]][[File:Savannah Portland NewYork City Blocks.svg|right|thumb|A diagram of three U.S. city grids at the same scale showing the differences in dimensions and configuration]][[File:American Grid Comparison.jpg|thumbnail|left|Twenty American grids compared at the same scale]][[File:Map of the Original City of Philadelphia in 1682 by Thomas Holme.jpg|thumb|Map of the Original City of Philadelphia in 1682 by Thomas Holme]]\nMany of the earliest cities in the United States, such as [[Boston]], did not start with a grid system.<ref>[[Back Bay]], [[Dorchester Heights]], and [[South Boston]] all have grid layouts.</ref> However, even in pre-revolutionary days some cities saw the benefits of such a layout. [[New Haven Colony]], one of the earliest colonies in America, was designed with a tiny 9-square grid at its founding in 1638.

As the United States expanded westward, grid-based city planning modeled off of Philadelphia's layout would become popular among frontier cities, making grids ubiquitous across the country.<ref>http://www.thegreatamericangrid.com/archives/777</ref>\n\nAnother well-known grid plan is the plan for [[New York City]] formulated in the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]], a proposal by the state [[legislature]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] for the development of most of [[Manhattan]]<ref>Landers, John ''Twelve Historical New York City Street and Transit Maps from 1860 to 1967'' {{ISBN|1-882608-16X}}</ref> above [[Houston Street]].\n\n[[Washington, D.C.]], the capital of the [[United States]], was planned under [[French-American]] architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]. Under the L'Enfant plan, the original [[District of Columbia]] was developed using a grid plan that is interrupted by diagonal avenues, most famously [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]]. These diagonals are often connected by [[traffic circle]]s, such as [[Dupont Circle]] and [[Washington Circle]]. As the city grew, the plan was duplicated to cover most of the remainder of the capital. Meanwhile, the core of the city faced disarray and the [[McMillan Plan]], led by Senator [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]], was adopted to build a [[National Mall]] and a parks system that is still today a jewel of the city.\n\nOften, some of the streets in a grid are numbered (First, Second, etc.), lettered, or arranged in alphabetical order. Downtown [[San Diego]] uses all three schemes: north\u2013south streets are numbered from west to east, and east\u2013west streets are split between a lettered series running southward from A through L and a series of streets named after trees or plants, running northward alphabetically from Ash to Walnut. As in many cities, some of these streets have been given new names violating the system (the former D Street is now Broadway, the former 12th Avenue is now Park Boulevard, etc.); this has meant that 2nd, not 1st, is the most common street name in the United States.<ref>[http://www.nlc.org/build-skills-and-networks/resources/cities-101/city-factoids/most-common-us-street-names NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES: Most Common U.S. Street Names at nlc.org] Accessed 16 May 2017</ref>\n\nAn exception to the typical, uniform grid is the plan of [[Savannah, Georgia]] (1733), known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]]. It is a composite, cellular city block consisting of four large corner blocks, four small blocks in between and a public square in the centre; the entire composition of approximately ten acres (four hectares) is known as a ward.<ref>Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan''. University of Virginia Press, 2012.</ref> Its cellular structure includes all the primary land uses of a neighborhood and has for that reason been called [[fractal]].<ref>Batty, M. & Longley, P. (1994) Fractal Cities: A Geometry of Form and Function (San Diego, Calif.: Academic)</ref>  Its street configuration presages modern traffic calming techniques applied to uniform grids where certain selected streets become discontinuous or narrow, thus discouraging through traffic. The configuration also represents an example of functional [[shared space]], where pedestrian and vehicular traffic can safely and comfortably coexist.<ref>Wilson, T. ''The Oglethorpe Plan'', p. 175</ref>\n\nIn the westward development of the United States, the use of the grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in [[Salt Lake City]] (1870), [[Dodge City]] (1872) and [[Oklahoma City]] (1890). In these western cities the streets were numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.<ref name=\"crabgrass\" />\n\nOne of the main advantages of the grid plan was that it allowed the rapid [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]] and [[auction]] of a large parcel of land. For example, when the legislature of the [[Republic of Texas]] decided in 1839 to move the capital to a new site along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], the functioning of the government required the rapid population of the town, which was named [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Charged with the task, [[Edwin Waller]] designed a fourteen-block grid that fronted the river on 640 acres (exactly 1 square mile; about 2.6&nbsp;km\u00b2). After surveying the land, Waller organized the almost immediate sale of 306 lots, and by the end of the year the entire Texas government had arrived by [[cart|oxcart]] at the new site. Apart from the speed of surveying advantage, the rationale at the time of the grid's adoption in this and other cities remains obscure.\n\n===Early 19th century \u2013 Australasia===\nIn 1836 [[William Light]] drew up his plans for [[Adelaide, South Australia]], spanning the [[River Torrens]].

This grid of streets, laid out when there were only a few hundred settlers, became the nucleus for what is now a city of over 5 million people, the city of Melbourne. The unusual dimensions of the allotments and the incorporation of narrow 'little' streets were the result of compromise between Hoddle's desire to employ the regulations established in 1829 by previous [[New South Wales]] Governor Ralph Darling, requiring square blocks and wide, spacious streets and Bourke's desire for rear access ways (now the 'little' streets, for example [[Little Collins Street]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Miles|title=Melbourne: The City's History and Development|date=1995|publisher=City of Melbourne|location=Melbourne|pages=25-29}}</ref>\n\nThe city of [[Christchurch Central City|Christchurch]], New Zealand, was planned by [[Edward Jollie]] in 1850.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf | title = Contextual Historical Overview for Christchurch City| type = PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522213304/http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf|date=June 2005|archive-date=22May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Late 19th century to the present===\n[[File:BCN01.JPG|thumb|[[Barcelona]]]]\n[[File:Original design of Barcelona's city blocks.svg|right|thumb|The city blocks and streets of Barcelona as conceived by Ildefonso Cerd\u00e1.

These areas represent the original land dimensions of the founded city, generally around one square mile. Some cities expanded the grid further out from the centre, but maps also show that, in general, as the distance from the centre increases, a variety of patterns emerge in no particular discernible order. In juxtaposition to the grid they appear random. These new patterns have been systematically classified and their design characteristics measured.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Southworth | first1 = Michael | last2 = Owens | first2 = Peter | lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1993 | title = The Evolving Metropolis: Studies of Community, Neighbourhood, and Street Form at the Urban Edge | url = | journal = JAPA | volume = 59 | issue = 3| pages = 271\u2013288 | doi=10.1080/01944369308975880}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the grid system was widely used in most major cities and their [[suburb]]s until the 1960s. However, during the 1920s, the rapid adoption of the [[automobile]] caused a panic among [[urban planning|urban planners]], who, based on observation, claimed that speeding cars would eventually kill tens of thousands of small children per year. Apparently, at this early stage of the car's entry into the grid, the streets of major cities worldwide were the scene of virtual \"slaughter\" as the fatality rate in proportion to population was more than double the current rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factbook.net/EGRF_Regional_analyses_HMCs.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165123/http://www.factbook.net/EGRF_Regional_analyses_HMCs.htm |archivedate=2010-07-04 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp6/pdfdocs/RAS_2007.pdf Statistics of Road Traffic Accidents in Europe and North America Published: January 2007 or Published: April 2007] Accessed 17 May 2017</ref> In 2009, after several decades of road safety improvements and a continuous decline in fatalities, an estimated 33,963 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes and, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \"Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children from 3 to 14 years old.\"<ref>[http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811291.PDF Early Estimate of Motor Vehicle Traffic Fatalities in 2009 at crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov] Accessed 16 May 2017</ref> Planners, therefore, called for an inwardly focused \"[[City block#Superblock|superblock]]\" arrangement that minimized through automobile traffic and discouraged cars from traveling on anything but [[arterial road]]s; traffic generators, such as apartment complexes and shops, would be restricted to the edges of the superblock, along the arterial. This paradigm prevailed between about 1930 and 1960, especially in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], where notable examples include [[Leimert Park, Los Angeles, California|Leimert Park]] (an early example) and [[Panorama City, Los Angeles, California|Panorama City]] (a late-period one).\n\n[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ouagadougou]] ([[Burkina Faso]], ex [[Republic of Upper Volta|Upper Volta]], [[Africa]]), 1930]]A prominent 20th century urbanist, [[Lewis Mumford]], severely criticized some of the grid's characteristics: \"With a T-square and a triangle, finally, the municipal engineer could, without the slightest training as either an architect or a sociologist, 'plan' a metropolis, with its standard lots, its standard blocks, its standard street widths, in short, with its standardized comparable, and replaceable parts. The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty.\"<ref>[[Lewis Mumford|Mumford, Lewis]] (1961) ''The City in History: Its Origins, Its Transformation, and Its Prospects''. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. p.425.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, [[Traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineers]] and urban planners abandoned the grid virtually wholesale in favor of a \"[[street hierarchy]]\". This is a thoroughly \"asymmetric\" street arrangement in which a residential subdivision\u2014often surrounded by a [[Noise barrier|noise wall]] or a [[gated community|security gate]]\u2014is completely separated from the road network except for one or two connections to arterial roads. In a way, this is a return to [[medieval]] styles: as noted in [[Spiro Kostof]]'s seminal history of [[urban design]], ''The City Shaped'', there is a strong resemblance between the street arrangements of modern American suburbs and those of medieval [[Arab]] and [[Moorish]] cities. In each case, the community unit at hand\u2014the clan or extended family in the [[Muslim]] world, the economically homogeneous [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] in modern suburbia\u2014isolates itself from the larger urban scene by using dead ends and ''[[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]]''.\n[[File:Milton Keynes Sector.jpg|right|thumb|A one km<sup>2</sup> sector in [[Milton Keynes]] framed by major roads in a grid configuration. The road network within the sector uses cul-de-sac streets complemented by bike and foot paths which connect the entire sector and beyond.]]\n\n====Milton Keynes====\n{{Main|Milton Keynes grid road system}}\nOne famous grid system is in the British new town of [[Milton Keynes]]. In this planned city, which began construction in 1967, a system of ten \"horizontal\" (roughly east\u2013west) and eleven \"vertical\" (roughly north\u2013south) roads was used, with [[roundabout]]s at each intersection. The horizontal roads were all given names ending in 'way' and H numbers (for 'horizontal', e.g. H3 Monks Way). The vertical roads were given names ending in 'street' and V numbers (for 'vertical', e.g. [[V6 Grafton Street]]). Each grid road was spaced roughly one kilometre along from the next, forming squares of approximately one square kilometre. Each square and each roundabout was given its own name. The system provided very easy transport within the city, although it confused visitors who were unfamiliar with the system. The grid squares thus formed are far larger than the city blocks described earlier, and the road layouts within the grid squares are generally 'organic' in form \u2013 matching the street hierarchy model described above.\n\n== Benefits and criticisms ==\n\n===Financial cost===\n[[File:Block Sizes and Street Length.svg|thumb|right|Block sizes and street length]]\n[[File:13\u00bd Street.jpg|thumb|right|In a numbered grid system, adding an extra street can cause confusion]]\n\n''Street width'', or right of way (ROW), influences the amount of land that is devoted to streets, which becomes unavailable for development and therefore represents an opportunity cost. The wider the street, the higher the opportunity cost. Street width is determined by circulation and aesthetic considerations and is not dependent on the pattern configuration. Any configuration can have wide or narrow streets.\n\n''Street length'' influences proportionately the amount of street components that have to be constructed such as pavement, curbs and sidewalks, storm sewers and drains, light poles, and trees. The street length of a given area of development depends on the frequency at which streets occur which in turn depends on the length and width of a block. The higher the frequency of streets the longer is their total length. The smaller the block dimensions the higher the frequency of the streets. As the frequency of street increases so does the number of intersections. Intersections normally cost more than straight street length because they are labour-intensive and require street and traffic signage.\n\n''Pavement width'' influences the cost by affecting the amount of materials and labour required to provide a finished road surface. Pavement width is generally based on traffic engineering considerations and is not dependent on pattern configuration. As with the street width, any pattern can have wide or narrow pavements.\nOf all three factors that affect cost, street width, street length and pavement width, only street length is pattern dependent. An objective cost comparison would, therefore, rely on this variable with the full understanding that the other variables, though optional, can play a role.\n\nTraditional orthogonal grid patterns generally have greater street frequencies than discontinuous patterns. For example, Portland's block is 200 feet \u00d7 200 feet while Miletus' is half that size and Timgad's half again (see diagram). Houston, Sacramento and Barcelona are progressively bigger reaching up to four times the area of Portland's block. New York's 1811 plan (see above) has blocks of {{convert|200|ft}}. in width and variable lengths ranging from about 500 to 900 feet. The corresponding frequency of streets for each of these block sizes affects the street length.\n\nA simple example of a grid street pattern (see diagram) illustrates the progressive reduction in ''total'' street length (the sum of all individual street lengths) and the corresponding increase in block length. For a corresponding reduction of one, two, three and four streets within this {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} parcel, the street length is reduced from an original total of 12,600 to 7,680 linear feet, a 39% reduction. Simultaneously, block lengths increase from 200 \u00d7 200 feet to 1240 \u00d7 200 feet. When all five blocks have reached the ultimate size of {{convert|1240 |feet}} four street lengths out of total eight have been eliminated. Block lengths of 1000 feet or larger rarely appear in grid plans and are not recommended as they hinder pedestrian movement (Pedestrianism, below). From the pedestrian perspective, the smaller the block is, the easier the navigation and the more direct the route. Consequently, the finer grids are preferred.\n\nPatterns that incorporate discontinuous street types such as crescents and [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]] have not, in general, regarded pedestrian movement as a priority and, consequently, have produced blocks that are usually in the 1000-foot range and often exceed it. As a result, street frequency drops and so does the ''total'' street length and, therefore, the cost. In general, it is not the street pattern per se that affects costs but the frequency of streets that it either necessitates or purposely incorporates.\n\nAn inherent advantage of the orthogonal geometry of a proper grid is its tendency to yield regular lots in well-packed sequences. This maximizes the use of the land of the block; it does not, however, affect street frequency. Any frequency of orthogonal streets produces the same [[packing problems|packing]] effect. Orthogonal geometry also minimizes disputes over lot boundaries and maximizes the number of lots that could front a given street. [[John Randal]] said Manhattan's grid plan facilitated \"buying, selling and improving real estate\".<ref name=\"crabgrass\" />\n\nAnother important aspect of street grids and the use of rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs to look over their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.\n\n===Ecological features, rain water absorption, and pollutant generation===\n[[File:Platslc.jpg|thumb|right|Surveyor's plan of Salt Lake City, circa 1870s - an example of a typical, uniform, square-grid street network]]\nTypical uniform grids are unresponsive to [[topography]]. [[Priene]]'s plan, for example, is set on a hill side and most of its north\u2013south streets are stepped, a feature that would have made them inaccessible to carts, chariots and loaded animals. Many modern cities, such as [[San Francisco]], [[Vancouver]], and [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], follow Priene's example, ''e.g.''. In a modern context, steep grades limit accessibility by car, and more so by bicycle, on foot, or wheelchair, particularly in cold climates.\n\nThe same inflexibility of the grid leads to disregarding [[Natural environment|environment]]ally sensitive areas such as small streams and [[creek (stream)|creeks]] or mature woodlots in preference for the application of the immutable geometry. It is said of the NY grid plan that it flattened all obstacles in its way. By contrast, recent discontinuous street patterns follow the configuration of natural features without disrupting them. The grid represents a rationalist, [[reductionist]] solution to a multifaceted issue.\n\nThe grid's inherent high street and intersection frequencies produce large areas of [[impermeable surface]]s in the street pavement and the [[sidewalk]]s. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of [[rain|rain water]] on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty is compounded by the grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.\n\nSome cities, notably [[Seattle]], have devised means to improve a street's retention capacity. However, frequent intersections as they occur in a regular grid would pose an obstacle to their effective application.\n\nA street network pattern can affect the production of pollutants by the amount of car travel that it necessitates and the speed at which cars can travel. The grid plan with its frequent intersections may displace a portion of the local car trips with walking or biking due to the directness of route that it offers to [[pedestrian]]s. But it also makes the same routes more direct for cars, which could be an enticement for driving. The potential car trip displacement would result in a reduction of [[pollutant]] [[exhaust gas|emissions]]. The advantage of the intersection density for pedestrians, however, can have a contrary effect for cars due to its potential for reducing speeds. Low speeds below 20&nbsp;mph have a significantly higher coefficient of pollutant production than above 30, though the coefficient after leveling off tends to increase gradually after 50&nbsp;mph.<ref>Final Facility Specific Speed Correction Factors:M6.SPD.002 David Brzezinski, Constance Hart, Phil Enns Assessment and Standards Division, Office of Transportation and Air Quality, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</ref> This effect is accentuated with high traffic density in areas with commercial uses where speeds come to a crawl. Since the grid plan is non-hierarchical and intersections are frequent, all streets can be subject to this potential reduction of average speeds, leading to a high production of pollutants. Greenhouse and noxious gases can be detrimental to the environment and to resident health.\n\n===Social environment and security===\n\nIn his seminal study (1982) on livable streets that was conducted in neighbourhoods with a grid, Donald Appleyard showed that social networking and street playing degraded as traffic increased on a street. His research provided the groundwork for [[traffic calming]] and for several initiatives such as [[living street]]s and [[Home Zone]]s, all of which are aimed at improving a street's social milieu. The amount of traffic on a street depends on variables such as the population density of the neighbourhood, car ownership and its proximity to commercial, institutional or recreational edifices. Most importantly, however, it depends on whether a street is or could become a through road to a destination. As a through road, it could sustain unpredictable levels of traffic that may fluctuate during the day and increase over time.\n\nA key characteristic of the grid pattern is that any and all streets are equally accessible to traffic (non-hierarchical) and could be chosen at will as alternative routes to a destination. Cut-through driving, or shortcutting, has been resisted by residents.<ref>Philip Langdon, 2006: Seaside Stews Over Street Connections. ''New Urban News'', September 2006</ref> Cities responded by making modifications to prevent it. Current recommended design practice suggests the use of 3-way intersections to alleviate it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |title=Traditional Neighborhood Development Street Design Guidelines |publisher=[[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] |date=October 1999 |location=Washington, DC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220174833/http://www.cues.fau.edu/cnu/docs/Traditional_Neighborhood_Development_Street_Design_Guidelines-ITE.pdf |archive-date=February 20, 2011 |access-date=May 23, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nThe geometry of the normal, open grid is evidently unsuitable for protecting or enhancing the social environment of a street from the negative influence of traffic. Similarly, a 1972 ground-breaking study by Oscar Newman on a [[Defensible Space Theory]] described ways to improve the social environment and security of neighbourhoods and streets. In a practical application of his theory at Five Oaks, the neighbourhood's grid pattern was modified to prevent through traffic and create identifiable smaller enclaves while maintaining complete pedestrian freedom of movement. The positive outcome of these changes reinforces Appleyard's findings and the need to reduce or prevent through traffic on neighbourhood streets; a need that cannot be met with a typical, uniform, open grid.\n\nThe question of neighbourhood security has been a constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this disputed issue. A recent study<ref>Hillier, Bill and Sahbaz, Ozlem (March 2008) \"An evidence based approach to crime and urban design Or, can we have vitality, sustainability and security all at once?\" Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, [[University College London]]</ref> did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs\u2013de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear cul-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.\n\nA recent study in California<ref>Handy, Susan; Sommer, Samantha; Ogilvie, Julie; Cao, Xinyu; and Mokhtarian, Patricia (2007) \"Cul-de-Sacs and Children's Outdoor Play: Quantitative and Qualitative Evidence\" [[University of California, Davis]]</ref> examined the amount of child play that occurred on the streets of neighbourhoods with different characteristics; grid pattern and culs-de-sac. The findings indicate that the open grid streets showed substantially lower play activity than the cul-de-sac street type. Culs-de-sac reduce [[Perceived risk|perceived danger]] from traffic, and thereby encourage more outdoor play.  It pointed the way toward the development of hybrid street network patterns that improve pedestrian movement but restrict cut-through driving.

As a result of this misperception of risk, children living in cul-de-sac communities are more likely to be killed by vehicles.  This increased risk of death is due to multiple factors, including the families driving longer distances to reach their destinations, parents spending less time teaching their children to be as wary of traffic, and an increased risk of the parents accidentally driving over the children in their \"safe\" driveways and cul-de-sac streets.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5455743 Cul-de-Sacs: Suburban Dream or Dead End?], Morning Edition on NPR</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bettercities.net/article/tomorrow%E2%80%99s-cities-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-suburbs|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118041952/http://bettercities.net/article/tomorrow%E2%80%99s-cities-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-suburbs|archive-date=2017-01-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/06/07/cul-de-sacs-are-killing-us-public-safety-lessons-from-suburbia/|title=Cul-de-Sacs Are Killing Us: Public Safety Lessons From Suburbia|date=7 June 2011|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTraditional street functions such as kids' play, strolling and socializing are incompatible with traffic flow, which the open, uniform grid geometry encourages. For these reasons, cities such as [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], among many others, transformed existing residential streets part of a grid plan into permeable, linked culs-de-sac. This transformation retains the [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|permeability]] and connectivity of the grid for the active modes of transport but filters and restricts car traffic on the cul-de-sac street to residents only.\n\n===Pedestrian and bicycle movement===\n[[File:Paris Street Network Segment.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|A 2&#215;2 km square segment of the street network of [[Paris]] that often, and erroneously, is characterized as a grid. It shows the highly irregular city blocks and the range of street orientations, both common attributes of many historic cities]]\nStreet networks of old cities that grew organically, though admired for being picturesque, can be confusing for visitors but rarely for the original inhabitants (see plan). Similarly confusing to visitors are the plans of modern subdivisions with discontinuous and curvilinear streets. Change of street orientation, particularly when gradual or arbitrary, cannot be \"mapped\" in the mind. Impasses, crescents or [[cul-de-sacs]] frustrate the traveler especially when they are long, forcing an arduous retracing of steps.\n\nFrequency of intersections, however, becomes also a disadvantage for pedestrians and bicycles. It disrupts the relaxed canter of walking and forces pedestrians repeatedly onto the road, a hostile, anxiety-generating territory. People with physical limitations or frailties, children and seniors for example, can find a regular walk challenging. For bicycles this disadvantage is accentuated as their normal speed is at least double that of pedestrians. Frequent stops negate the speed advantage and the physical benefit of bicycling and add to frustration. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Intersections are not only unpleasant but also dangerous. Most [[traffic collision]]s and injuries occur at intersections and the majority of the injuries to pedestrians crossing ''with'' the right of way.\n\nA dilemma arises from trying to meet important planning objectives when using the grid: pedestrianism, cost efficiency and environmental responsiveness. To serve pedestrians well, a rectangular configuration and high frequency of streets and intersections is the preferred route, which the orthogonal grid geometry provides. To reduce development costs and environmental impact, lower frequency of streets is the logical path. Since these two design objectives are contradictory a balance needs to be struck. Such balance has been achieved in leading modern projects such as [[Vauban, Freiburg]] and [[Village Homes]], Davis. Both score high in pedestrian and bike mode share and, at the same time, in reducing negative development externalities. Their layout configurations represent a fusion of the classic grid plan with recent street network patterns.\n\nExamining the issue of walkability, a recent comparison of seven neighbourhood layouts found a 43 and 32 percent increase in walking with respect to a grid plan and conventional suburban layout in a [[fused grid]] layout, which has greater permeability for pedestrians than for cars due to its inclusion of dedicated pedestrian paths. It also showed a 7 to 10 percent range of reduction in driving with respect to the remainder six neighbourhood layouts in the set, an environmental benefit.<ref>Xiongbing Jin (2010) \"Modeling the Influence of Neighbourhood Design on Daily Trip Patterns in Urban Neighbourhoods\", [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]]</ref>\n\n===Safety===\nPerceived and actual safety play a role in the use of the street. Perceived safety, though perhaps an inaccurate reflection of the number of injuries or fatalities, influences parents' decision to allow their children to play, walk or bike on the street. Actual levels of safety as measured by the total number of collisions and the number and severity of injuries are a matter of public concern. Both should inform the layout, if the street network is to achieve its optimum use.\n\nRecent studies have found higher traffic fatality rates in outlying suburban areas than in central cities and inner suburbs with smaller blocks and more-connected street patterns.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc=1448007 | pmid=12948977 | volume=93 | issue=9 | title=Urban sprawl as a risk factor in motor vehicle occupant and pedestrian fatalities | year=2003 | journal=Am J Public Health | pages=1541\u20135 | last1 = Ewing | first1 = R | last2 = Schieber | first2 = RA | last3 = Zegeer | first3 = CV | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.9.1541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903234004/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2002/lucy-april-30-2002.html |archivedate=2006-09-03 }}</ref> While some of this disparity is the result of distance from [[Emergency medical services|emergency medical]] facilities (hospitals are usually built in a fairly late stage of the development of a suburban area), it is clear{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} that the lower speeds encouraged by the frequency of intersections decrease the severity of accidents occurring on streets within a grid plan.\n\nAn earlier study<ref>Eran Ben-Joseph, Livability and Safety of Suburban Street Patterns: A Comparative Study (Berkeley, CA: Institute of Urban and Regional Development, University of California, Working Paper 641, 1995)</ref> found significant differences in recorded accidents between residential neighborhoods that were laid out on a grid and those that included culs-de-sac and crescents. The frequency of accidents was significantly higher in the grid neighborhoods.\n\nTwo newer studies examined the frequency of collisions in two regional districts using the latest analytical tools. They investigated the potential correlation between street network patterns and frequency of collisions. In one study,<ref>Using Macrolevel Collision Prediction Models in Road SafetyPlanning Applications Gordon R. Lovegrove and Tarek Sayed Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board, No. 1950, Transportation Research Board of the National Academies, Washington, D.C., 2006, pp. 73\u201382</ref> cul-de-sac networks appeared to be much safer than grid networks, by nearly three to one.\nA second study<ref>Sun, J. & Lovegrove, G. (2009). Research Study on Evaluating the Level of Safety of the Fused Grid Road Pattern, External Research Project for CMHC, Ottawa, Ontario</ref> found the grid plan to be the least safe by a significant margin with respect to all other street patterns.\n\nA 2009 study<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dumbaugh | first1 = Eric | last2 = Rae | first2 = Robert | year = 2009 | title = Safe Urban Form: Revisiting the Relationship Between Community Design and Traffic Safety | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 309\u2013329 | doi = 10.1080/01944360902950349 }}</ref> suggests that land use patterns play a significant role in traffic safety and should be considered in conjunction with the network pattern. While all intersection types in general reduce the incidence of fatal crashes, four-way intersections, which occur regularly in a grid, increase '''total and injurious crashes''' significantly. The study recommends hybrid street networks with dense concentrations of T-intersections and concludes that a return to the 19th century gridiron is undesirable.\n\nStringent adherence to the grid plan can cause steep inclines since the topology of the land is not taken into account. This may be unsafe for drivers, pedestrians and bicycles since it is more difficult to control speed and braking, particularly in winter conditions.\n\n===Reconstruction and development===\nOne of the greatest difficulties with grid plans is their lack of specialization, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city's main arteries. Often grid plans are found in [[Ribbon development|linear settlements]], with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their grid plans. Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.\n\n==Cities and towns with a grid plan==\n:{{Expand section|date=June 2017|section=}}\n{{unsourced-section|date=July 2019}}\n=== North America ===\n\n==== United States====\n*[[Anniston, Alabama]]\n*[[Charlotte, North Carolina]]\n*[[Chicago]]\n*[[Cincinnati]]\n*[[Holyoke]]\n*[[Indianapolis]]\n*[[Miami]]\n*[[Milwaukee]]\n*[[Minneapolis]]\n*[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\n*[[New York City]] (See [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]])\n*[[Oklahoma City]]\n*[[Omaha, Nebraska]]\n*[[Orlando]]\n*[[Panorama City]]\n*[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]\n*[[Portland, OR|Portland]]\n*[[Philadelphia]]\n*[[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]\n*[[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] \n*[[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]\n*[[Salt Lake City]]\n*[[San Francisco]]\n*[[San Jose, California]]\n*[[Seattle]] (See [[Street layout of Seattle]])\n*[[Savannah, GA|Savannah]] (See [[Oglethorpe Plan]])\n*[[Traverse City, Michigan|Traverse City]]\n*[[Tucson]]\n*[[Tulsa, OK]]\n*[[Washington D.C.]] (See [[L'Enfant Plan]])\n*[[Wichita, KS]]\n*[[Windermere, Florida|Windermere]]\n*[[Winter Park, FL]]\n\n==== Canada ====\n*[[Calgary]]\n*[[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]]\n*[[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]\n*[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] \n*[[London, Ontario]]\n*[[Montreal]] \n*[[Oshawa, Ontario]]\n*[[Ottawa]]\n*[[Quebec City, Quebec]]\n*[[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]\n*[[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]]\n*[[Saskatoon]]\n*[[Sudbury, Ontario]]\n*[[Thunder Bay, Ontario]]\n*[[Toronto]]\n*[[Vancouver]]\n*[[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]]\n*[[Winnipeg]]\n*[[Victoria, BC|Victoria]]\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n*[[Barcelona]]\n*[[Derry]]\n*[[Glasgow]]\n*[[Mannheim]]\n*[[Milton Keynes]] ([[Milton Keynes grid road system]])\n*[[New Town, Edinburgh]]\n*[[Newtown Pery, Limerick]]\n*[[Plymouth]]\n*[[Turin]]\n*[[Milan]], partially with the Beruto plan\n*[[Reggio Calabria]]\n*[[Messina]]\n*[[Valletta]]\n*[[Naples]]\n*[[Elburg]]\n\n=== Oceania ===\n==== Australia ====\n[[File:HOD1.png|thumb|Schematic plan of Hoddle's allotments for the village of [[Melbourne, Victoria, Australia]], March 1837]]\n*[[Adelaide]] (See [[Light's Vision]])\n*[[Ballarat]]\n*[[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]]\n*[[Cairns]]\n*[[Hobart]]\n*[[Melbourne]] (See [[Hoddle Grid]])\n*[[Newcastle, New South Wales]] (See [[Dangar Grid]])\n*[[Sydney]] suburbs of [[Smithfield, New South Wales|Smithfield]], [[Austral, New South Wales|Austral]], [[Auburn, New South Wales|Auburn]] and [[Canley Heights]] in the [[Greater Western Sydney|greater west]]\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n*[[Christchurch]]\n\n=== Africa ===\n==== Egypt ====\n*[[Alexandria]]\n\n==== Senegal ====\n*[[Dakar]]\n\n=== Asia ===\n==== Japan ====\n*[[Nagoya]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xn--7orpdr10a.tokyo/2018/09/07/%E5%90%8D%E5%8F%A4%E5%B1%8B%E3%81%AE%E9%81%93%E8%B7%AF%E3%81%AF%E7%B7%9A%E7%8A%B6-the-linear-roads-of-nagoya/ |title=The linear roads of Nagoya |website=\u540d\u53e4\u5c4b.tokyo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180912183207/http://xn--7orpdr10a.tokyo/2018/09/07/%E5%90%8D%E5%8F%A4%E5%B1%8B%E3%81%AE%E9%81%93%E8%B7%AF%E3%81%AF%E7%B7%9A%E7%8A%B6-the-linear-roads-of-nagoya/ |archive-date=2018-09-12 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Sapporo]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robson |first1=Daniel |title=Sapporo's warm welcome |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2010/11/21/travel/sapporos-warm-welcome/ |website=the Japan times |date=21 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== India ====\n*[[Chandigarh]]\n*[[Gandhinagar]]\n*[[Amaravati]]\n*[[Jaipur]]\n*[[Navanagar New bagalkot]]\n*[[Mulund]] [[(Mumbai)]]\n\n==== China ====\n*[[Beijing]]\n*[[Datong]]\n*[[Hong Kong]]\n*[[Xi'an]]\n\n==== Pakistan ====\n*[[Islamabad]]\n\n==== United Arab Emirates ====\n*[[Abu Dhabi]]\n\n==== Israel ====\n*[[Tel Aviv]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[City block]]\n* [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]] (Manhattan street grid)\n* [[Fused grid]]\n* [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] (United States)\n* [[Street hierarchy]]\n* [[Urban planning]]\n* [[Urban structure]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://citiesofthefuture.eu/superblocks-barcelona-answer-to-car-centric-city-f42522bd83ff Superblocks, Barcelona Answer to Car-Centric City]\n* [http://www.hsp.org Historical Society of Pennsylvania]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180820234310/http://www.thegreatamericangrid.com/ The Great American Grid]\n* [https://geoffboeing.com/2018/07/city-street-orientations-world/ City Street Orientations around the World]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grid Plan}}\n[[Category:Road transport]]\n[[Category:Urban studies and planning terminology]]\n[[Category:City layout models]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Space", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_plan"}

The library is visited by more than 6,500 users per day, and circulates almost one million books annually.\n\nGifts from Mamdouha S. Bobst and Kevin Brine made possible a significant renovation of Bobst Library's Mezzanine, First Floor and two Lower Levels which was completed in 2005. The library provided text [[computer terminal]]s for catalog search in the library until the terminals were replaced by PCs with Internet access in 2008.\n\nThe library houses several distinct special collections departments, including the [[Fales Library]], the [[Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Archives]], and the University Archives of NYU. On the north side, on even floors, are large, double-height study rooms featuring floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Washington Square Park.\n\n==Notable events==\n===Suicides===\nIn late 2003, the library was the site of two suicides. In separate incidents, students jumped from the open-air crosswalks inside the library and fell to the [[stereoscopy|stereogram]]-patterned marble floor below.\n\nAfter the second suicide, the university installed [[Plexiglas]] barricades on each level and along the stairways to prevent further jumping. In 2009, a third student jumped to his death from the tenth floor, apparently scaling the plexiglas barricade.<ref>Schapiro, Rich; Parascandola, Rocco; Siemaszko, Corky (November 3, 2009).
