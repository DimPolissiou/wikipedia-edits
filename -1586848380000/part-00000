Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2015 the estimated population was 152,051. It is the capital of the [[Comayagua department]] of [[Honduras]] and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture.  The central square has a cathedral with the oldest clock in the Americas. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|242x242px]]\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by [[Lenca|Lenca people]]. During the colonization Comayagua was founded with the name ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Nueva Valladolid'' by [[Conquistador]] [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]] under orders from [[Francisco de Montejo]], Governor of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] on 8 December 1537. The complementary names \u00abValladolid\u00bb or \u00abPais de las Higueras\u00bb were those given to it by the Spaniards but it kept the primitive of the place that is purely indigenous. Some differ in their etymology but most agree that it is composed of \"Coma\" (which in Lenca dialect means paramo) and \"water\" being its true meaning \"p\u00e1ramo abundant with water\".  From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, on the main square, was begun in 1563 and inaugurated in 1711.<ref>[http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233446/http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 |date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1786, the Spanish Crown created the [[Intendant|''Intendencia'']] of Comayagua, with Comayagua as its capital, which lasted until 1812. From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880. \n\nIn February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n[[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|229x229px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]\n\n==Places of note==\nRight in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish architecture, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, and the republican museum. \n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

The club obtained its first promotion to the National League in 2004\u20132005. Nevertheless, after only their first season in the soccer league; they were relegated to second division once again. For this reason the board of directors, bought the first division franchise from Club Municipal-Valencia of Choluteca.  The Club plays its home games at the municipal stadium 'Carlos Miranda' which currently holds about 10,000 spectators.\n\nComayagua was host to the first International Fellowship of Christian Athletes Motocross camp in September 2012. 60 men and women participated in the camp which was instructed by professional riders from the United States, Jimmy Povolny, Shawn Clark and Ryan Meyung among others.

Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2015 the estimated population was 152,051. It is the capital of the [[Comayagua department]] of [[Honduras]] and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture.  The central square has a cathedral with the oldest clock in the Americas. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|215x215px]]\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by [[Lenca|Lenca people]]. During the colonization Comayagua was founded with the name ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Nueva Valladolid'' by [[Conquistador]] [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]] under orders from [[Francisco de Montejo]], Governor of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] on 8 December 1537. The complementary names \u00abValladolid\u00bb or \u00abPais de las Higueras\u00bb were those given to it by the Spaniards but it kept the primitive of the place that is purely indigenous. Some differ in their etymology but most agree that it is composed of \"Coma\" (which in Lenca dialect means paramo) and \"water\" being its true meaning \"p\u00e1ramo abundant with water\".  From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, on the main square, was begun in 1563 and inaugurated in 1711.<ref>[http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233446/http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 |date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1786, the Spanish Crown created the [[Intendant|''Intendencia'']] of Comayagua, with Comayagua as its capital, which lasted until 1812. From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880. \n\nIn February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n[[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|217x217px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]\n\n==Places of note==\nRight in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish architecture, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, and the republican museum. \n\n==Soto Cano Air Base==\n{{Main|Soto Cano Air Base}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Soto Cano.jpg|thumb|Soto Cano Air Base is home to apx. 550 US military personnel and more than 650 US and Honduran civilians.]] -->\n[[Soto Cano Air Base]] (formerly Palmerola Air Base) is a Honduran military installation located less than {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=off}} from Comayagua.

The club obtained its first promotion to the National League in 2004\u20132005. Nevertheless, after only their first season in the soccer league; they were relegated to second division once again. For this reason the board of directors, bought the first division franchise from Club Municipal-Valencia of Choluteca.  The Club plays its home games at the municipal stadium 'Carlos Miranda' which currently holds about 10,000 spectators.\n\nComayagua was host to the first International Fellowship of Christian Athletes Motocross camp in September 2012. 60 men and women participated in the camp which was instructed by professional riders from the United States, Jimmy Povolny, Shawn Clark and Ryan Meyung among others. The camp was followed by a race sponsored by Colmotos Enduro and was in memory of Dylan First, a US rider who lost his life on the track the previous year.
