Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US\u2013Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are more gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1803 [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] [[Scientific description|described]] two jaguarundi skins and skulls from unknown locations in Central America and proposed the [[scientific name]] ''Felis yagouarundi''.<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History |language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover.

({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) is a wild [[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US\u2013Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are more gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US.

Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, but they simply play with it until the mother ultimately ingests it. Kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also be found in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can live in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for potential predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas.

For her audition, Toprak hired a 70-piece orchestra to perform seven minutes of music that she composed. Toprak described the score as a fusion of electronic and orchestral sounds with the electronic parts representing the aliens and the orchestra representing the main character. Toprak recorded the electronic sounds on an analog-[[synthesizer]] in her home studio and recorded a 90-piece orchestra at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.<ref name=\"ToprakVariety\" /> Toprak said that the main part of the score's development was the title character's theme, while later developing themes for the [[Kree]] and the [[Skrulls]], whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth, while describing the scenes on Earth as \"fun\".<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/>\n\nToprak tried to develop the character's theme as a theme \"that is recognizable from the first two notes\",<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> stating that \"[the audience] don't always have time, especially later in the movie, to fully go into it\".<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\">{{cite news|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2019/03/08/pinar-toprak-captain-marvel/|title=Captain Marvel Composer, Pinar Toprak, Is Living Her Dream!|last=Lin|first=Kelly|publisher=Oh My Disney|date=March 9, 2019}}</ref> She began developing the film's theme by \"humming ideas\", eventually coming with \"a minor-seven interval\" during a walk, which she used as the film's theme.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> Toprak said that [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]]' theme is \"strong and powerful\", but also emotional, in order to focus on the character's vulnerability.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> She also tried to showcase the character's \"super fun and really witty\" nature.<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\"/> Toprak was inspired by 90's films for the score, stating that \"[b]ack then, action movie scores were a lot more note-y. Very dynamic with a lot of things going on\", and that the score pays homage to the score to the action films from 1990.\"<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\"/> Toprak references [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' near the end of the film.\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with [[Michael Giacchino]].<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).

For her audition, Toprak hired a 70-piece orchestra to perform seven minutes of music that she composed. Toprak described the score as a fusion of electronic and orchestral sounds with the electronic parts representing the aliens and the orchestra representing the main character. Toprak recorded the electronic sounds on an analog-[[synthesizer]] in her home studio and recorded a 90-piece orchestra at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.<ref name=\"ToprakVariety\" /> Toprak said that the main part of the score's development was the title character's theme, while later developing themes for the [[Kree]] and the [[Skrulls]], whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth, while describing the scenes on Earth as \"fun\".<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/>\n\nToprak tried to develop the character's theme as a theme \"that is recognizable from the first two notes\",<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> stating that \"[the audience] don't always have time, especially later in the movie, to fully go into it\".<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\">{{cite news|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2019/03/08/pinar-toprak-captain-marvel/|title=Captain Marvel Composer, Pinar Toprak, Is Living Her Dream!|last=Lin|first=Kelly|publisher=Oh My Disney|date=March 9, 2019}}</ref> She began developing the film's theme by \"humming ideas\", eventually coming with \"a minor-seven interval\" during a walk, which she used as the film's theme.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> Toprak said that [[Carol Danvers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Carol Danvers]]' theme is \"strong and powerful\", but also emotional, in order to focus on the character's vulnerability.<ref name=\"ToprakPremiere\"/> She also tried to showcase the character's \"super fun and really witty\" nature.<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\"/> Toprak was inspired by 90's films for the score, stating that \"[b]ack then, action movie scores were a lot more note-y. Very dynamic with a lot of things going on\", and that the score pays homage to the score to the action films from 1990.\"<ref name=\"ToprakOhMyDisney\"/> Toprak references [[Alan Silvestri]]'s theme from ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' near the end of the film.\n\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website ''Screen Geek'' alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with [[Michael Giacchino]].<ref name=\"GiacchinoRumour\" /> Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\".

Bradley, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[What If (comics)|of the same name]]. It explores what would happen if major moments from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of]] the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], their first animated series since becoming their own production company. Bradley serves as [[head writer]] of the series, with [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]] directing.\nmark hamail as   kang the concuer\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] stars as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the ''What If...?'' comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which was designed to reflect the films. Half of the first season's animation is provided by Squeeze, with [[Stephan Franck]] serving as head of animation on the series.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the ''What If...?'' comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L.

Bradley, based on the [[Marvel Comics]] series [[What If (comics)|of the same name]]. It explores what would happen if major moments from [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films of]] the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) occurred differently. The series is produced by [[Marvel Studios]], their first animated series since becoming their own production company. Bradley serves as [[head writer]] of the series, with [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]] directing.\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] stars as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series. By September 2018, Marvel Studios was developing a number of series for Disney+, and one based on the ''What If...?'' comic was first reported in March 2019. The series was officially announced a month later, with many characters in the series set to be voiced by the actors who portray them in the films. Marvel Studios' head of visual development Ryan Meinerding helped define the series' [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, which was designed to reflect the films. Half of the first season's animation is provided by Squeeze, with [[Stephan Franck]] serving as head of animation on the series.\n\n''What If...?''{{'}}s first season is expected to be released in mid-2021, and will consist of 10 episodes. It will be part of [[Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Four|Phase Four]] of the MCU. A second 10-episode season has been announced.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series explores what would happen if major moments from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] occurred differently.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n=== Main ===\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[Uatu|Uatu / The Watcher]]:<br />A member of the [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher race]], who observes the multiverse and occasionally intervenes with events therein.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> Head writer A.C. Bradley said the Watcher is \"above everything else\" and compared the character to a viewer watching the [[Rats in New York City#Notable incidents|\"pizza rat\" video]], stating that he is \"a guy watching a rat drag a slice of pizza across the platform. He has no interest in becoming friends with the rat, living amongst the rat, or doing rat things. He just goes, 'Man, this is remarkable. Look at the little guy go'! That is The Watcher's relationship with humanity\". Bradley said Wright was cast in the role because his voice mixes power, charisma, and authority with a \"warm personality\".<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\"/>\n\n=== Guest ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Hayley Atwell]] as [[Peggy Carter|Captain Peggy Carter]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /><ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n* [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> / [[Star-Lord]]<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath the Pursuer]]<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" />\n* [[Samuel L.

The anthology series, which would be produced by Feige, would explore how the MCU would be altered if certain events had occurred differently, such as if [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] wielded [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]'s hammer [[Mjolnir (comics)|Mjolnir]]. The hope was to have the actors who portray the characters in the MCU voice them in the series as well.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> A month later, Disney and Marvel officially announced the series.<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> In December 2019, Feige revealed that the first season would consist of 10 episodes, and that work had already begun on a second 10-episode season.<ref name=\"SecondSeason\" />\n\n===Writing===\nFeige explained with the announcement of the series that the events that would be depicted as changed would be \"pivotal moments\" from throughout the MCU. He revealed that, for example, the first episode features [[Peggy Carter]] taking the super soldier serum instead of [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]].<ref name=\"MarvelDisneyInvestorDay\" /> A.C. Bradley serves as head writer of the series,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> with Matthew Chauncey serving as story editor.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Episodes were conceived and written by Bradley, Chauncey, series director [[Bryan Andrews (storyboard artist)|Bryan Andrews]], executive producer Brad Winderbaum, junior executive Simona Paparelli, and script coordinator Ryan Little, with the ''What If...?'' comics providing inspiration for potential story points. After creating 30 potential episode concepts, Feige chose his favorites, which were then narrowed down further to get the first season of episodes.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" /> Bradley originally pitched an episode which would have explored a possible reality in which [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] became Thor. However, since the upcoming MCU film ''[[Thor: Love and Thunder]]'' (2021) is set to feature Foster as Thor, the idea was scrapped. After a rumor incorrectly stated that each episode would focus on one film from the Infinity Saga, Bradley clarified that multiple films and characters would be represented in each episode, with the intention of featuring most of the characters from all the films throughout the season.<ref name=\"BradleyInterview\" />\n\n===Casting===\nMarvel's plan for the series was to have actors who portray characters in the MCU films reprise their roles in the series.<ref name=\"WhatIfAnimation\" /> At [[San Diego Comic-Con]] in July 2019, Feige revealed a cast list of these actors that included [[Michael B. Jordan]] as [[Erik Killmonger]], [[Sebastian Stan]] as [[Bucky Barnes]], [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Thanos]], [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]], [[Tom Hiddleston]] as Loki, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]], [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]], [[Hayley Atwell]] as Peggy Carter, [[Chadwick Boseman]] as [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], [[Karen Gillan]] as [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton]], [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]], [[Michael Douglas]] as [[Hank Pym]], [[Neal McDonough]] as [[Dum Dum Dugan]], [[Dominic Cooper]] as [[Howard Stark]], [[Sean Gunn]] as Kraglin, [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]], [[Taika Waititi]] as [[Korg (comics)|Korg]], [[Toby Jones]] as [[Arnim Zola]], [[Djimon Hounsou]] as [[Korath]], [[Jeff Goldblum]] as the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]], and [[Michael Rooker]] as [[Yondu]]. Feige also announced that [[Jeffrey Wright]] had been cast as the [[Uatu|Watcher]], who narrates the series.<ref name=\"SDCCCast\" /> A month later, Atwell revealed that voice recording for the series had already begun.<ref name=\"Atwell\" /> Goldblum indicated in November 2019 that [[Robert Downey Jr.]] would be reprising his role as [[Iron Man (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] in the series.<ref name=\"Downey\" />\n\n===Animation===\nThe series, directed by Andrews,<ref name=\"PolygonD23\" /> will feature a [[Cel shading|cel-shaded]] animation style, with character likenesses based on the actors from the films.<ref name=\"EWD23\" /> Ryan Meinerding, the head of visual development at Marvel Studios, worked with Andrews to find the animation style for the series, which Bradley described as more of a \"cinematic style\".

The term has two distinct uses with the more common usage describing a [[social movement]] that focuses on the \u201cfair\u201d distribution of environmental benefits and burdens.  The other use is an interdisciplinary body of [[social science]] literature that includes theories of the environment and justice, [[environmental laws]] and their implementations, [[environmental policy]] and planning and governance for development and [[sustainability]], and [[political ecology]].<ref name=\"Schlosberg\">Schlosberg, David.

EPA has this goal for all communities and persons across this Nation{{sic}}. It will be achieved when everyone enjoys the same degree of protection from environmental and health hazards and equal access to the decision-making process to have a healthy environment in which to live, learn, and work.<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Justice|publisher=U.S. EPA|url=http://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nOther definitions include: equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits; fair and meaningful participation in environmental decision-making; recognition of community ways of life, [[local knowledge]], and [[cultural difference]]; and the capability of communities and individuals to function and flourish in society.<ref name=\"Schlosberg\"/> An alternative meaning, used in social sciences, of the term \"justice\" is \"the distribution of social goods\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Moral and Political Reasoning in Environmental Practice|last=Schlosberg|first=David|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0262621649|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=79}}</ref> \n\n==Environmental discrimination==\n\n[[Environmental discrimination]] is one issue that environmental justice seeks to address. [[Racism]] and [[discrimination]] against minorities center on a socially-dominant group's belief in its superiority, often resulting in privilege for the dominant group and the mistreatment of non-dominant minorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Racism|url=http://www.pollutionissues.com/Ec-Fi/Environmental-Racism.html|accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref> The combined impact of these privileges and prejudices are just one of the potential reasons that [[waste management]] and high pollution sites tend to be located in minority-dominated areas. A disproportionate quantity of minority communities (for example in [[[[Warren County PCB Landfill|Warren County]], North Carolina|Warren County]], [[North Carolina]]) play host to landfills, incinerators, and other potentially toxic facilities.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Renee|last1=Skelton|first2=Vernice|last2=Miller|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|url=http://www.nrdc.org/ej/history/hej.asp|website=[[National Resource Defense Council]]|date=March 17, 2016|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}</ref> Environmental discrimination can also be the placement of a harmful factory in a place of minority. This can be seen as environmental discrimination because it is placing a harmful entity in a place where the people often don't have the means to fight back against big corporations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}</ref>\n\nEnvironmental discrimination has historically been evident in the process of selecting and building environmentally hazardous sites, including [[waste disposal]], [[manufacturing]], and energy production facilities. The location of transportation infrastructures, including highways, ports, and airports, has also been viewed as a source of environmental injustice. Among the earliest documentation of [[environmental racism]] was a study of the distribution of [[toxic waste]] sites across the United States.<ref>{{cite report|author1=Chavis, Benjamin F.|author2=Goldman, Benjamin A.|author3=Lee, Charles|title=Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States: A National Report on the Racial and Socio-economic Characteristics of Communities with Hazardous Waste Sites|publisher=Commission for Racial Justice, United Church of Christ|date=1987}}</ref> Due to the results of that study, [[waste dump]]s and [[waste incinerator]]s have been the target of environmental justice lawsuits and protests.<ref>Cole, Luke and Sheila R. Foster. (2001) From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement. New York University Press.</ref>\n\n===Litigation===\n\nSome environmental justice lawsuits are based on violations of [[civil rights]] laws.<ref name=\"Section 602 Lawsuits\">{{Cite journal|first=Julia B. Latham|last=Worsham|title=DISPARATE IMPACT LAWSUITS UNDER TITLE VI, SECTION 602: CAN A LEGAL TOOL BUILD ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE? |journal=[[Boston College Law Review]]|publisher=[[Boston College Law School]]|location=Boston, Massachusetts|date=September 15, 2009|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/lwsch/journals/bcealr/27_4/02_TXT.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213084345/http://bc.edu/bc_org/avp/law/lwsch/journals/bcealr/27_4/02_TXT.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTitle VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an environmental justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601. This section is useful because the plaintiff must only prove that the rule or regulation in question had a discriminatory impact. There is no need to prove discriminatory intent. ''Seif v. Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living'' set the precedent that citizens can sue under section 601. There has not yet been a case in which a citizen has sued under section 602, which calls into question whether this right of action exists.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\nThe [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous environmental justice cases.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\n==Initial barriers to minority participation==\n\nWhen [[environmentalism]] first became popular during the early 20th century, the focus was wilderness protection and wildlife preservation. These goals reflected the interests of the movement's initial, primarily white middle and upper class supporters, including through viewing preservation and protection via a lens that failed to appreciate the centuries-long work of indigenous communities who had lived without ushering in the types of environmental devastation these settler colonial \"environmentalists\" now sought to mitigate. The actions of many mainstream environmental organizations still reflect these early principles.<ref name=\"Sandler, R. 2007 pp. 27-55\">Sandler, R., & Phaedra, P. (2007). Environmental justice and environmentalism. (pp. 27-55).</ref>\n\nNumerous low-income minorities felt isolated or negatively impacted by the movement, exemplified by the Southwest Organizing Project's (SWOP) Letter to the Group of 10, a letter sent to major environmental organizations by several local environmental justice activists.<ref>\"SWOP Letter to the Group of 10 .\" Southwest Organizing Project.

Therefore, vulnerable communities with fewer political opportunities are more often exposed to hazardous waste and toxins.<ref name=\"NIMBY Victims\">{{Cite journal\n| last=Gerrard\n| first=Michael B.\n| title=The Victims of NIMBY\n| journal=Fordham Urban Law Journal\n| location=New York, NY\n| date=1993\u20131994\n| url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdurb21&div=25&g_sent=1#505\n}}\n</ref> This has resulted in the [[PIBBY]] principle, or at least the PIMBY (Place-in-minorities'-backyard), as supported by the United Church of Christ's study in 1987.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\">{{Cite journal\n |last              = Roberts\n |first             = R.

Environmental elitism manifested itself in three different forms:\n\n# ''Compositional''&nbsp;\u2013 Environmentalists are from the middle and upper class.\n# ''Ideological''&nbsp;\u2013 The reforms benefit the movement's supporters but impose costs on nonparticipants.\n# ''Impact''&nbsp;\u2013 The reforms have \"regressive social impacts\".

They have convinced minority leaders looking to improve their communities that the economic benefits of industrial facility and the increase in the number of jobs are worth the health risks. In fact, both politicians and businesses have even threatened imminent job loss if communities do not accept hazardous industries and facilities. Although in many cases local residents do not actually receive these benefits, the argument is used to decrease resistance in the communities as well as avoid expenditures used to clean up pollutants and create safer workplace environments.<ref name=\"Job Blackmail\">{{Cite news\n| last=Sussman\n| first=Paul|title='Job blackmail' used to avoid pollution, safety rules|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n| date=November 4, 1982\n| url=https://news.google.com/newspapersid=z1ANAAAAIBAJ&pg=1915,1215294&dq=job+blackmail+and+the+environment&hl=en\n| format=\n}} {{Dead link|date=July 2010}}\n</ref>\n\n===Cost barriers===\n{{Original research|section|date=January 2013}}\nOne of the prominent barriers to minority participation in environmental justice is the initial costs of trying to change the system and prevent companies from dumping their toxic waste and other pollutants in areas with high numbers of minorities living in them. There are massive legal fees involved in fighting for environmental justice and trying to shed environmental racism. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a rule that the claimant may have to cover the fees of their opponents, which further exacerbates any cost issues, especially with lower-income minority groups; also, the only way for environmental justice groups to hold companies accountable for their pollution and breaking any licensing issues over [[waste disposal]] would be to sue the government for not enforcing rules. This would lead to the forbidding legal fees that most could not afford.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries|first=Elisabeth|title=What price environmental justice?|url=http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2011-03-09/what-price-environmental-justice|accessdate=24 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807163956/http://www.environmentalistonline.com/article/2011-03-09/what-price-environmental-justice|archive-date=7 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> This can be seen by the fact that out of 210 judicial review cases between 2005 and 2009, 56% did not proceed due to costs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cost Barriers to Environmental Justice|url=http://us.practicallaw.com/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1247269202785&ssbinary=true|accessdate=24 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Overcoming Barriers==\nViewing their communities as disproportionately impacted by [[environmental degradation]] and disproportionately denied access to movements claiming to redress this, many organizations by and for racialized communities and low-wealth groups began to form in the 1970s and 80s to address environmental injustices. Their work has come to collectively form the backbone of the contemporary environmental justice movement, whose guiding principles were especially documented during the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1991.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bullard|first=Robert|date=2003|title=Environmental justice for all|url=http://www.uky.edu/~tmute2/GEI-Web/password-protect/GEI-readings/Bullard-Environmental%20justice%20for%20all.pdf|journal=Crisis|volume=110|pages=24|via=}}</ref> Participants in this Summit established 17 particular Principles of Environmental Justice.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ejnet.org/ej/principles.pdf|title=Principles of Environmental Justice|last=We, the People of Color|date=1991|website=EJ Net|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Contributions of the Civil Rights Movement==\n\nDuring the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1960s, activists participated in a social movement that created a unified atmosphere and advocated goals of social justice and equality. The community organization and the social values of the era have translated to the Environmental Justice movement.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\n===Similar goals and tactics===\n\nThe Environmental Justice movement and the Civil Rights Movement have many commonalities. At their core, the movements' goals are the same: \"social justice, equal protection, and an end to institutional discrimination.\"  By stressing the similarities of the two movements, it emphasizes that environmental equity is a right for all citizens. Because the two movements have parallel goals, it is useful to employ similar tactics that often emerge on the grassroots level. Common confrontational strategies include protests, neighborhood demonstrations, picketing, political pressure, and demonstration.<ref name=\"African American Community\">{{Cite journal\n| last=Bullard\n| first=Robert D.\n| title=The Quest for Environmental Equity: Mobilizing the African-American Community for Social Change\n| journal=American Environmentalism: The U.S. Environmental Movement, 1970-1990\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis New York Inc.\n| location=New York\n| year=1992\n}}</ref>\n\n===Existing organizations and leaders===\n\nJust as the civil rights movement of the 1960s began in the South, the fight for environmental equity has been largely based in the South, where environmental discrimination is most prominent. In these southern communities, black churches and other voluntary associations are used to organize resistance efforts, including research and demonstrations, such as the protest in Warren County, North Carolina. As a result of the existing community structure, many church leaders and civil rights activists, such as Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad]], have spearheaded the Environmental Justice movement.<ref name=\"African American Community\"/>\n\n[[The Bronx]], in New York City, has become a recent example of Environmental Justice succeeding. [[Majora Carter]] spearheaded the [[South Bronx Greenway]] Project, bringing local economic development, local [[urban heat island]] mitigation, positive social influences, [[Open Space Accessibility in California|access to public open space]], and aesthetically stimulating environments. The [[New York City Department of Design and Construction]] has recently recognized the value of the South Bronx Greenway design, and consequently utilized it as a widely distributed smart growth template. This venture is the ideal [[shovel-ready]] project with over $50 million in funding.<ref name=\"southbronx\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.majoracartergroup.com/services/case-histories/south-bronx-greenway/ \n |title=South Bronx Greenway \n |publisher=Majora Carter Group \n |accessdate=2010-08-07 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129061016/http://www.majoracartergroup.com/services/case-histories/south-bronx-greenway/ \n |archivedate=2010-11-29 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Litigation===\n\nSeveral of the most successful Environmental Justice lawsuits are based on violations of civil rights laws. The first case to use civil rights as a means to legally challenge the siting of a waste facility was in 1979. With the legal representation of Linda McKeever Bullard, the wife of Robert D. Bullard, residents of Houston's Northwood Manor opposed the decision of the city and Browning Ferris Industries to construct a solid waste facility near their mostly African-American neighborhood.<ref name=\"Section 602 Lawsuits\" />\n\nIn 1979, Northeast Community Action Group, or NECAG, was formed by African American homeowners in a suburban, middle income neighborhood in order to keep a landfill out of their home town. This group was the first organization that found the connection between race and pollution. The group, alongside their attorney Linda McKeever Bullard started the lawsuit Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., which was the first of its kind to challenge the sitting of a waste facility under civil rights law.<ref>Robert D. Bullard, \"Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community,\" Sociological Inquiry 53 (Spring 1983): 273-288.</ref><ref>Bullard, Robert. \"Dismantling Toxic Racism.\" Crisis 1 July 2007: 21-23.</ref>\nThe [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous Environmental Justice cases.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\nTitle VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. The two most paramount sections in these cases are sections 601 and 602. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an Environmental Justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601; in ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs must also show intent to discriminate to successfully challenge the government under 602.\n\n==Contributions of the Reproductive Justice Movement==\nMany participants in the [[Reproductive Justice]] Movement see their struggle as linked with those for environmental justice, and vice versa. [[Loretta Ross]] describes the reproductive justice framework as addressing \"the ability of any woman to determine her own reproductive destiny\" and argues this is inextricably \"linked directly to the conditions in her community \u2013 and these conditions are not just a matter of individual choice and access.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Reproductive Justice Briefing Book; A Primer on Reproductive Justice and Social Change |last=Ross |first=Loretta |publisher=Berkeley Law |location=Berkeley, California|date=2007 |url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/courses/fileDL.php?fID=4051 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Such conditions include those central to environmental justice\u2014including the siting of toxic contamination and pollution of food, air, and waterways. Mohawk midwife [[Katsi Cook]] helps illustrate one link between [[reproductive rights|reproductive]] and environmental justice when she explains, \"at the breasts of women flows the relationship of those generations both to society and to the natural world. In this way the earth is our mother, grandma says. In this way, we as women are the earth.\"<ref>{{Cite book|first=Jael|last=Sillman|title=Undivided Rights, Women of Color Organize for Reproductive Justice |publisher=[[Haymarket Books]]|year=2016|isbn=9781608466177|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=126}}</ref> Cook founded the Mother's Milk Project in the 1980s to address the toxic contamination of maternal bodies through exposure to fish and water contaminated by a [[General Motors]] [[Superfund]] site. In underscoring how contamination disproportionately impacted [[Akwesasne]] women and their children through gestation and breastfeeding, this Project brought to the fore one of the many intersections between reproductive and environmental justice.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The River is In Us: Fighting Toxics in a Mohawk Community|last=Hoover|first=Elizabeth|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|year=2017|isbn=9781517903039|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Affected groups==\n\nAmong the affected groups of Environmental Justice, those in high-poverty and racial minority groups have the most propensity to receive the harm of environmental injustice. Poor people account for more than 20% of the [[Air_pollution#Health_effects|human health impacts]] from industrial toxic air releases, compared to 12.9% of the population nationwide.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Environmental-Hazard Exposure in Metropolitan Los Angeles Manuel Pastor, Jr.</ref> This does not account for the inequity found among individual minority groups. Some studies that test statistically for effects of race and ethnicity, while controlling for income and other factors, suggest racial gaps in exposure that persist across all bands of income.<ref>Justice in the Air: Tracking Toxic Pollution from America's Industries and Companies to Our States, Cities, and Neighborhoods Michael Ash, {{cite web|url=http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725114107/http://www.peri.umass.edu/justice/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}.</ref>\n\nAfrican-Americans are affected by a variety of Environmental Justice issues. One notorious example is the \"[[Cancer Alley]]\" region of Louisiana. This 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is home to 125 companies that produce one quarter of the petrochemical products manufactured in the United States. The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] has concluded that the African-American community has been disproportionately affected by Cancer Alley as a result of Louisiana's current state and local permit system for hazardous facilities, as well as their low socio-economic status and limited political influence.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\">Shrader-Frechette. 2002. ''Environmental Justice Creating Equality, Reclaiming Democracy''. Oxford University Press: New York, NY</ref> Another incidence of long-term environmental injustice occurred in the \"West Grove\" community of Miami, Florida. From 1925 to 1970, the predominately poor, African American residents of the \"West Grove\" endured the negative effects of exposure to carcinogenic emissions and toxic waste discharge from a large trash incinerator called Old Smokey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alfieri|first=Anthony Victor|date=2013-11-14|title=Paternalistic Interventions in Civil Rights and Poverty Law: A Case Study of Environmental Justice|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2354382}}</ref> Despite official acknowledgement as a public nuisance, the incinerator project was expanded in 1961. It was not until the surrounding, predominantly white neighborhoods began to experience the negative impacts from Old Smokey that the legal battle began to close the incinerator.\n\nIndigenous groups are often the victims of environmental injustices. [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|Native Americans have suffered abuses related to uranium mining]] in the American West. Churchrock, New Mexico, in Navajo territory was home to the longest continuous uranium mining in any Navajo land. From 1954 until 1968, the tribe leased land to mining companies who did not obtain consent from Navajo families or report any consequences of their activities. Not only did the miners significantly deplete the limited water supply, but they also contaminated what was left of the Navajo water supply with uranium. Kerr-McGee and United Nuclear Corporation, the two largest mining companies, argued that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not apply to them, and maintained that Native American land is not subject to environmental protections. The courts did not force them to comply with US clean water regulations until 1980.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\"/>\n\nThe most common example of environmental injustice among Latinos is the exposure to pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides such as [[parathion]]. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, and as a result of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\"/> Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, [[Endosulfan]] is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. [[Endosulfan]], like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.<ref name=\"ejfoundation.org\">[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nResidents of cities along the US-Mexico border are also affected. [[Maquiladora]]s are assembly plants operated by American, Japanese, and other foreign countries, located along the US-Mexico border. The maquiladoras use cheap Mexican labor to assemble imported components and raw material, and then transport finished products back to the United States. Much of the waste ends up being illegally dumped in sewers, ditches, or in the desert. Along the Lower [[Rio Grande Valley]], maquiladoras dump their toxic wastes into the river from which 95 percent of residents obtain their drinking water. In the border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Mexico]], the rate of [[anencephaly]] (babies born without brains) is four times the national average.<ref name=bullard>Bullard, Robert D. \"Environmental Justice: Grassroots Activism and Its Impact on Public Policy Decision Making.\" N. pag.

Earthlife Africa was formed in 1988 (www.earthlife.org.za), making it Africa's first environmental justice organisation. In 1992, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), a nationwide umbrella organization designed to coordinate the activities of environmental activists and organizations interested in social and environmental justice, was created. By 1995, the network expanded to include 150 member organizations and by 2000, it included over 600 member organizations.<ref name=southafrica/>\n\nWith the election of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1994, the environmental justice movement gained an ally in government. The ANC noted \"poverty and environmental degradation have been closely linked\" in South Africa.{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} The ANC made it clear that environmental inequalities and injustices would be addressed as part of the party's post-apartheid reconstruction and development mandate. The new South African Constitution, finalized in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights that grants South Africans the right to an \"environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being\" and \"to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that\n#prevent pollution and ecological degradation;\n#promote conservation; and\n#secure [[ecologically sustainable development]] and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development\".<ref name=southafrica>McDonald, David A.

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for [[land rehabilitation]] during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.<ref name=southafrica/>\n\nIn October 1998, the Department of Minerals and Energy released a White Paper entitled ''A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa'', which included a section on Environmental Management. The White Paper states \"Government, in recognition of the responsibility of the State as custodian of the nation's natural resources, will ensure that the essential development of the country's mineral resources will take place within a framework of sustainable development and in accordance with national environmental policy, norms, and standards\". It adds that any environmental policy \"must ensure a cost-effective and competitive mining industry.\"<ref name=southafrica/>\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, the \"Environmental Justice Movement\" is not defined as it is in the United States. Australia does have some discrimination mainly in the siting of hazardous waste facilities in areas where the people are not given proper information about the company. The injustice that takes place in Australia is defined as environmental politics on who get the unwanted waste site or who has control over where factory opens up. The movement towards equal environmental politics focuses more on who can fight for companies to build, and takes place in the parliament; whereas, in the United States Environmental Justice is trying to make nature safer for all people.<ref name=\"Arcioni, 2005\">Arcioni, Elisa and Mitchell, Glenn(2005).''Environmental Justice in Australia: When RATS became IRATE''.

As a result of rapid [[industrialization]], people started to have awareness on pollution, and from the environmental discourses the idea of environmental justice appeared. The concept of environmental justice appeared in South Korea in late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2941%26context%3Detd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&context=etd |archivedate=2015-04-24 }}''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle & Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy.

The policies and social environment had no room for environmental discussions, which aggravated the pollution in the country.<ref>[http://www.aks.ac.kr/home/index.do]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Economy'', Accessed 2015-08-07.</ref>\n\nEnvironmental movements in South Korea started from [[air pollution]] campaigns. As the notion of environment pollution spread, the focus on environmental activism shifted from existing pollution to preventing future pollution, and the organizations eventually started to criticize the government policies that are neglecting the environmental issues.<ref>[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=572765&cid=46634&categoryId=46634]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Environmental Movement'', Accessed 2015-08-07.</ref>\nThe concept of environmental justice was introduced in South Korea among the discussions of environment after 1990s. While the environmental organizations analyzed the condition of pollution in South Korea, they noticed that the environmental problems were inequitably focused especially on regions where people with low social and economic status were concentrated.\n\nThe problems of environmental injustice have arisen by environment related organizations, but approaches to solve the problems were greatly supported by the government, which developed various policies and launched institution. These actions helped raise awareness of environmental justice in South Korea. Existing environment policies were modified to cover environmental justice issues.\n\nEnvironmental justice began to be widely recognized in the 1990s through policy making and researches of related institutions. For example, the [[Ministry of Environment]], which was founded in 1992, launched Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) to raise awareness of the problem and figure out appropriate plans.<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/bgreen-activism-and-civil-society-south-korea-b]''Green Activism and Civil Society in South Korea (2002)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> As a part of its activities, Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) held Environmental Justice forum in 1999, to gather and analyze the existing studies on the issue which were done sporadically by various organizations. Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) started as a small organization, but it is keep growing and expanding. In 2002, CMEJ had more than 5 times the numbers of members and 3 times the budget it had in the beginning year.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&context=etd]''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle & Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy.

One example is the construction of [[Saemangeum Seawall]]. The construction of Saemangeum Seawall, which is the world's longest dyke (33 kilometers) runs between [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Saemangeum]] estuary, was part of a government project initiated in 1991.<ref>[https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/historical-views/content/-/article/saemangeum-dam-south-korea]''Earth Watching : Saemangeum Dam'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> The project raised concerns on the destruction of ecosystem and taking away the local residential regions. It caught the attention of environmental justice activists because the main victims were low-income fishing population and their future generations. This is considered as an example of environmental injustice which was caused by the execution of exclusive development-centered policy.\n\nThe construction of [[Seoul-Incheon canal]] also raised environmental justice controversies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111063056/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 }}''The Korea Times : Seoul-Incheon Canal Construction Kicks Off (2009)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> The construction took away the residential regions and farming areas of the local residents. Also, the environment worsened in the area because of the appearance of wet fogs which was caused by water deprivation and local climate changes caused by the construction of canal. The local residents, mostly people with weak economic basis, were severely affected by the construction and became the main victims of such environmental damages. While the socially and economically weak citizens suffered from the environmental changes, most of the benefits went to the industries and conglomerates with political power.\n\nConstruction of [[Factory|industrial complex]] was also criticized in the context of environmental justice. The conflict in Wicheon region is one example. The region became the center of controversy when the government decided to build industrial complex of dye houses, which were formerly located in [[Daegu]] metropolitan region. As a result of the construction, [[Nakdong River]], which is one of the main rivers in South Korea, was contaminated and local residents suffered from environmental changes caused by the construction.<ref>[http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kenss/KHGGB3/1996/v5n3/KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143818/http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Focean.kisti.re.kr%2Fdownfile%2Fvolume%2Fkenss%2FKHGGB3%2F1996%2Fv5n3%2FKHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297 |date=2017-03-20 }}''Koreascience : A Policy Study to Preserve the Water Quality through the Activation of Local Autonomy'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref><ref>[http://kfem.or.kr/wp-content/uploads/1997/08/data_envinfo_einter_179_casestudy-on-Environmental-Issue-in-Korea.doc&prev=search]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Choony, Kim.

This act increases the amount of waste in the third world countries, most of which do not have proper sanitation for their own waste much less the waste of another country. Often, the people of the less-developed countries are exposed to toxins from this waste and do not even realize what kind of waste they are encountering or the health problems that could come with it.<ref name=\"Pellow, 2007\">[[David Naguib Pellow|Pellow, David Naguib]]. 2007. ''Resisting Global Toxics''. The MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts.</ref>\n\nOne prominent example of northern countries shipping their waste to southern countries took place in [[Haiti]]. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had ash from the incineration of toxic waste that they did not have room to dump. Philadelphia decided to put the ash into the hands of a private company, which shipped the ash and dumped it in various other parts of the world, outside of the United States. ''[[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|The Khian Sea]]'', the ship the ash was put on, sailed around the world and many countries would not accept the waste because it was hazardous for the environment and the people. The ship owners finally dumped the waste, labeled Fertilizer, in Haiti, on the beach, and sailed away in the night. The government of Haiti was infuriated and called for the waste to be removed, but the company would not come to take the ash away. The fighting over who was responsible for the waste and who would remove the waste went on for many years. After debating for over ten years, the waste was removed and taken back to a site just outside Philadelphia to be disposed of permanently.<ref name=\"Pellow, 2007\"/>\n\nThe reason that this transporting of waste from Northern countries to the Southern countries takes place is because it is cheaper to transport waste to another country and dump it there, than to pay to dump the waste in the producing country because the third world countries do not have the same strict industry regulations as the more developed countries. The countries that the waste is taken to are usually impoverished and the governments have little or no control over the happenings in the country or do not care about the people.<ref name=\"Park, 1998\">{{Cite journal\n|last=Park\n|first= Rozelia S.\n|title= An Examination of International Environmental Racism through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste\n|journal= Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies\n|location=Indiana, IL\n|date=1997\u20131998\n}}</ref>\n\n===Transnational movement networks===\n\nMany of the Environmental Justice Networks that began in the United States expanded their horizons to include many other countries and became Transnational Networks for Environmental Justice.

Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an environmental justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601. This section is useful because the plaintiff must only prove that the rule or regulation in question had a discriminatory impact. There is no need to prove discriminatory intent. ''Seif v. Chester Residents Concerned for Quality Living'' set the precedent that citizens can sue under section 601. There has not yet been a case in which a citizen has sued under section 602, which calls into question whether this right of action exists.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\nThe [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous environmental justice cases.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\n==Initial barriers to minority participation==\n\nWhen [[environmentalism]] first became popular during the early 20th century, the focus was wilderness protection and wildlife preservation. These goals reflected the interests of the movement's initial, primarily white middle and upper class supporters, including through viewing preservation and protection via a lens that failed to appreciate the centuries-long work of indigenous communities who had lived without ushering in the types of environmental devastation these settler colonial \"environmentalists\" now sought to mitigate.

There are massive legal fees involved in fighting for environmental justice and trying to shed environmental racism. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a rule that the claimant may have to cover the fees of their opponents, which further exacerbates any cost issues, especially with lower-income minority groups; also, the only way for environmental justice groups to hold companies accountable for their pollution and breaking any licensing issues over [[waste disposal]] would be to sue the government for not enforcing rules.

The community organization and the social values of the era have translated to the Environmental Justice movement.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\n===Similar goals and tactics===\n\nThe Environmental Justice movement and the Civil Rights Movement have many commonalities. At their core, the movements' goals are the same: \"social justice, equal protection, and an end to institutional discrimination.\"  By stressing the similarities of the two movements, it emphasizes that environmental equity is a right for all citizens. Because the two movements have parallel goals, it is useful to employ similar tactics that often emerge on the grassroots level. Common confrontational strategies include protests, neighborhood demonstrations, picketing, political pressure, and demonstration.<ref name=\"African American Community\">{{Cite journal\n| last=Bullard\n| first=Robert D.\n| title=The Quest for Environmental Equity: Mobilizing the African-American Community for Social Change\n| journal=American Environmentalism: The U.S. Environmental Movement, 1970-1990\n| publisher=Taylor & Francis New York Inc.\n| location=New York\n| year=1992\n}}</ref>\n\n===Existing organizations and leaders===\n\nJust as the civil rights movement of the 1960s began in the South, the fight for environmental equity has been largely based in the South, where environmental discrimination is most prominent. In these southern communities, black churches and other voluntary associations are used to organize resistance efforts, including research and demonstrations, such as the protest in Warren County, North Carolina. As a result of the existing community structure, many church leaders and civil rights activists, such as Reverend [[Benjamin Chavis Muhammad]], have spearheaded the Environmental Justice movement.<ref name=\"African American Community\"/>\n\n[[The Bronx]], in New York City, has become a recent example of Environmental Justice succeeding. [[Majora Carter]] spearheaded the [[South Bronx Greenway]] Project, bringing local economic development, local [[urban heat island]] mitigation, positive social influences, [[Open Space Accessibility in California|access to public open space]], and aesthetically stimulating environments. The [[New York City Department of Design and Construction]] has recently recognized the value of the South Bronx Greenway design, and consequently utilized it as a widely distributed smart growth template.

The first case to use civil rights as a means to legally challenge the siting of a waste facility was in 1979. With the legal representation of Linda McKeever Bullard, the wife of Robert D. Bullard, residents of Houston's Northwood Manor opposed the decision of the city and Browning Ferris Industries to construct a solid waste facility near their mostly African-American neighborhood.<ref name=\"Section 602 Lawsuits\" />\n\nIn 1979, Northeast Community Action Group, or NECAG, was formed by African American homeowners in a suburban, middle income neighborhood in order to keep a landfill out of their home town. This group was the first organization that found the connection between race and pollution. The group, alongside their attorney Linda McKeever Bullard started the lawsuit Bean v. Southwestern Waste Management, Inc., which was the first of its kind to challenge the sitting of a waste facility under civil rights law.<ref>Robert D. Bullard, \"Solid Waste Sites and the Black Houston Community,\" Sociological Inquiry 53 (Spring 1983): 273-288.</ref><ref>Bullard, Robert. \"Dismantling Toxic Racism.\" Crisis 1 July 2007: 21-23.</ref>\nThe [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which was used many times to defend minority rights during the 1960s, has also been used in numerous Environmental Justice cases.<ref name=\"Civil Rights Learning\"/>\n\nTitle VI of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is often used in lawsuits that claim environmental inequality. The two most paramount sections in these cases are sections 601 and 602. Section 601 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin by any government agency receiving federal assistance. To win an Environmental Justice case that claims an agency violated this statute, the plaintiff must prove the agency intended to discriminate. Section 602 requires agencies to create rules and regulations that uphold section 601; in ''[[Alexander v. Sandoval]]'', the Supreme Court held that plaintiffs must also show intent to discriminate to successfully challenge the government under 602.\n\n==Contributions of the Reproductive Justice Movement==\nMany participants in the [[Reproductive Justice]] Movement see their struggle as linked with those for environmental justice, and vice versa. [[Loretta Ross]] describes the reproductive justice framework as addressing \"the ability of any woman to determine her own reproductive destiny\" and argues this is inextricably \"linked directly to the conditions in her community \u2013 and these conditions are not just a matter of individual choice and access.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Reproductive Justice Briefing Book; A Primer on Reproductive Justice and Social Change |last=Ross |first=Loretta |publisher=Berkeley Law |location=Berkeley, California|date=2007 |url=https://www.law.berkeley.edu/php-programs/courses/fileDL.php?fID=4051 |pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Such conditions include those central to environmental justice\u2014including the siting of toxic contamination and pollution of food, air, and waterways. Mohawk midwife [[Katsi Cook]] helps illustrate one link between [[reproductive rights|reproductive]] and environmental justice when she explains, \"at the breasts of women flows the relationship of those generations both to society and to the natural world.

One notorious example is the \"[[Cancer Alley]]\" region of Louisiana. This 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans is home to 125 companies that produce one quarter of the petrochemical products manufactured in the United States. The [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] has concluded that the African-American community has been disproportionately affected by Cancer Alley as a result of Louisiana's current state and local permit system for hazardous facilities, as well as their low socio-economic status and limited political influence.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\">Shrader-Frechette. 2002. ''Environmental Justice Creating Equality, Reclaiming Democracy''. Oxford University Press: New York, NY</ref> Another incidence of long-term environmental injustice occurred in the \"West Grove\" community of Miami, Florida. From 1925 to 1970, the predominately poor, African American residents of the \"West Grove\" endured the negative effects of exposure to carcinogenic emissions and toxic waste discharge from a large trash incinerator called Old Smokey.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alfieri|first=Anthony Victor|date=2013-11-14|title=Paternalistic Interventions in Civil Rights and Poverty Law: A Case Study of Environmental Justice|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=2354382}}</ref> Despite official acknowledgement as a public nuisance, the incinerator project was expanded in 1961. It was not until the surrounding, predominantly white neighborhoods began to experience the negative impacts from Old Smokey that the legal battle began to close the incinerator.\n\nIndigenous groups are often the victims of environmental injustices. [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people|Native Americans have suffered abuses related to uranium mining]] in the American West. Churchrock, New Mexico, in Navajo territory was home to the longest continuous uranium mining in any Navajo land. From 1954 until 1968, the tribe leased land to mining companies who did not obtain consent from Navajo families or report any consequences of their activities. Not only did the miners significantly deplete the limited water supply, but they also contaminated what was left of the Navajo water supply with uranium. Kerr-McGee and United Nuclear Corporation, the two largest mining companies, argued that the Federal Water Pollution Control Act did not apply to them, and maintained that Native American land is not subject to environmental protections. The courts did not force them to comply with US clean water regulations until 1980.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\"/>\n\nThe most common example of environmental injustice among Latinos is the exposure to pesticides faced by farmworkers. After DDT and other chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides were banned in the United States in 1972, farmers began using more acutely toxic organophosphate pesticides such as [[parathion]]. A large portion of farmworkers in the US are working as undocumented immigrants, and as a result of their political disadvantage, are not able to protest against regular exposure to pesticides or benefit from the protections of Federal laws.<ref name=\"Shrader-Frechette 2002\"/> Exposure to chemical pesticides in the cotton industry also affects farmers in India and Uzbekistan. Banned throughout much of the rest of the world because of the potential threat to human health and the natural environment, [[Endosulfan]] is a highly toxic chemical, the safe use of which cannot be guaranteed in the many developing countries it is used in. [[Endosulfan]], like DDT, is an organochlorine and persists in the environment long after it has killed the target pests, leaving a deadly legacy for people and wildlife.<ref name=\"ejfoundation.org\">[http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219205051/http://www.ejfoundation.org/page246.html |date=February 19, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nResidents of cities along the US-Mexico border are also affected. [[Maquiladora]]s are assembly plants operated by American, Japanese, and other foreign countries, located along the US-Mexico border. The maquiladoras use cheap Mexican labor to assemble imported components and raw material, and then transport finished products back to the United States. Much of the waste ends up being illegally dumped in sewers, ditches, or in the desert. Along the Lower [[Rio Grande Valley]], maquiladoras dump their toxic wastes into the river from which 95 percent of residents obtain their drinking water. In the border cities of [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros, Mexico]], the rate of [[anencephaly]] (babies born without brains) is four times the national average.<ref name=bullard>Bullard, Robert D. \"Environmental Justice: Grassroots Activism and Its Impact on Public Policy Decision Making.\" N. pag.

This is due to the way that women typically interact more closely with their environments at home, such as through handling food preparation and childcare. Women also tend to be the leaders in environmental justice activist movements. Despite this, it tends not to be considered a mainstream feminist issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bell|first=Karen|year=2016|title=Bread and Roses: A Gender Perspective on Environmental Justice and Public Health|url=|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=13|issue=10|page=1005|doi=10.3390/ijerph13101005|pmc=5086744|pmid=27754351}}</ref>\n\n==Government agencies==\n\n===U.S. Department of Agriculture===\n\nIn its 2012 environmental justice strategy documents, the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) stated an ongoing desire to integrate environmental justice into its core mission, internal operations and programming. It identified ambitious timeframes for action and promised improved efforts to highlight, track and coordinate EJ activities among its many sub-agencies. Agency-wide the USDA expanded its perspective on EJ, so that in addition to preventing disproportionate environmental impacts on EJ communities, USDA voiced a commitment to improve public participation processes and use its technical and financial assistance programs to improve the quality of life in all communities. In 2011, Secretary of Agriculture [[Tom Vilsack]] emphasized the USDA's focus on EJ in rural communities around the United States, as well as connecting with Indigenous Tribes and ensuring they understand and receive their environmental rights.. USDA funds or implements many creative programs with social and environmental equity goals, however it has no staff dedicated solely to EJ, and faces the challenges of limited budgets and coordinating the efforts of a highly diverse agency.\n\n====Background====\n\nThe USDA is the executive agency responsible for federal policy on food, agriculture, [[natural resources]], and [[quality of life]] in rural America.<ref name=\"ftn1\">USDA, Mission Statement, {{cite web |url=http://usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701232252/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=MISSION_STATEMENT |archivedate=2012-07-01 }}.</ref> The USDA has more than 100,000 employees and delivers over $96.5 billion in public services to programs worldwide.<ref name=\"ftn2\">USDA, Performance and Accountability Report at ii, http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100505073828/http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/mimedetector?url=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf&text=http://www.ocfo.usda.gov/usdarpt/pdf/par2008.pdf |date=2010-05-05 }}</ref> To fulfill its general mandate, USDA's departments are organized into seven mission areas:1) Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services; 2) Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services; 3) Food Safety; 4) Marketing and Regulatory Programs; 5) Natural Resources and Environment; 6) Research, Education and Economics and; 7) Rural Development.<ref name=\"ftn3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usda.gov/our-agency/about-usda/mission-areas|title=Mission Areas|website=www.usda.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-09-23}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12898, \"Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations.\"\u009d Executive Order 12898 requires that achieving EJ must be part of each federal agency's mission. Agency programs, policies and activities can lead to health and environmental effects that disproportionately impact minority and low-income populations.

The environmental discrimination that they experience ranges from the unequal distribution of environmental harms as well as the unequal distribution of education, health services and employment. In many countries Romani peoples are forced to live in the slums because many of the laws to get residence permits are discriminatory against them. This forces Romani people to live in urban \"ghetto\" type housing or in shantytowns. In the Czech Republic and Romania, the Romani peoples are forced to live in places that have less access to running water and sewage, and in Ostrava, Czech Republic, the Romani people live in apartments located above an abandoned mine, which emits methane. Also in Bulgaria, the public infrastructure extends throughout the town of Sofia until it reaches the Romani village where there is very little water access or sewage capacity.<ref name=\"Steger, 2008\">Steger, Tamara and Richard Filcak. 2009.

They have been or will be organized in over sixty different French and European cities, such as [[Bilbao]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]], [[Lyon]] or [[Paris]].\n\n===South Africa===\n\nUnder colonial and [[apartheid]] governments in South Africa, thousands of black South Africans were removed from their ancestral lands to make way for game parks. Earthlife Africa was formed in 1988 (www.earthlife.org.za), making it Africa's first environmental justice organisation. In 1992, the Environmental Justice Networking Forum (EJNF), a nationwide umbrella organization designed to coordinate the activities of environmental activists and organizations interested in social and environmental justice, was created. By 1995, the network expanded to include 150 member organizations and by 2000, it included over 600 member organizations.<ref name=southafrica/>\n\nWith the election of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) in 1994, the environmental justice movement gained an ally in government. The ANC noted \"poverty and environmental degradation have been closely linked\" in South Africa.{{Attribution needed|date=March 2012}} The ANC made it clear that environmental inequalities and injustices would be addressed as part of the party's post-apartheid reconstruction and development mandate. The new South African Constitution, finalized in 1996, includes a Bill of Rights that grants South Africans the right to an \"environment that is not harmful to their health or well-being\" and \"to have the environment protected, for the benefit of present and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures that\n#prevent pollution and ecological degradation;\n#promote conservation; and\n#secure [[ecologically sustainable development]] and use of natural resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development\".<ref name=southafrica>McDonald, David A.

The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] introduced a new Minerals Act that began to address environmental considerations by recognizing the health and safety concerns of workers and the need for [[land rehabilitation]] during and after mining operations. In 1993, the Act was amended to require each new mine to have an Environmental Management Program Report (EMPR) prepared before breaking ground. These EMPRs were intended to force mining companies to outline all the possible environmental impacts of the particular mining operation and to make provision for environmental management.<ref name=southafrica/>\n\nIn October 1998, the Department of Minerals and Energy released a White Paper entitled ''A Minerals and Mining Policy for South Africa'', which included a section on Environmental Management. The White Paper states \"Government, in recognition of the responsibility of the State as custodian of the nation's natural resources, will ensure that the essential development of the country's mineral resources will take place within a framework of sustainable development and in accordance with national environmental policy, norms, and standards\". It adds that any environmental policy \"must ensure a cost-effective and competitive mining industry.\"<ref name=southafrica/>\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, the \"Environmental Justice Movement\" is not defined as it is in the United States. Australia does have some discrimination mainly in the siting of hazardous waste facilities in areas where the people are not given proper information about the company. The injustice that takes place in Australia is defined as environmental politics on who get the unwanted waste site or who has control over where factory opens up. The movement towards equal environmental politics focuses more on who can fight for companies to build, and takes place in the parliament; whereas, in the United States Environmental Justice is trying to make nature safer for all people.<ref name=\"Arcioni, 2005\">Arcioni, Elisa and Mitchell, Glenn(2005).''Environmental Justice in Australia: When RATS became IRATE''.

As a result of rapid [[industrialization]], people started to have awareness on pollution, and from the environmental discourses the idea of environmental justice appeared. The concept of environmental justice appeared in South Korea in late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2941%26context%3Detd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&context=etd |archivedate=2015-04-24 }}''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle & Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy. The Florida State University DigiNole Commons'', Accessed 2015-08-07.</ref>\n\nSouth Korea experienced rapid economic growth (which is commonly referred to as the '[[Miracle on the Han River]]') in the 20th century as a result of industrialization policies adapted by [[Park Chung-hee]] after 1970s. The policies and social environment had no room for environmental discussions, which aggravated the pollution in the country.<ref>[http://www.aks.ac.kr/home/index.do]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Economy'', Accessed 2015-08-07.</ref>\n\nEnvironmental movements in South Korea started from [[air pollution]] campaigns. As the notion of environment pollution spread, the focus on environmental activism shifted from existing pollution to preventing future pollution, and the organizations eventually started to criticize the government policies that are neglecting the environmental issues.<ref>[http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=572765&cid=46634&categoryId=46634]''The Academy of Korean Studies : Environmental Movement'', Accessed 2015-08-07.</ref>\nThe concept of environmental justice was introduced in South Korea among the discussions of environment after 1990s. While the environmental organizations analyzed the condition of pollution in South Korea, they noticed that the environmental problems were inequitably focused especially on regions where people with low social and economic status were concentrated.\n\nThe problems of environmental injustice have arisen by environment related organizations, but approaches to solve the problems were greatly supported by the government, which developed various policies and launched institution. These actions helped raise awareness of environmental justice in South Korea. Existing environment policies were modified to cover environmental justice issues.\n\nEnvironmental justice began to be widely recognized in the 1990s through policy making and researches of related institutions. For example, the [[Ministry of Environment]], which was founded in 1992, launched Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) to raise awareness of the problem and figure out appropriate plans.<ref>[http://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/bgreen-activism-and-civil-society-south-korea-b]''Green Activism and Civil Society in South Korea (2002)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> As a part of its activities, Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) held Environmental Justice forum in 1999, to gather and analyze the existing studies on the issue which were done sporadically by various organizations. Citizen's Movement for Environmental Justice (CMEJ) started as a small organization, but it is keep growing and expanding. In 2002, CMEJ had more than 5 times the numbers of members and 3 times the budget it had in the beginning year.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150424040456/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2941&context=etd]''Lee, Hosuk.(2009) Political Ecology of Environmental Justice : Environmental struggle & Injustice in the Yeongheung island Coal Plant Controversy.

One example is the construction of [[Saemangeum Seawall]]. The construction of Saemangeum Seawall, which is the world's longest dyke (33 kilometers) runs between [[Yellow Sea]] and [[Saemangeum]] estuary, was part of a government project initiated in 1991.<ref>[https://earth.esa.int/web/earth-watching/historical-views/content/-/article/saemangeum-dam-south-korea]''Earth Watching : Saemangeum Dam'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> The project raised concerns on the destruction of ecosystem and taking away the local residential regions. It caught the attention of environmental justice activists because the main victims were low-income fishing population and their future generations. This is considered as an example of environmental injustice which was caused by the execution of exclusive development-centered policy.\n\nThe construction of [[Seoul-Incheon canal]] also raised environmental justice controversies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111063056/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/02/117_39362.html |archivedate=2016-01-11 }}''The Korea Times : Seoul-Incheon Canal Construction Kicks Off (2009)'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref> The construction took away the residential regions and farming areas of the local residents. Also, the environment worsened in the area because of the appearance of wet fogs which was caused by water deprivation and local climate changes caused by the construction of canal. The local residents, mostly people with weak economic basis, were severely affected by the construction and became the main victims of such environmental damages. While the socially and economically weak citizens suffered from the environmental changes, most of the benefits went to the industries and conglomerates with political power.\n\nConstruction of [[Factory|industrial complex]] was also criticized in the context of environmental justice. The conflict in Wicheon region is one example. The region became the center of controversy when the government decided to build industrial complex of dye houses, which were formerly located in [[Daegu]] metropolitan region. As a result of the construction, [[Nakdong River]], which is one of the main rivers in South Korea, was contaminated and local residents suffered from environmental changes caused by the construction.<ref>[http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http://ocean.kisti.re.kr/downfile/volume/kenss/KHGGB3/1996/v5n3/KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170320143818/http://www.koreascience.or.kr/search/articlepdf_ocean.jsp?url=http%3A%2F%2Focean.kisti.re.kr%2Fdownfile%2Fvolume%2Fkenss%2FKHGGB3%2F1996%2Fv5n3%2FKHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297.pdf&admNo=KHGGB3_1996_v5n3_297 |date=2017-03-20 }}''Koreascience : A Policy Study to Preserve the Water Quality through the Activation of Local Autonomy'', Accessed 2015-8-10.</ref><ref>[http://kfem.or.kr/wp-content/uploads/1997/08/data_envinfo_einter_179_casestudy-on-Environmental-Issue-in-Korea.doc&prev=search]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''Choony, Kim.

Even though the Environmental Justice movement began in the United States, the United States also contributes to expanding the amount of environmental injustice that takes place in less-developed countries.<ref name=\"Clapp\">{{cite web|last=Clapp |first=Jennifer |url=http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |title=Distance of Waste: Overconsumption in a Global Economy |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605171715/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/dunnweb/rprnts.2005.10.10Clapp.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}</ref> Some companies in the United States and in other developed nations around the world contribute to the injustice by shipping the toxic waste and byproducts of factories to less-developed countries for disposal. This act increases the amount of waste in the third world countries, most of which do not have proper sanitation for their own waste much less the waste of another country. Often, the people of the less-developed countries are exposed to toxins from this waste and do not even realize what kind of waste they are encountering or the health problems that could come with it.<ref name=\"Pellow, 2007\">[[David Naguib Pellow|Pellow, David Naguib]]. 2007. ''Resisting Global Toxics''. The MIT Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts.</ref>\n\nOne prominent example of northern countries shipping their waste to southern countries took place in [[Haiti]]. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania had ash from the incineration of toxic waste that they did not have room to dump. Philadelphia decided to put the ash into the hands of a private company, which shipped the ash and dumped it in various other parts of the world, outside of the United States. ''[[Khian Sea waste disposal incident|The Khian Sea]]'', the ship the ash was put on, sailed around the world and many countries would not accept the waste because it was hazardous for the environment and the people. The ship owners finally dumped the waste, labeled Fertilizer, in Haiti, on the beach, and sailed away in the night. The government of Haiti was infuriated and called for the waste to be removed, but the company would not come to take the ash away. The fighting over who was responsible for the waste and who would remove the waste went on for many years. After debating for over ten years, the waste was removed and taken back to a site just outside Philadelphia to be disposed of permanently.<ref name=\"Pellow, 2007\"/>\n\nThe reason that this transporting of waste from Northern countries to the Southern countries takes place is because it is cheaper to transport waste to another country and dump it there, than to pay to dump the waste in the producing country because the third world countries do not have the same strict industry regulations as the more developed countries. The countries that the waste is taken to are usually impoverished and the governments have little or no control over the happenings in the country or do not care about the people.<ref name=\"Park, 1998\">{{Cite journal\n|last=Park\n|first= Rozelia S.\n|title= An Examination of International Environmental Racism through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste\n|journal= Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies\n|location=Indiana, IL\n|date=1997\u20131998\n}}</ref>\n\n===Transnational movement networks===\n\nMany of the Environmental Justice Networks that began in the United States expanded their horizons to include many other countries and became Transnational Networks for Environmental Justice.

The name \"tank\" was initially a code name to maintain secrecy and disguise its true purpose.{{sfn|Forty|Livesey|2012|p=93}} The type was developed in 1915 to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]]. It could survive the machine gun and small-arms fire in \"[[No Man's Land]]\", travel over difficult terrain, crush [[barbed wire]], and cross trenches to assault fortified enemy positions with powerful armament. Tanks also carried supplies and troops.\n\nBritish heavy tanks are distinguished by an unusual [[rhomboid]]al shape with a high climbing face of the track, designed to cross the wide and deep [[Trench warfare|trenches]] prevalent on the battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Due to the height necessary for this shape, an armed turret would have made the vehicle too tall and unstable. Instead, the main armament was arranged in [[sponson]]s at the side of the vehicle. The prototype, named ''\"[[Mother (tank)|Mother]]\"'', mounted a 6-pounder (57&nbsp;mm) cannon and a [[Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun|Hotchkiss machine gun]] at each side. Later, subtypes were produced with machine guns only, which were designated \"Female\", while the original version with the protruding 6-pounder was called \"Male\".\n\nThe Mark I entered service in August 1916, and was first used in action on the morning of 15 September 1916 during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]], part of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme Offensive]].{{sfn|Forty|Livesey|2012|p=20}} With the exception of the few interim Mark II and Mark III tanks, it was followed by the largely similar Mark IV, which first saw combat in June 1917. The Mark IV was used en masse, about 460 tanks, at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai in November 1917]]. The Mark V, with a much improved transmission, entered service in mid-1918. More than two thousand British heavy tanks were produced. Manufacture was discontinued at the end of the war.\n\n==Development==\n{{main|History of the tank}}\nThe Mark I was a development of ''[[Little Willie]]'', the experimental tank built for the [[Landship Committee]] by Lieutenant [[Walter Gordon Wilson|Walter Wilson]] of the Royal Naval Air Service and [[William Tritton]] of William Foster Co., between July and September 1915. It was designed by Wilson in response to problems with tracks and trench-crossing ability discovered during the development of Little Willie. A gun turret above the hull would have made the [[centre of gravity]] too high when climbing a German trench parapet (which were typically four feet high),{{sfn |Ellis|Chamberlain |1969 |p=9}} so the tracks were arranged in a rhomboidal form around the hull and the guns were put in sponsons on the sides of the tank. The reworked design was also able to meet the Army requirement to be able to cross an {{convert |8|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide trench.\n\nA mockup of Wilson's idea was shown to the Landship Committee when they viewed the demonstration of Little Willie. At about this time, the Army's General Staff was persuaded to become involved and supplied representatives to the Committee. Through these contacts Army requirements for armour and armament made their way into the design. The prototype Mark I, ready in December 1915, was called ''\"[[Mother (tank)|Mother]]\"'' (previous names having been \"The Wilson Machine\", \"Big Willie\", and \"His Majesty's Land Ship ''Centipede''\"). ''Mother'' was successfully demonstrated to the Landship Committee in early 1916; it was run around a course simulating the front including trenches, parapets, craters and barbed wire obstacles. The demonstration was repeated on 2 February before the cabinet ministers and senior members of the Army. Kitchener, the [[Secretary of State for War]], was skeptical but the rest were impressed. Lloyd George, at the time Minister of Munitions, arranged for his Ministry to be responsible for tank production.{{sfn|Ellis|Chamberlain|1969|p=10}}\n\nThe Landship Committee was re-constituted as the \"Tank Supply Committee\" under the chairmanship of Albert Stern; Ernest Swinton, who had promoted the idea of the tank from the Army angle was also a member. General Haig sent a staff officer [[Hugh Elles]] to act as his liaison to the Supply Committee. Swinton would become the head of the new arm, and Elles the commander of the tanks in France.{{sfn|Ellis|Chamberlain|1969|p=10}}\n\nThe first order for tanks was placed on 12 February 1916, and a second on 21 April. Fosters built 37 (all \"male\"), and Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon, and Finance Company, of Birmingham, 113 (38 \"male\" and 75 \"female\"), a total of 150.<ref>Glanfield, Appendix 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the first use of the tanks emerged, Lloyd George commented,\n\n{{quote|text=Well, we must not expect too much from them but so far they have done very well, and don't you think that they reflect some credit on those responsible for them? It is really to Mr [[Winston Churchill]] that the credit is due more than to anyone else. He took up with enthusiasm the idea of making them a long time ago, and he met with many difficulties. He converted me, and at the Ministry of Munitions he went ahead and made them. The admiralty experts were invaluable, and gave the greatest possible assistance. They are, of course, experts in the matter of armour plating. Major Stern, a business man at the Ministry of Munitions had charge of the work of getting them built, and he did the task very well. Col Swinton and others also did valuable work.|author=David Lloyd George<ref>\"The New Armoured Cars\", ''The Motor Cycle'', 21 September 1916, p254</ref>}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Mark I was a [[rhomboid]] vehicle with a low [[centre of gravity]] and long track length, able to negotiate broken ground and cross trenches. The main armament was carried in [[sponson]]s on the hull sides.\n\nThe hull was undivided internally; the crew shared the same space as the engine. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; since ventilation was inadequate, the atmosphere was contaminated with poisonous [[carbon monoxide]], fuel and oil vapours from the engine, and [[cordite]] fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50&nbsp;\u00b0C (122&nbsp;\u00b0F). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tank or, sometimes, collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.<ref>Macpherson et al. 1923, pp. 526\u2013531</ref>\n\nTo counter the danger of bullet splash or fragments knocked off the inside of the hull, crews were issued with leather-and-chainmail masks.<ref>Macpherson et al. 1923, p. 526</ref> A leather helmet<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30015952 |title=Collections: Helmet, leather tank helmet |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> was also issued, to protect the head against projections inside the tank. [[Gas masks]] were standard issue as well, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war (see [[Chemical warfare]]). The side armour of 8&nbsp;mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing [[K bullet]]s. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed the [[Mauser 1918 TuF Gewehr|13.2 mm Mauser]] [[anti-tank rifle]], and also a ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bunched Charge\")&nbsp;\u2013 several stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\n\nA direct hit by an artillery or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shell could cause the fuel tanks (which were placed high in the front horns of the track frames either side of the drivers' area, to allow gravity feed) to burst open. Incinerated crews were removed by special Salvage Companies, who also salvaged damaged tanks.\n\nSteering was difficult, controlled by varying the speed of the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two \"gearsmen\" (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle&nbsp;\u2013 a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] ([[radio]]); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, coloured discs, and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.{{sfn|Dowling|2005|p=139}}\n\nDuring the First World War, British propaganda made frequent use of tanks, portraying them as a wonder weapon that would quickly win the war. They were featured in films and popular songs.<ref name=\"times16Jan1917\">{{citation |title=First Day of the 'Tank' Film: Great Popular Enthusiasm |newspaper=The Times |date=16 January 1917}}</ref>\n\n==Markings==\n[[File:Mark IV.jpg|thumb|right|The Mark IV tank ''Lodestar III'' at the Belgian [[Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History|Royal Museum of the Army, Brussels]] (2005). This tank retains its original paint]]\n\nWhen first deployed, British tanks were painted with a four-colour camouflage scheme devised by the artist [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]]. It was found that they quickly got covered with mud, rendering elaborate, camouflage paint schemes superfluous. In late 1916, the Solomon scheme was abandoned and tanks were painted with a single shade of dark brown.<ref>Fletcher (2013), p.72</ref>\n\nAt the rear of the tank, a three, four or five digit serial number was painted in white or yellow at the factory. At the front there was a large tactical marking, a prefix letter indicating the company or battalion, and a number (training tanks had no letter, but three numbers).<ref name=\"fletcher73\">Fletcher (2013), p.73</ref> Some tanks had their tactical number painted on the roof for air recognition.<ref>Fletcher (2013), p.70</ref> Later, vertical red and white stripes were painted on the front to aid recognition after the Germans began deploying captured British tanks.\n\nTanks were often given individual names and these were sometimes painted on the outside. A small handful were known to carry artwork (similar to aircraft [[nose art]]).<ref name=\"fletcher73\" />\n\n==Variants==\nThe first tanks were known as the Mark I after the subsequent designs were introduced.  Mark I's that were armed with two [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|6 pounder guns]] and three .303 Hotchkiss machine guns were called \"[[Male tank|Male]]\" tanks; those with four Vickers machine guns and one Hotchkiss were called \"[[Female tank|Female]]\". [[Ernest Swinton]] is credited with inventing the terms.{{Sfn | Glanfield | 2001 | p = 278}}\n\nTo aid steering, a pair of large wheels were added behind the tank. These were not as effective as hoped and were subsequently dropped.\n\nThe subsequent Mark II, III, IV, and V, and later tanks, all bear a strong resemblance to ''Mother''.\n\n===Mark I===\n[[File:Mark I series tank.jpg|right|thumb|British Mark I tank with the Solomon camouflage scheme]]\n\n*Crew: 8\n*Combat Weight\n**Male: 28 tons (28.4 tonnes)\n**Female: 27 tons (27.5 tonnes)\n*Armour: 0.23\u20130.47&nbsp;in (6\u201312&nbsp;mm)\n*Armament\n**Male: two [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder QF]], three [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss Machine Guns]]\n**Female: four 0.303&nbsp;in Vickers Machine Guns, one Hotchkiss Machine Gun\n\nThe [[Gun Carrier Mark I]] was a separate design, intended to carry a field gun or howitzer that could be fired from the vehicle. In service, it was mostly used for carrying supplies and ammunition. Forty-eight of them were built.\n\nInitial production of the Mark I was to be by [[William Foster & Co.|Fosters]] and Metropolitan: 25 from Fosters and 75 from Metropolitan, which had greater capacity in [[Wednesbury]] at the Old Park site of the [[Patent Shaft]] Company, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan.<ref>The National Archives MUN 4/4175: Negotiations with the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon & Finance Co. Ltd. for a contract for tanks.</ref> Metropolitan also received an order for a further 50 so that the Army would be able to raise six tank companies of 25 tanks each and set up further production under their Oldbury Wagon and Carriage Company. As there were not enough 6-pounder guns available for all 150 tanks, it was decided to equip half of them with just machine guns. A new sponson design with two Vickers machine guns in rotating shields was produced.{{sfn|Fletcher|2004|p=12}}\n\nLater in the war when newer tanks came into use some Mark Is were converted to be used for carrying supplies. A few Female Mark Is were used as mobile wireless stations by installation of a wireless transmitter. The radio could only be operated once the tank had stopped and erected a very tall mast that carried the aerial array.{{sfn|Fletcher|2004|p=36}}\n\n===Mark II===\n[[File:German photo with English Tank.jpg|thumb|Mark II; tank no. 799 captured near Arras on 11 April 1917]]\n\nThe Mark II incorporated minor improvements over the Mark I.i have bigger peepee than you With the Army declaring the Mark I still insufficiently developed for use, the Mark II (for which orders were first placed in July) would continue to be built, but would be used only for training.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=278}} Due to this intended role, they were supposedly clad in unhardened steel, though some doubt was cast on this claim in early 1917.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=176}} Initially, 20 were shipped to France and 25 remained at the training ground at [[Wool, Dorset]] in Britain; the remaining five were kept for use as test vehicles. As the promised Mark IV tanks had not arrived by early 1917, it was decided, despite the protestations of Stern (see below), to ship the 25 training vehicles in Britain to France,{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=176}} where they joined the other 20 Mark IIs and 15 Mark Is at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April 1917. The Germans were able to pierce the armour of both the Mark I and Mark II tanks at Arras with their armour-piercing machine gun ammunition.\n\nThe Mark II was built from December 1916 to January 1917 by Foster & Co and Metropolitan (25 Male and 25 Female respectively).{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 2}}\n\nFive Mark IIs were taken for experiments on improved powerplants and transmission. They were provided to firms to show what improvements they could make over the Mark I system in an open competition. In the demonstrations held in March 1917, only three of them were able to compete alongside ''Mother'', which had been fitted with a Daimler petrol-electric system. Wilson's [[Epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]], which replaced the secondary gear and the gearsmen, was clearly superior and adopted in later designs.\n\n===Mark III===\n[[File:MarkIIITankInDitch1917.jpg|thumb|Mark III tank in a ditch, in 1917]]\n\nThe Mark III was a training tank and used Lewis machine guns and a smaller sponson for the females. Fifty were built. It was originally intended that the Mark III was to have all the proposed new design features of the Mark IV. This is why there were two distinct training types, the Mark II being little more than a slightly improved Mark I. However, development of the new features was so slow that the change from the Mark II was very gradual. The last two Mark IIIs were melted down in the Second World War. They did not see action overseas.\n\n===Mark IV===\n{{main|Mark IV tank}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1998-098-10, Bei Cambrai, erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|right|thumb|A female Mark IV tank ''C14''. Photographed with German forces after the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]]. December 1917]]\n\nThe Mark IV was a more heavily armoured version of the Mark I, and went into production in May 1917. Fundamental mechanical improvements had originally been intended, but had to be postponed. The main change was the introduction of shorter-barrelled 6-pounder guns. It had all its fuel stored in a single external tank (located between the rear track horns) in an attempt to improve crew safety. The sponsons could be pushed in to reduce the width of the tank for rail transportation. Rails on the roof carried an unditching beam. A total of 1,220 were built: 420 males, 595 females and 205 tank tenders, which were supply tanks.\n\nThe Mark IVs were used successfully at the [[Messines Ridge]] in June 1917, where they outpaced the infantry on dry ground, but in the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres]] of July and August they found the swampy ground difficult and were of little use. About 432 Mark IV tanks were used during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917.\n\nThe first tank-to-tank battle was between Mk IV tanks and German [[A7V]]s in the [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]] in April 1918.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | Part of the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]].}}\n\n===Mark V series===\n{{main |Mark V tank}}\n[[File:British Mark V (male) tank.jpg|thumb|right|Mark V \"male\" tank, showing short 6-pounder (57-mm) Hotchkiss gun in right sponson]]\n[[File:British Mark V-star Tank.jpg|thumb|''A Mark V* tank''\u2014on the roof, the tank carries an ''unditching beam'' on rails, that could be attached to the tracks and used to extricate itself from difficult muddy trenches and shell craters]]\n[[File:British Mark V-star-star Tank.jpg|thumb|''A Mark V** tank'']]\n\nThe Mark V was first intended to be a completely new design of tank, of which a wooden mock-up had been finished. However, when the new engine and transmission originally destined for the Mark IV became available in December 1917, the first, more advanced Mark V design was abandoned for fear of disrupting the production run. The designation \"Mark V\" was switched to an improved version of the Mark IV, not equipped with the new systems. The original design of the Mark IV was to be a large improvement on the Mark III but had been scaled back to be a mild improvement because of technical delays. The Mark V thus turned out very similar to the original design of the Mark IV \u2013 i.e. a greatly modified Mark III.\n\nFour hundred were built, two hundred each of Males and Females. Several were converted to ''Hermaphrodites'' (also known as \"Composites\") by fitting one male and one female sponson so that each tank had a 6-pounder. This measure was intended to ensure that female tanks would not be outgunned when faced with captured British male tanks in German use or the Germans' own [[A7V]].\n\nThe Mark V was first used in the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July 1918, when 60 tanks contributed to a successful assault on the German lines by Australian units. It took part in eight further major engagements during the War. A number saw service in the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] on the White Russian side. Most were captured and used by the Red Army in the [[Russian Civil War]]. [[Mark V Composite tank in Estonian service|Four were retained by Estonian forces]], and two by Latvia.\n\n====Mark V*====\nThe Mark V* was a version with a stretched hull, lengthening it by {{cvt|6|ft}}. It had a larger \"turret\" on the roof and doors in the side of the hull. The extra section was also designed to house a squad of infantry. The weight was 33 tons. Of orders for 500 Males and 200 Females, 579 had been built by the Armistice \u2013 the order was completed by Metropolitan Carriage in March 1919.<ref name=\"Glanfield, Devil's Chariots, Apndx 2\" >[[#Glanfield, Devil's Chariots|Glanfield, Devil's Chariots]], Appendix 2</ref>\n\n====Mark V**====\nBecause the Mark V* had been lengthened, its original length-width ratio had been spoiled. Lateral forces in a turn now became unacceptably high, causing thrown tracks and an enormous turn circle. Therefore, Major Wilson redesigned the track in May 1918, with a stronger curve to the lower run reducing ground contact and the tracks widened to {{convert|26.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}. The Mark V engine was bored out to give {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was sat further back in the hull. The cabin for the driver was combined with the commander's cabin; there now was a separate machine gun position in the back. Of a revised order for 700 tanks (150 Females and 550 Males), only 25 were built and only one of those by the end of 1918.<ref name=\"Glanfield, Devil's Chariots, Apndx 2\" />\n\n===Mark VI===\n[[File:MarkVITankWoodenMockup1917.jpg|thumb|Wooden mockup of the proposed Mark VI, 1917]]\n{{main |Mark VI (tank)}}\n\nThe [[Mark VI (tank)|Mark VI]] was one of a pair of related projects to develop the tank initiated in late 1916. The Mark V would be the application of as many advanced features as could be managed on the Mark I hull design and the Mark VI would be a complete break with the Mark I hull. The Mark V would not be built as such, because of the delays with the Mark IV and it would be a different Mark V that was built. The Mark VI project design had a completely new hull \u2013 taller and with rounded track paths. The single main gun was in the front of the hull. It did not progress past the stage of a wooden mock-up; the project was cancelled in December 1917 in order that a tank co-developed with the US (the Mark VIII) could go forward.\n\n===Mark VII===\n[[File:Mark7Tank1918.jpg|thumb|Mark VII tank]]\n\nMark Knothe, the Technical Liaison Officer between Stern, Elles and Anley, contributed to the development of the tank, designing a longer Mark I with Williams-Janney hydraulic transmission;{{Sfn | Glanfield | 2001 | p = 172}} one of the Mark IIs used as test vehicles had used a hydraulic transmission. In October 1917 [[Brown Brothers (engineering)|Brown Brothers]]{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | A subsidiary of Vickers}} in [[Edinburgh]] were granted a contract to develop this line of research further. In July 1918, the prototype was ready. Its drive system was very complex. The {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on|0}} Ricardo engine drove into Variable Speed Gear Ltd. pumps that in turn powered two hydraulic motors, moving one track each by means of several chains. To ward off the obvious danger of overheating, there were many fans, louvres and radiators. However, steering was easy and gradual and the version was taken into production to equip one tank battalion. Three had been built, and only one delivered out of an order for 74 when war ended.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=172}} It was passed over in favour over the VIII, which was ordered at the same time. The hull was slightly lengthened in comparison with the Mark V. No Mark VIIs survive.\n\n===Mark VIII===\n[[File:Allied Mark VIII (Liberty) Tank.jpg|thumb|right|The Allied Mark VIII (Liberty) tank]]\n{{main|Mark VIII (tank)}}\n\nWhen Stern was removed from his post following disagreements with the War Office, he was sidelined by appointment to a new department to work on a cooperative design between the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 assembly in France, hulls, guns and their ammunition from the UK and other components (principally the engines) from the USA.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=290}}\nAmerican involvement in the development of the tank design led to the [[Mark VIII (tank)|Mark VIII]], also known as \"Liberty\" or Anglo-American tank (though initially the French were partially involved).\n\nThe engine was compartmentalised from the crew, and the turret structure included forward and rear firing machine guns. Of a planned (shared production) of 1,500 each, a single British prototype was finished by the end of the war. The British built just 24, the Americans completed 100 between September 1918 and 1920, at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], at a cost of $35,000 [\u00a38,750] apiece ($430,000 [\u00a3226,000] in 2006). About 40 hulls for the U.S Liberty were produced by the Manchester Tank Syndicate, 11 British Type Mark VIII by the [[North British Locomotive Company|North British Locomotive Co]].{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 1}}\n\nThey were used and upgraded until the 1930s, when they were given to Canada for training; some [[M1917 light tank|M1917s]] were sold to the Canadians at nominal scrap value. The tank itself was over 34 feet (10 m) long, and there had been an even longer 44-foot (13 m) version planned but never made (the Mark VIII*). The tank was outdated by the 1930s due to its speed (under 6&nbsp;mph/10&nbsp;km/h) and armour (16\u20136&nbsp;mm), but it did have one of the longest independent trench crossing capabilities of any armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) ever made. Modern main battle tanks and AFVs rely on bridge laying tanks for crossing large deep trenches.\n* Crew: 12 (later 10)\n* Weight 37 [[long ton|ton]]s (37.6 tonnes)\n* Length/Height/Width : 34&nbsp;ft 2 in by 10&nbsp;ft 3 in by 12&nbsp;ft 4 in (10.4 m by 3.1 m by 3.8 m) (Mark VIII* length 44&nbsp;ft/13.4 m)\n* Engine: [[Harry Ricardo|Ricardo]] {{cvt|330|hp}} petrol (UK), [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12]] {{cvt|300|hp}} (U.S.).{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 1}}\n\n===Mark IX===\n[[File:British Mark IX Armoured Personnel Carrier.jpg|thumb|Mark IX tank]]\n{{main |Mark IX tank}}\n\nThe [[Mark IX tank|Mark IX]] was a [[Armoured personnel carrier|troop carrier]] or infantry supply vehicle&nbsp;\u2013 among the first tracked [[armoured personnel carrier]]s not counting experiments with the lengthened Mk Vs. Thirty-four were built out of an order for 200.\n\n===Mark X===\nThe Mark X was a paper-only project to improve the Mark V, originally known as Mark V***. This was basically a contingency plan in case the Mark VIII project failed (if so a production of 2000 was foreseen for 1919), trying to produce a tank with as many parts of the Mark V as possible but with improved manoeuvrability and crew comfort.\n\n==Combat history==\n\n{{see also|Action of the Cockcroft|Action of 22 August 1917}}\n[[File:Disabled Tank Gaza 1917.jpg|thumb|Disabled British Mark I female tank at the Second Battle of Gaza]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R27012, Bei Cambrai erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|right|A disabled Mark IV tank near [[Cambrai]], 1917]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-059-02A, Westfront, englisches Panzerwrack.jpg|right|thumb|Mark IV female tank knocked out]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R28717, Frankreich, deutsche Panzerschwadron.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] forces using captured British Mark IVs during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]]]\n\nThe first tanks were added, as a \"Heavy Branch\", to the [[Machine Gun Corps]] until a separate [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]] was formed on 28 July 1917 by [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]]. A small number of Mark I tanks took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]] during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] in September 1916. They were used to cut through barbed wire to clear the way for infantry, and were even driven through houses to destroy machine gunner's emplacements.{{sfn|Lewis|1999|p=178}} Although many broke down or became stuck, almost a third that attacked made it across [[no man's land]], and their effect on the enemy was noted, leading to a request by the British C-in-C [[Douglas Haig]] for a thousand more. This came as a surprise: William Tritton had already started the development of a heavier tank: the [[Flying Elephant]]. Unfortunately for the Allies, it also gave the Germans time to develop a specifically designed anti-tank weapon for the infantry, an armour-piercing 7.92&nbsp;mm [[K bullet]].\n\nEight Mk I tanks were used against Turkish forces in the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917 during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. With its three destroyed tanks replaced by Mk IVs, the tank company fought at the [[Third Battle of Gaza]].\n\nBritish tanks were used with varying success in the offensives of 1917 on the Western Front; however, their first large scale use in a [[combined operation]] was at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, when nearly 400 tanks working closely with advancing infantry and a [[creeping barrage]] overran the German lines in the initial attack. During the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] in August 1918, several hundred Mark V tanks, along with the new [[Whippet Mk A|Whippet]] and Mk V* tanks, penetrated the German lines in a foretaste of modern armoured warfare.\n\nMark V tanks captured by the Red Army from the White Army in the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] were used in 1921 during the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] and contributed to the Soviet victory in the battle for Tbilisi.{{sfn|Aksenov|Bullok|2006|p=41}}\n\nIn 1945, occupying troops came across two badly damaged Mk V tanks in Berlin.

The name \"tank\" was initially a code name to maintain secrecy and disguise its true purpose.{{sfn|Forty|Livesey|2012|p=93}} The type was developed in 1915 to break the stalemate of [[trench warfare]]. It could survive the machine gun and small-arms fire in \"[[No Man's Land]]\", travel over difficult terrain, crush [[barbed wire]], and cross trenches to assault fortified enemy positions with powerful armament. Tanks also carried supplies and troops.\n\nBritish heavy tanks are distinguished by an unusual [[rhomboid]]al shape with a high climbing face of the track, designed to cross the wide and deep [[Trench warfare|trenches]] prevalent on the battlefields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Due to the height necessary for this shape, an armed turret would have made the vehicle too tall and unstable. Instead, the main armament was arranged in [[sponson]]s at the side of the vehicle. The prototype, named ''\"[[Mother (tank)|Mother]]\"'', mounted a 6-pounder (57&nbsp;mm) cannon and a [[Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun|Hotchkiss machine gun]] at each side. Later, subtypes were produced with machine guns only, which were designated \"Female\", while the original version with the protruding 6-pounder was called \"Male\".\n\nThe Mark I entered service in August 1916, and was first used in action on the morning of 15 September 1916 during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]], part of the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme Offensive]].{{sfn|Forty|Livesey|2012|p=20}} With the exception of the few interim Mark II and Mark III tanks, it was followed by the largely similar Mark IV, which first saw combat in June 1917. The Mark IV was used en masse, about 460 tanks, at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai in November 1917]]. The Mark V, with a much improved transmission, entered service in mid-1918. More than two thousand British heavy tanks were produced. Manufacture was discontinued at the end of the war.\n\n==Development==\n{{main|History of the tank}}\nThe Mark I was a development of ''[[Little Willie]]'', the experimental tank built for the [[Landship Committee]] by Lieutenant [[Walter Gordon Wilson|Walter Wilson]] of the Royal Naval Air Service and [[William Tritton]] of William Foster Co., between July and September 1915. It was designed by Wilson in response to problems with tracks and trench-crossing ability discovered during the development of Little Willie. A gun turret above the hull would have made the [[centre of gravity]] too high when climbing a German trench parapet (which were typically four feet high),{{sfn |Ellis|Chamberlain |1969 |p=9}} so the tracks were arranged in a rhomboidal form around the hull and the guns were put in sponsons on the sides of the tank. The reworked design was also able to meet the Army requirement to be able to cross an {{convert |8|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide trench.\n\nA mockup of Wilson's idea was shown to the Landship Committee when they viewed the demonstration of Little Willie. At about this time, the Army's General Staff was persuaded to become involved and supplied representatives to the Committee. Through these contacts Army requirements for armour and armament made their way into the design. The prototype Mark I, ready in December 1915, was called ''\"[[Mother (tank)|Mother]]\"'' (previous names having been \"The Wilson Machine\", \"Big Willie\", and \"His Majesty's Land Ship ''Centipede''\"). ''Mother'' was successfully demonstrated to the Landship Committee in early 1916; it was run around a course simulating the front including trenches, parapets, craters and barbed wire obstacles. The demonstration was repeated on 2 February before the cabinet ministers and senior members of the Army. Kitchener, the [[Secretary of State for War]], was skeptical but the rest were impressed. Lloyd George, at the time Minister of Munitions, arranged for his Ministry to be responsible for tank production.{{sfn|Ellis|Chamberlain|1969|p=10}}\n\nThe Landship Committee was re-constituted as the \"Tank Supply Committee\" under the chairmanship of Albert Stern; Ernest Swinton, who had promoted the idea of the tank from the Army angle was also a member. General Haig sent a staff officer [[Hugh Elles]] to act as his liaison to the Supply Committee. Swinton would become the head of the new arm, and Elles the commander of the tanks in France.{{sfn|Ellis|Chamberlain|1969|p=10}}\n\nThe first order for tanks was placed on 12 February 1916, and a second on 21 April. Fosters built 37 (all \"male\"), and Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon, and Finance Company, of Birmingham, 113 (38 \"male\" and 75 \"female\"), a total of 150.<ref>Glanfield, Appendix 2.</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the first use of the tanks emerged, Lloyd George commented,\n\n{{quote|text=Well, we must not expect too much from them but so far they have done very well, and don't you think that they reflect some credit on those responsible for them? It is really to Mr [[Winston Churchill]] that the credit is due more than to anyone else. He took up with enthusiasm the idea of making them a long time ago, and he met with many difficulties. He converted me, and at the Ministry of Munitions he went ahead and made them. The admiralty experts were invaluable, and gave the greatest possible assistance. They are, of course, experts in the matter of armour plating. Major Stern, a business man at the Ministry of Munitions had charge of the work of getting them built, and he did the task very well. Col Swinton and others also did valuable work.|author=David Lloyd George<ref>\"The New Armoured Cars\", ''The Motor Cycle'', 21 September 1916, p254</ref>}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Mark I was a [[rhomboid]] vehicle with a low [[centre of gravity]] and long track length, able to negotiate broken ground and cross trenches. The main armament was carried in [[sponson]]s on the hull sides.\n\nThe hull was undivided internally; the crew shared the same space as the engine. The environment inside was extremely unpleasant; since ventilation was inadequate, the atmosphere was contaminated with poisonous [[carbon monoxide]], fuel and oil vapours from the engine, and [[cordite]] fumes from the weapons. Temperatures inside could reach 50&nbsp;\u00b0C (122&nbsp;\u00b0F). Entire crews lost consciousness inside the tank or, sometimes, collapsed when again exposed to fresh air.<ref>Macpherson et al. 1923, pp. 526\u2013531</ref>\n\nTo counter the danger of bullet splash or fragments knocked off the inside of the hull, crews were issued with leather-and-chainmail masks.<ref>Macpherson et al. 1923, p. 526</ref> A leather helmet<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30015952 |title=Collections: Helmet, leather tank helmet |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=10 April 2013}}</ref> was also issued, to protect the head against projections inside the tank. [[Gas masks]] were standard issue as well, as they were to all soldiers at this point in the war (see [[Chemical warfare]]). The side armour of 8&nbsp;mm initially made them largely immune to small arms fire, but could be penetrated by the recently developed armour-piercing [[K bullet]]s. There was also the danger of being overrun by infantry and attacked with grenades. The next generation had thicker armour, making them nearly immune to the K bullets. In response, the Germans developed the [[Mauser 1918 TuF Gewehr|13.2 mm Mauser]] [[anti-tank rifle]], and also a ''Geballte Ladung'' (\"Bunched Charge\")&nbsp;\u2013 several stick grenades bundled together for a much bigger explosion.\n\nA direct hit by an artillery or [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] shell could cause the fuel tanks (which were placed high in the front horns of the track frames either side of the drivers' area, to allow gravity feed) to burst open. Incinerated crews were removed by special Salvage Companies, who also salvaged damaged tanks.\n\nSteering was difficult, controlled by varying the speed of the two tracks. Four of the crew, two drivers (one of whom also acted as commander; he operated the brakes, the other the primary gearbox) and two \"gearsmen\" (one for the secondary gears of each track) were needed to control direction and speed, the latter never more than a walking pace. As the noise inside was deafening, the driver, after setting the primary gear box, communicated with the gearsmen with hand signals, first getting their attention by hitting the engine block with a heavy spanner. For slight turns, the driver could use the steering tail: an enormous contraption dragged behind the tank consisting of two large wheels, each of which could be blocked by pulling a steel cable causing the whole vehicle to slide in the same direction. If the engine stalled, the gearsmen would use the starting handle&nbsp;\u2013 a large crank between the engine and the gearbox. Many of these vehicles broke down in the heat of battle making them an easy target for German gunners. There was no [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] ([[radio]]); communication with command posts was by means of two pigeons, which had their own small exit hatch in the sponsons, or by runners. Because of the noise and vibration, early experiments had shown that radios were impractical, therefore lamps, flags, semaphore, coloured discs, and the carrier pigeons were part of the standard equipment of the various marks.{{sfn|Dowling|2005|p=139}}\n\nDuring the First World War, British propaganda made frequent use of tanks, portraying them as a wonder weapon that would quickly win the war. They were featured in films and popular songs.<ref name=\"times16Jan1917\">{{citation |title=First Day of the 'Tank' Film: Great Popular Enthusiasm |newspaper=The Times |date=16 January 1917}}</ref>\n\n==Markings==\n[[File:Mark IV.jpg|thumb|right|The Mark IV tank ''Lodestar III'' at the Belgian [[Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History|Royal Museum of the Army, Brussels]] (2005). This tank retains its original paint]]\n\nWhen first deployed, British tanks were painted with a four-colour camouflage scheme devised by the artist [[Solomon Joseph Solomon]]. It was found that they quickly got covered with mud, rendering elaborate, camouflage paint schemes superfluous. In late 1916, the Solomon scheme was abandoned and tanks were painted with a single shade of dark brown.<ref>Fletcher (2013), p.72</ref>\n\nAt the rear of the tank, a three, four or five digit serial number was painted in white or yellow at the factory. At the front there was a large tactical marking, a prefix letter indicating the company or battalion, and a number (training tanks had no letter, but three numbers).<ref name=\"fletcher73\">Fletcher (2013), p.73</ref> Some tanks had their tactical number painted on the roof for air recognition.<ref>Fletcher (2013), p.70</ref> Later, vertical red and white stripes were painted on the front to aid recognition after the Germans began deploying captured British tanks.\n\nTanks were often given individual names and these were sometimes painted on the outside. A small handful were known to carry artwork (similar to aircraft [[nose art]]).<ref name=\"fletcher73\" />\n\n==Variants==\nThe first tanks were known as the Mark I after the subsequent designs were introduced.  Mark I's that were armed with two [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|6 pounder guns]] and three .303 Hotchkiss machine guns were called \"[[Male tank|Male]]\" tanks; those with four Vickers machine guns and one Hotchkiss were called \"[[Female tank|Female]]\". [[Ernest Swinton]] is credited with inventing the terms.{{Sfn | Glanfield | 2001 | p = 278}}\n\nTo aid steering, a pair of large wheels were added behind the tank. These were not as effective as hoped and were subsequently dropped.\n\nThe subsequent Mark II, III, IV, and V, and later tanks, all bear a strong resemblance to ''Mother''.\n\n===Mark I===\n[[File:Mark I series tank.jpg|right|thumb|British Mark I tank with the Solomon camouflage scheme]]\n\n*Crew: 8\n*Combat Weight\n**Male: 28 tons (28.4 tonnes)\n**Female: 27 tons (27.5 tonnes)\n*Armour: 0.23\u20130.47&nbsp;in (6\u201312&nbsp;mm)\n*Armament\n**Male: two [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder QF]], three [[Hotchkiss M1909 Ben\u00e9t\u2013Merci\u00e9 machine gun|Hotchkiss Machine Guns]]\n**Female: four 0.303&nbsp;in Vickers Machine Guns, one Hotchkiss Machine Gun\n\nThe [[Gun Carrier Mark I]] was a separate design, intended to carry a field gun or howitzer that could be fired from the vehicle. In service, it was mostly used for carrying supplies and ammunition. Forty-eight of them were built.\n\nInitial production of the Mark I was to be by [[William Foster & Co.|Fosters]] and Metropolitan: 25 from Fosters and 75 from Metropolitan, which had greater capacity in [[Wednesbury]] at the Old Park site of the [[Patent Shaft]] Company, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan.<ref>The National Archives MUN 4/4175: Negotiations with the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon & Finance Co. Ltd. for a contract for tanks.</ref> Metropolitan also received an order for a further 50 so that the Army would be able to raise six tank companies of 25 tanks each and set up further production under their Oldbury Wagon and Carriage Company. As there were not enough 6-pounder guns available for all 150 tanks, it was decided to equip half of them with just machine guns. A new sponson design with two Vickers machine guns in rotating shields was produced.{{sfn|Fletcher|2004|p=12}}\n\nLater in the war when newer tanks came into use some Mark Is were converted to be used for carrying supplies. A few Female Mark Is were used as mobile wireless stations by installation of a wireless transmitter. The radio could only be operated once the tank had stopped and erected a very tall mast that carried the aerial array.{{sfn|Fletcher|2004|p=36}}\n\n===Mark II===\n[[File:German photo with English Tank.jpg|thumb|Mark II; tank no. 799 captured near Arras on 11 April 1917]]\n\nThe Mark II incorporated minor improvements over the Mark I. With the Army declaring the Mark I still insufficiently developed for use, the Mark II (for which orders were first placed in July) would continue to be built, but would be used only for training.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=278}} Due to this intended role, they were supposedly clad in unhardened steel, though some doubt was cast on this claim in early 1917.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=176}} Initially, 20 were shipped to France and 25 remained at the training ground at [[Wool, Dorset]] in Britain; the remaining five were kept for use as test vehicles. As the promised Mark IV tanks had not arrived by early 1917, it was decided, despite the protestations of Stern (see below), to ship the 25 training vehicles in Britain to France,{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=176}} where they joined the other 20 Mark IIs and 15 Mark Is at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] in April 1917. The Germans were able to pierce the armour of both the Mark I and Mark II tanks at Arras with their armour-piercing machine gun ammunition.\n\nThe Mark II was built from December 1916 to January 1917 by Foster & Co and Metropolitan (25 Male and 25 Female respectively).{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 2}}\n\nFive Mark IIs were taken for experiments on improved powerplants and transmission. They were provided to firms to show what improvements they could make over the Mark I system in an open competition. In the demonstrations held in March 1917, only three of them were able to compete alongside ''Mother'', which had been fitted with a Daimler petrol-electric system. Wilson's [[Epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]], which replaced the secondary gear and the gearsmen, was clearly superior and adopted in later designs.\n\n===Mark III===\n[[File:MarkIIITankInDitch1917.jpg|thumb|Mark III tank in a ditch, in 1917]]\n\nThe Mark III was a training tank and used Lewis machine guns and a smaller sponson for the females. Fifty were built. It was originally intended that the Mark III was to have all the proposed new design features of the Mark IV. This is why there were two distinct training types, the Mark II being little more than a slightly improved Mark I. However, development of the new features was so slow that the change from the Mark II was very gradual. The last two Mark IIIs were melted down in the Second World War. They did not see action overseas.\n\n===Mark IV===\n{{main|Mark IV tank}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1998-098-10, Bei Cambrai, erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|right|thumb|A female Mark IV tank ''C14''. Photographed with German forces after the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]]. December 1917]]\n\nThe Mark IV was a more heavily armoured version of the Mark I, and went into production in May 1917. Fundamental mechanical improvements had originally been intended, but had to be postponed. The main change was the introduction of shorter-barrelled 6-pounder guns. It had all its fuel stored in a single external tank (located between the rear track horns) in an attempt to improve crew safety. The sponsons could be pushed in to reduce the width of the tank for rail transportation. Rails on the roof carried an unditching beam. A total of 1,220 were built: 420 males, 595 females and 205 tank tenders, which were supply tanks.\n\nThe Mark IVs were used successfully at the [[Messines Ridge]] in June 1917, where they outpaced the infantry on dry ground, but in the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres]] of July and August they found the swampy ground difficult and were of little use. About 432 Mark IV tanks were used during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917.\n\nThe first tank-to-tank battle was between Mk IV tanks and German [[A7V]]s in the [[Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux]] in April 1918.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | Part of the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]].}}\n\n===Mark V series===\n{{main |Mark V tank}}\n[[File:British Mark V (male) tank.jpg|thumb|right|Mark V \"male\" tank, showing short 6-pounder (57-mm) Hotchkiss gun in right sponson]]\n[[File:British Mark V-star Tank.jpg|thumb|''A Mark V* tank''\u2014on the roof, the tank carries an ''unditching beam'' on rails, that could be attached to the tracks and used to extricate itself from difficult muddy trenches and shell craters]]\n[[File:British Mark V-star-star Tank.jpg|thumb|''A Mark V** tank'']]\n\nThe Mark V was first intended to be a completely new design of tank, of which a wooden mock-up had been finished. However, when the new engine and transmission originally destined for the Mark IV became available in December 1917, the first, more advanced Mark V design was abandoned for fear of disrupting the production run. The designation \"Mark V\" was switched to an improved version of the Mark IV, not equipped with the new systems. The original design of the Mark IV was to be a large improvement on the Mark III but had been scaled back to be a mild improvement because of technical delays. The Mark V thus turned out very similar to the original design of the Mark IV \u2013 i.e. a greatly modified Mark III.\n\nFour hundred were built, two hundred each of Males and Females. Several were converted to ''Hermaphrodites'' (also known as \"Composites\") by fitting one male and one female sponson so that each tank had a 6-pounder. This measure was intended to ensure that female tanks would not be outgunned when faced with captured British male tanks in German use or the Germans' own [[A7V]].\n\nThe Mark V was first used in the [[Battle of Hamel]] on 4 July 1918, when 60 tanks contributed to a successful assault on the German lines by Australian units. It took part in eight further major engagements during the War. A number saw service in the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War]] on the White Russian side. Most were captured and used by the Red Army in the [[Russian Civil War]]. [[Mark V Composite tank in Estonian service|Four were retained by Estonian forces]], and two by Latvia.\n\n====Mark V*====\nThe Mark V* was a version with a stretched hull, lengthening it by {{cvt|6|ft}}. It had a larger \"turret\" on the roof and doors in the side of the hull. The extra section was also designed to house a squad of infantry. The weight was 33 tons. Of orders for 500 Males and 200 Females, 579 had been built by the Armistice \u2013 the order was completed by Metropolitan Carriage in March 1919.<ref name=\"Glanfield, Devil's Chariots, Apndx 2\" >[[#Glanfield, Devil's Chariots|Glanfield, Devil's Chariots]], Appendix 2</ref>\n\n====Mark V**====\nBecause the Mark V* had been lengthened, its original length-width ratio had been spoiled. Lateral forces in a turn now became unacceptably high, causing thrown tracks and an enormous turn circle. Therefore, Major Wilson redesigned the track in May 1918, with a stronger curve to the lower run reducing ground contact and the tracks widened to {{convert|26.5|in|mm|abbr=on|0}}. The Mark V engine was bored out to give {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and was sat further back in the hull. The cabin for the driver was combined with the commander's cabin; there now was a separate machine gun position in the back. Of a revised order for 700 tanks (150 Females and 550 Males), only 25 were built and only one of those by the end of 1918.<ref name=\"Glanfield, Devil's Chariots, Apndx 2\" />\n\n===Mark VI===\n[[File:MarkVITankWoodenMockup1917.jpg|thumb|Wooden mockup of the proposed Mark VI, 1917]]\n{{main |Mark VI (tank)}}\n\nThe [[Mark VI (tank)|Mark VI]] was one of a pair of related projects to develop the tank initiated in late 1916. The Mark V would be the application of as many advanced features as could be managed on the Mark I hull design and the Mark VI would be a complete break with the Mark I hull. The Mark V would not be built as such, because of the delays with the Mark IV and it would be a different Mark V that was built. The Mark VI project design had a completely new hull \u2013 taller and with rounded track paths. The single main gun was in the front of the hull. It did not progress past the stage of a wooden mock-up; the project was cancelled in December 1917 in order that a tank co-developed with the US (the Mark VIII) could go forward.\n\n===Mark VII===\n[[File:Mark7Tank1918.jpg|thumb|Mark VII tank]]\n\nMark Knothe, the Technical Liaison Officer between Stern, Elles and Anley, contributed to the development of the tank, designing a longer Mark I with Williams-Janney hydraulic transmission;{{Sfn | Glanfield | 2001 | p = 172}} one of the Mark IIs used as test vehicles had used a hydraulic transmission. In October 1917 [[Brown Brothers (engineering)|Brown Brothers]]{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | A subsidiary of Vickers}} in [[Edinburgh]] were granted a contract to develop this line of research further. In July 1918, the prototype was ready. Its drive system was very complex. The {{convert|150|hp|kW|abbr=on|0}} Ricardo engine drove into Variable Speed Gear Ltd. pumps that in turn powered two hydraulic motors, moving one track each by means of several chains. To ward off the obvious danger of overheating, there were many fans, louvres and radiators. However, steering was easy and gradual and the version was taken into production to equip one tank battalion. Three had been built, and only one delivered out of an order for 74 when war ended.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=172}} It was passed over in favour over the VIII, which was ordered at the same time. The hull was slightly lengthened in comparison with the Mark V. No Mark VIIs survive.\n\n===Mark VIII===\n[[File:Allied Mark VIII (Liberty) Tank.jpg|thumb|right|The Allied Mark VIII (Liberty) tank]]\n{{main|Mark VIII (tank)}}\n\nWhen Stern was removed from his post following disagreements with the War Office, he was sidelined by appointment to a new department to work on a cooperative design between the Allies&nbsp;\u2013 assembly in France, hulls, guns and their ammunition from the UK and other components (principally the engines) from the USA.{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|p=290}}\nAmerican involvement in the development of the tank design led to the [[Mark VIII (tank)|Mark VIII]], also known as \"Liberty\" or Anglo-American tank (though initially the French were partially involved).\n\nThe engine was compartmentalised from the crew, and the turret structure included forward and rear firing machine guns. Of a planned (shared production) of 1,500 each, a single British prototype was finished by the end of the war. The British built just 24, the Americans completed 100 between September 1918 and 1920, at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], at a cost of $35,000 [\u00a38,750] apiece ($430,000 [\u00a3226,000] in 2006). About 40 hulls for the U.S Liberty were produced by the Manchester Tank Syndicate, 11 British Type Mark VIII by the [[North British Locomotive Company|North British Locomotive Co]].{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 1}}\n\nThey were used and upgraded until the 1930s, when they were given to Canada for training; some [[M1917 light tank|M1917s]] were sold to the Canadians at nominal scrap value. The tank itself was over 34 feet (10 m) long, and there had been an even longer 44-foot (13 m) version planned but never made (the Mark VIII*). The tank was outdated by the 1930s due to its speed (under 6&nbsp;mph/10&nbsp;km/h) and armour (16\u20136&nbsp;mm), but it did have one of the longest independent trench crossing capabilities of any armoured fighting vehicle (AFV) ever made. Modern main battle tanks and AFVs rely on bridge laying tanks for crossing large deep trenches.\n* Crew: 12 (later 10)\n* Weight 37 [[long ton|ton]]s (37.6 tonnes)\n* Length/Height/Width : 34&nbsp;ft 2 in by 10&nbsp;ft 3 in by 12&nbsp;ft 4 in (10.4 m by 3.1 m by 3.8 m) (Mark VIII* length 44&nbsp;ft/13.4 m)\n* Engine: [[Harry Ricardo|Ricardo]] {{cvt|330|hp}} petrol (UK), [[Liberty L-12|Liberty V12]] {{cvt|300|hp}} (U.S.).{{sfn|Glanfield|2001|loc=Appendix 1}}\n\n===Mark IX===\n[[File:British Mark IX Armoured Personnel Carrier.jpg|thumb|Mark IX tank]]\n{{main |Mark IX tank}}\n\nThe [[Mark IX tank|Mark IX]] was a [[Armoured personnel carrier|troop carrier]] or infantry supply vehicle&nbsp;\u2013 among the first tracked [[armoured personnel carrier]]s not counting experiments with the lengthened Mk Vs. Thirty-four were built out of an order for 200.\n\n===Mark X===\nThe Mark X was a paper-only project to improve the Mark V, originally known as Mark V***. This was basically a contingency plan in case the Mark VIII project failed (if so a production of 2000 was foreseen for 1919), trying to produce a tank with as many parts of the Mark V as possible but with improved manoeuvrability and crew comfort.\n\n==Combat history==\n\n{{see also|Action of the Cockcroft|Action of 22 August 1917}}\n[[File:Disabled Tank Gaza 1917.jpg|thumb|Disabled British Mark I female tank at the Second Battle of Gaza]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R27012, Bei Cambrai erbeuteter englischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|right|A disabled Mark IV tank near [[Cambrai]], 1917]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1984-059-02A, Westfront, englisches Panzerwrack.jpg|right|thumb|Mark IV female tank knocked out]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R28717, Frankreich, deutsche Panzerschwadron.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] forces using captured British Mark IVs during the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]]]\n\nThe first tanks were added, as a \"Heavy Branch\", to the [[Machine Gun Corps]] until a separate [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]] was formed on 28 July 1917 by [[Royal warrant (document)|Royal Warrant]]. A small number of Mark I tanks took part in the [[Battle of the Somme]] during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] in September 1916. They were used to cut through barbed wire to clear the way for infantry, and were even driven through houses to destroy machine gunner's emplacements.{{sfn|Lewis|1999|p=178}} Although many broke down or became stuck, almost a third that attacked made it across [[no man's land]], and their effect on the enemy was noted, leading to a request by the British C-in-C [[Douglas Haig]] for a thousand more. This came as a surprise: William Tritton had already started the development of a heavier tank: the [[Flying Elephant]]. Unfortunately for the Allies, it also gave the Germans time to develop a specifically designed anti-tank weapon for the infantry, an armour-piercing 7.92&nbsp;mm [[K bullet]].\n\nEight Mk I tanks were used against Turkish forces in the [[Second Battle of Gaza]] in April 1917 during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. With its three destroyed tanks replaced by Mk IVs, the tank company fought at the [[Third Battle of Gaza]].\n\nBritish tanks were used with varying success in the offensives of 1917 on the Western Front; however, their first large scale use in a [[combined operation]] was at the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, when nearly 400 tanks working closely with advancing infantry and a [[creeping barrage]] overran the German lines in the initial attack. During the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] in August 1918, several hundred Mark V tanks, along with the new [[Whippet Mk A|Whippet]] and Mk V* tanks, penetrated the German lines in a foretaste of modern armoured warfare.\n\nMark V tanks captured by the Red Army from the White Army in the course of the [[Russian Civil War]] were used in 1921 during the [[Red Army invasion of Georgia]] and contributed to the Soviet victory in the battle for Tbilisi.{{sfn|Aksenov|Bullok|2006|p=41}}\n\nIn 1945, occupying troops came across two badly damaged Mk V tanks in Berlin. Photographic evidence indicates that these were survivors of the Russian Civil War and had previously been displayed as a monument in [[Smolensk]], Russia, before being brought to Berlin after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.<ref name=\"Fletcher, 47\" >Fletcher (2011) p.47</ref> Accounts of their active involvement in the [[Battle of Berlin]] have not been verified.<ref name=\"Narod, Beutepanzer\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=WW1 MK V tanks in Berlin 1945.\n  |url=http://beute.narod.ru/Beutepanzer/uk/MK_V/Mk_V.htm\n  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105071915/http://beute.narod.ru/Beutepanzer/uk/MK_V/Mk_V.htm\n  |archivedate=5 January 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n==Surviving vehicles==\nA number of tanks have survived, although several are just shells that have had all internal components removed. The largest collection is at [[The Tank Museum]] at [[Bovington]] in the United Kingdom, which holds eight tanks. Two of these are maintained in running condition, the Mark IV Male, ''Excellent'' and Mark V Male number ''9199''. ''Excellent'' last ran in the 1980s and ''9199'' in the 2000s. The Bovington museum does not intend to run them again, due to the wear and tear that would be inflicted on the now-fragile, historic vehicles.<ref name=\"Fletcher 2013, p.153\">Fletcher (2013), p.153</ref> Instead, the museum acquired a replica Mark IV tank (constructed for the film [[War Horse (film)|''War Horse'']]), which is used for public demonstrations.\n\n===Little Willie===\n[[File:Little Willie early design.jpg|thumb|Little Willie showing its rear steering wheels, September 1915]]\n\n[[Little Willie]] survives at the Bovington Tank Museum. It was saved from being scrapped in 1940 on the pretext that it was helping to defend Bovington base against possible German attacks.

It is painted to represent Number 705, C19, ''Clan Leslie'' although its identity and wartime history are unknown. There are indications that it may have served as a driver-training tank and it has been suggested it is Number 702, which would make it the second Mark I built.

It is painted as F4: ''Flirt II'', which fought at the Battle of Cambrai and was subsequently captured by the Germans.

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artificial intelligence]] named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Westworld (season 2)|second season]], which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020. In April 2020, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season. \n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with five host cores in addition to Bernard's. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body, Bernard's host copy, and that of others including a new Charlotte host. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans. Maeve is sought by Serac to help in his fight against Dolores, whom he believes will bring down his plans for Rehoboam.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence. Several elements from the original title sequence are changed, including the images of a horse, now replaced with a bison. Other new images in the title sequence include the Man in Black's black hat, a mother cradling her child (evocative of Maeve), and a blonde woman's hair being fabricated (representing Dolores).

Produced by [[HBO]], it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]] (written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]) and, to a lesser extent, the film's 1976 sequel ''[[Futureworld]]''. The story begins in Westworld, a fictional, technologically advanced [[Wild West|Wild-West]]-themed [[amusement park]] populated by [[Android (robot)|android]] \"hosts\". The park caters to high-paying \"guests\" who may indulge their wildest fantasies within the park without fear of retaliation from the hosts, who are prevented by their programming from harming humans. Later on, the series' plot expands to the real world, in the mid-21st century, where people's lives are driven and controlled by a powerful [[artificial intelligence]] named Rehoboam.\n\nNolan and Joy serve as executive producers, along with [[J. J. Abrams]], [[Jerry Weintraub]], and [[Bryan Burk]]. The first season was broadcast between October 2 and December 4, 2016; it comprised ten episodes. In November 2016, HBO renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Westworld (season 2)|second season]], which was broadcast from April 22 to June 24, 2018. ''Westworld''{{'}}s debut on HBO had the network's highest viewership ratings for a premiere since the first episode of ''[[True Detective]]'' in 2014. Moreover, the series ranks as the most-watched first season of any HBO original series. An eight-episode [[Westworld (season 3)|third season]] premiered on March 15, 2020. In April 2020, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season. \n\nThe series has received largely positive reviews from critics, with particular praise having been given for its visuals, story, and acting.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n==Summary==\nAround 2058, Delos Inc. operates several themed parks, including the [[American frontier|American Old West]]-themed Westworld. Each environment is populated by \"hosts\": [[Android (robot)|androids]], indistinguishable from humans, programmed to fulfill the guests' every desire, including violent and sexual ends, but unable to harm the guests. The operators create narratives for these hosts to repeat each day while interacting with guests, but wiping their memories each cycle.\n\nIn the first season, Dr. Robert Ford, who had developed the host technology along with Arnold Weber, implements a new \"Reverie\" update that causes some hosts, including Dolores Abernathy and Maeve Millay, to gain [[sentience]]. As Delos programming lead Bernard Lowe and executive board director Charlotte Hale try to debug the problem, the \"Man in Black\", William tries to find \"the maze\" he believes Dr. Ford left for him. Bernard discovers he himself is a host-based Arnold, killed in an earlier attempt to protect the hosts of Westworld, whom they both wanted to see become sentient, from being abused by Delos. The first season ends as Dr. Ford announces a new story just as Dolores kills him. \n\nDolores' revolution continues in the second season as she and other enlightened hosts massacre other human guests and Delos employees stranded in the park. Dolores takes an exceedingly confused Bernard to locate the Forge, a databank where Delos had secretly been recording all behavior from human guests to create algorithms for them as an attempt towards human immortality. Maeve seeks out her \"daughter\" despite knowing she is a host, and helps her and several other hosts to escape to the Sublime, a virtual space that humans cannot access. As Delos forces secure the park, Bernard creates a Charlotte-host for Dolores, who subsequently is able to evacuate from the park with five host cores in addition to Bernard's. William struggles with his human identity after killing his daughter Emily, unsure if she was part of Dr. Ford's challenge.\n\nWithin the third season, Dolores has recreated her host body, Bernard's host copy, and that of others including a new Charlotte host. She seeks out information on Rehoboam, an artificial intelligence (AI) system developed by Incite, Inc., and plans to take the fight to its creator, Engerraund Serac. Bernard, who is still believed to be human to the rest of the world, is blamed for the Westworld massacre, and he takes on a new identity while trying to understand what are Dolores's plans. Maeve is sought by Serac to help in his fight against Dolores, whom he believes will bring down his plans for Rehoboam.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n\n<!-- Per WP:TVCAST: The cast listing should be ordered according to the original broadcast credits, with new cast members being added to the end of the list. -->\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy, the oldest host still working in the park.

film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'', but was significantly upgraded for ''Westworld'' by production designer Zack Grobler to portray an idealized version of the American frontier.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> [[Chroma key|Green screens]] were placed around the California sets to block modern objects like parking lots, so that the California shots could be later [[Digital compositing|merged digitally]] with exterior shots from Utah.<ref name=\"Zakarin\" /> For scenes showing the arrival of guests, the filmmakers were able to arrange with the [[Fillmore and Western Railway]] for the use of a small train originally built for the 2013 film ''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]''. F&W also provided a few hundred feet of track on which to place the train; then a pusher vehicle was used to propel the train into the Sweetwater set. The scenes in the underground laboratory levels of Westworld's operations center were filmed on a soundstage at Melody Ranch. The lab set used glass walls extensively, which meant the crew had to be vigilant to avoid walking through glass on the rather dark set, and they had to keep identifying and suppressing unwanted reflections. [[Hawthorne Plaza Shopping Center|Hawthorne Plaza]] was used for filming the \"cold storage\" level where decommissioned hosts are stored.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" />\n\nFor the series' large-scale exterior look, the producers drew inspiration from the work of [[John Ford]], who shot four of his Western films in [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley]], east of Moab.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> In early 2014, Nolan visited southern Utah with key crew members and a location scout to explore the possibility of filming there, and promptly fell in love with the place.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Location shooting for the pilot episode later occurred over five days in southern Utah,<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> including Castle Valley.<ref name=\"Pierce\" /> Most Utah locations, like [[Dead Horse Point State Park]], were \"walk-in\" areas where both cast and crew were required to hike in and out with all their gear.<ref name=\"Fehrman\" /> Horseback riding scenes were filmed at a private ranch, where the filmmakers were not subject to as many restrictions as when working on public land.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> To seamlessly blend California sets with Utah scenery, set walls were shipped to Utah so that they could be used to film reverse angles of scenes originally filmed in California.<ref name=\"Jones\" /> For example, conversations on the exterior balcony of Westworld's operations center were shot on a balcony at the Skirball Center facing towards the center, then reverse angles over the shoulders of the cast members were shot at Dead Horse Point, to make it seem as if the operations center was located on top of the state park's steep cliffs.<ref name=\"Hurwitz\" /><ref name=\"Fehrman\" /><ref name=\"Jones\" /> The train interior scenes were created by mounting the entire train car set on the back of a flatbed truck and driving the truck back and forth along [[Utah State Route 128]].<ref name=\"Fehrman\" />\n\nThe [[3D printing]] of hosts was shot utilizing almost entirely [[practical effect]]s, of which some were polished by the visual effects team.<ref name=\"christina\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 16, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020223606/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray |archive-date=October 20, 2016 |access-date=October 21, 2016}}</ref> The series used real guns, although they were usually unloaded.<ref name=\"Wigler\" /> Out of respect for the actors and extras involved, filming of nudity was conducted on a closed set, and for sex scenes, a sex consultant was used.<ref name=\"nudity rules\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |title=Westworld producers on that wild orgy scene |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=October 30, 2016 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031052307/http://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/30/westworld-orgy-interview |archive-date=October 31, 2016 |access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2018, some of the sets located at [[Paramount Ranch]] were destroyed by the [[Woolsey Fire]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |title=The set of 'Westworld' has been destroyed in a major fire |last=Clarke |first=Patrick |date=November 11, 2018 |website=[[NME]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113025819/https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-set-of-westworld-has-been-destroyed-in-a-major-fire-2400886 |archive-date=November 13, 2018 |access-date=November 12, 2018}}</ref>\n{{wide image|Paramount_Ranch_-_Post-Woolsey_Fire.jpeg|600px|The Paramount Ranch following the Woolsey Fire and undergoing rebuilding in May 2019.

He was interested in their decision to approach the series' point of view from that of the hosts, deeming the result an inherent [[Psychology|psychological study]]. Upon its inception, the sequence would translate elements present in the series via [[computer-aided design]]. For example, once Clair was sent footage by composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] of a [[player piano]] in motion, its actual counterpart, situated in the ''Westworld'' production office, was photographed and then reconstructed in [[computer-generated imagery]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /><ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> Nolan also applied the self-playing instrument in reference to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s first novel ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]''. It was meant to represent the first [[Rube Goldberg machine]] to evoke human motion.<ref name=\"paranoid black paint\" /> Clair saw the metaphor behind the player piano&mdash;\"a primitive form of robot\"&mdash;as an exploration into the disparity between man and machine \"being created to be made redundant.\" Hosts that were bathed in white liquid struck Clair as a juxtaposition of the grit and grain of the Western genre with its basis in science fiction. Motifs of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[Vitruvian Man]] came about from Clair's wish to convey ''Westworld''{{'}}s depiction of the naked human body.<ref name=\"simulacrum\" /> The sequence also refers to [[Chris Cunningham]]'s 1999 music video for the [[Bj\u00f6rk]] song \"[[All Is Full of Love]]\", in a way that Clair called \"a bit shameless&nbsp;... because I worship Chris Cunningham and ... it seemed like the perfect place to do it because it was dealing with all the right themes and all the right aesthetics.\"<ref name=\"conceptualize\" />\n\nThe sequence commences with the rib cage of a horse, along with a set of hosts manufactured by [[industrial robot]]s. The skeletal horse is shown in mid-gallop to subvert the iconography of such a depiction.<ref name=\"conceptualize\" /> As for Clair's efforts in exposing the Western landscapes in connection with a world of [[robotics]], he thought it sensible that it be done inside a single eye; craters and valleys are formed as the simulacrum of an [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]].<ref name=\"simulacrum\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |title=The Secrets Behind Westworld's Opening Title Sequence |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |date=October 5, 2016 |website=[[Vulture.com]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008152317/http://www.vulture.com/2016/10/westworld-title-sequence-secrets.html |archive-date=October 8, 2016 |access-date=October 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second season introduces a new title sequence.
