As demands grew on the primitive firefighting units they began to coordinate and co-operate with each other until, on 1 January 1833, the London Fire Engine Establishment was formed under the leadership of [[James Braidwood (firefighter)|James Braidwood]], who had founded the first professional, municipal fire brigade in [[Edinburgh]].<ref name=LFBHist>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp London Fire Brigade: Key dates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618055617/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_history/key_dates.asp |date=18 June 2008 }}</ref> He introduced a uniform that, for the first time, included personal protection from the hazards of firefighting.

The risk category determines the minimum number of appliances to be sent in a pre-determined mobilisation.\n\nCategory \"A\" includes areas with a high density of large buildings and/or population, such as offices or factories. Three fire engines are to arrive at \"A\" risks within eight minutes, the first two within five minutes.\n\nAreas with a medium density of large buildings and/or population, such as multi-storey residential blocks, will generally be classified \"B\" risk. Two fire engines will be deployed, with one to arrive within five minutes and the second within eight minutes.\n\nCategory \"C\" covers lower density, suburban areas and detached properties. One fire engine should arrive at a \"C\" risk incident within ten minutes. More rural areas not covered by the first three categories will be considered \"D\" risk. One fire engine should arrive at \"D\" risks within 20 minutes.\n\n=== Response times ===\n[[File:LFB dampening down after blaze.jpg|thumb|right|Damping down using an aerial ladder platform after a fire in Camden]]\nIn 2007/08, the first fire engine mobilised to a 999 call arrived within five minutes 58.8% of the time, and within eight minutes 90% of the time. The second fire engine deployed arrived within eight minutes 81.9% of the time, and within ten minutes 92.4% of the time.\n\nIn 2010/11, the average response time of the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 34 seconds (6 minute target), and the second appliance was 6 minutes 53 seconds (8 minute target).<ref name=\"2010/11rpt\" />\n\nIn 2015/16, the average response time for the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 33 seconds (6 minute target), and the second appliance to the scene was 6 minutes 55 seconds (8 minute target).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==== Mutual assistance ====\nThe Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gives the UK fire services the ability to call upon other services or fire authorities in what is known as mutual assistance.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/40021--c.htm#13 Fire and Rescue Act 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190108/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/40021--c.htm#13 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> For example, the LFB played a comprehensive role in assisting [[Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service]] at the [[Buncefield fire]] in 2005.

For example, two appliances are despatched to a \"B\" risk area in response to a fire call in a residential house.  The officer-in-charge can request additional appliances by transmitting a radio message such as, \"make pumps 4\", or if persons are believed to be involved or trapped, \"make pumps 4, persons reported\".<ref>[http://www.shropshirefire.gov.uk/Docs/BrigadeOrders/Operations/Operations%20No%203%20Part%202%20-%20Incident%20Command%20Radio%20Messages%20-%20Main%20Radio%20Scheme.pdf Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, Operational Note 3 (in the public domain, accessed 22 May 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630153210/http://www.shropshirefire.gov.uk/Docs/BrigadeOrders/Operations/Operations%20No%203%20Part%202%20-%20Incident%20Command%20Radio%20Messages%20-%20Main%20Radio%20Scheme.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}</ref> The control room will then deploy a further two appliances making a total of four.

For example, the Cutty Sark fire was described as \"an 8-pump fire attended by 40 firefighters\".<ref name=\"press\" />\n\n=== Special services ===\nCore services are paid for by London's [[Council Tax|council tax]] payers and through central government funding known as a grant settlement; each council tax payer's bill will include a precept \u2013 a specific part of their bill that contributes to the funding of the fire brigade. Those in need of the LFB's services in an emergency do not pay, but the brigade can provide additional special services for which it may charge where there is no immediate threat to life or imminent risk of injury.\n\nExamples of these special services which may be charged for include the clearing of flooded commercial premises, the use of brigade equipment for supplying or removing water, and making structures safe in cases where there is no risk of personal injury to the public.\n\n=== Safety and fire prevention ===\nLFB firefighters and watch officers often visit residential and commercial premises to advise on hazard risk assessment and fire prevention. They also provide safety education to schools and youth groups.  Each of the London boroughs has a central fire safety office that collates and coordinates fire prevention work in accordance with legislation, and they are supported by a dedicated team of specialist officers.\n\nIn 2010/11, the LFB made 70,016 home fire safety visits. Over 100,000 children are seen each year by the brigade's schools team. Around half of all serious fires occur in the home, and many house fires attended by the LFB no smoke alarm was fitted, despite the LFB fitting tens of thousands in homes every year.\n\n== Stations and equipment ==\n[[File:LFBstn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dowgate]] fire station in the [[City of London]] is home to the [[fire investigation]] team]]\n[[File:Romford fire station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Romford]] fire station]]\nAs of 2014, the LFB has 103 fire stations, including one river station, across the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London]].<ref>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_organisation.asp London Fire Brigade: Our Organisation (accessed 16 Jan 07)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208103552/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_organisation.asp |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref> They are staffed 24 hours a day by full-time employees of the brigade, and are linked to a control centre in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/0DA45C1B1DC14505A4FA14A3D18EFBA0_PR2939.asp#.VZvvdBtVhBc|title=London Fire Brigade|date=1 February 2012|work=london-fire.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708032706/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/0DA45C1B1DC14505A4FA14A3D18EFBA0_PR2939.asp#.VZvvdBtVhBc|archivedate=8 July 2015}}</ref> This centre was opened in 2012; calls to it are fed from 999 operators at [[BT Group|BT]], [[Cable & Wireless Worldwide|Cable & Wireless]] and [[Global Crossing]].\n\nCentral London stations can attend up to 8,000 calls per year, inner-city stations about 3,000 to 4,000 calls per year (these tend to be the stations that are busy serving the densely populated areas), and outlying or suburban fire stations may attend around 1,500 calls which include road traffic accidents, grass fires and house fires.<ref>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/az/az_stations.asp London Fire Brigade: A-Z of fire stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212090045/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/az/az_stations.asp |date=12 December 2004 }}</ref>\n\nSome UK fire authorities use retained (part-time) firefighters who live and work near their local station and are on-call, but the LFB is one of only three UK fire services where all operational staff are full-time employees.\n\nEach station has four shifts, or 'watches': red, white, blue and green, with a Watch Manager in charge of each. The overall management of the station falls to the Station Manager, who will also attend serious incidents, as well as spending time on call.\n\nA group of one (City of London) to five (Tower Hamlets) stations within a borough are managed by a Borough Commander (Group Commander) who interacts strategically on a local level with the Borough Commander for the police and ambulance services and the chief executive of the local authority.\n\n=== Stations and districts ===\n* [http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/A-ZFireStations.asp Alphabetical fire station listing and addresses from the London Fire Brigade website]\n* [http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/150/map-of-london-fire-stations.asp Interactive map of current (status: 2016) and former London Fire Brigade fire stations]\n\nUpon the founding of the London County Council in 1965, the new authority was organised into 11 divisions, of roughly 10 to 12 stations each, designated 'A' Division through to 'L' Division, dispatched by three 999 mobilising control rooms. 'A' (West End), 'D' (West London), 'G' (North West London) and 'J' (North London) mobilised from Wembley (the former Middlesex headquarters); 'B' (Central London south of the river), 'E' (South East London and Kent), 'H' (South London and Surrey) and 'K' (South West London south of the river and Surrey) mobilised from Croydon (the former Croydon County Borough headquarters); finally, 'C' (City and Inner East London), 'F' (East London including Docklands) and 'L' (North East London and South West Essex), mobilised from Stratford (the former West Ham County Borough headquarters). Each of these divisions were, to a degree, autonomous of each other and had their own divisional management hierarchy. This arrangement lasted until 1989 when the brigade was re-organised into the current arrangement.\n\nThe LFB is currently formed into five divisions: Northern, Eastern, Western, Southeastern and Southwestern. As of 2013, 21 fire stations were located in the Northern Division and have [[call sign]]s prefixed \"A\"; 26 were in the Eastern Division with call signs prefixed \"F\"; Western Division consisted of 21 stations with \"G\"-prefixed call signs; 22 were under the Southeastern Division with an \"E\" prefix; and the remaining 22 were based in the Southwestern Division, call signs prefixed \"H\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://londonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/02/firemans-own-book-containing-accounts.html|title=LONDON FIRE JOURNAL|author=LONDON FIRE JOURNAL|work=londonfirejournal.blogspot.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160820/http://londonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/02/firemans-own-book-containing-accounts.html|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> As part of this organisation, many stations were re-coded.\n\nBelow is a complete listing, as of 2014, of the 102 fire stations of the London Fire Brigade according to district and station radio callsign.

The Northern District serves the following boroughs of London: [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], the [[City of Westminster]] and the [[City of London]].\n\n;Southeastern District\nThe Southeastern District Command is designated as \"E\" or \"Echo\". There are currently 19 fire stations in the Southeastern District. The Southeastern District serves the following boroughs of London: [[Bexley (London Borough)|Bexley]], [[Bromley (London Borough)|Bromley]], [[Greenwich (London Borough)|Greenwich]], [[Lewisham (London Borough)|Lewisham]], and [[Southwark (London Borough)|Southwark]].\n\n;Eastern District\nThe Eastern District Command is designated as \"F\" or \"Foxtrot\".

Around 55 stations are also assigned one additional pump. Numerous other stations are home to a range of other specialist vehicles.\n\nThe stations that are assigned both a dual pump ladder and a pump are generally the busier stations receiving over 2,000 emergency calls (known colloquially by firefighters as \"shouts\") per year. They may also be stations of strategic importance, or those located in areas considered to be high risk. The remaining stations equipped with a single pump ladder generally attend fewer than 2,000 calls per year.\n\nAn earlier fleet of mostly [[Volvo]] vehicles was phased out, with some retained for training and reserve purposes, and replaced between 2002 and 2011 with new [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, the LFB purchased five [[Mini Countryman]]s for conversion into instant response vehicles. The two-seat cars are fitted with six extinguishers (two each of water, foam and powder), plus a first-aid kit and defibrillator, and may be deployed to investigate automatic alarms actuating and smaller fires such as those in rubbish bins which do not require a full-sized engine and crew. The brigade has indicated a wish to add more smaller vehicles to its fleet, including [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover utility vehicles]] which could be fitted with water pumps, breathing apparatus and pull-out equipment drawers, and with enough space for four firefighters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/ingear/cars/article1218397.ece|title=Little squirts to the rescue&nbsp;\u2013 The Sunday Times|work=thesundaytimes.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221083538/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/ingear/cars/article1218397.ece|archivedate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the LFB announced they would be replacing the older-generation (currently used) [[Mercedes-Benz Atego]] pump appliances with brand new Mercedes-Benz Ategos which include new features such as: an improved 'crew cab' for the comfort and safety of firefighters, new high-pressure hoses which can deliver twice as much water as previous models, a brand new electronically-controlled pump, and a more economical and environment-friendly EURO VI engine, which will be compatible with London's low-emission zones. In 2017, 52 initial appliance orders are being rolled out across London ready for operational use, replacing the older 2002-2004 pumps, and later replacing the newer 2006-2008 pumps.

The risk category determines the minimum number of appliances to be sent in a pre-determined mobilisation.\n\nCategory \"A\" includes areas with a high density of large buildings and/or population, such as offices or factories. Three fire engines are to arrive at \"A\" risks within eight minutes, the first two within five minutes.\n\nAreas with a medium density of large buildings and/or population, such as multi-storey residential blocks, will generally be classified \"B\" risk. Two fire engines will be deployed, with one to arrive within five minutes and the second within eight minutes.\n\nCategory \"C\" covers lower density, suburban areas and detached properties. One fire engine should arrive at a \"C\" risk incident within ten minutes. More rural areas not covered by the first three categories will be considered \"D\" risk. One fire engine should arrive at \"D\" risks within 20 minutes.\n\n=== Response times ===\n[[File:LFB dampening down after blaze.jpg|thumb|right|Damping down using an aerial ladder platform after a fire in Camden]]\nIn 2007/08, the first fire engine mobilised to a 999 call arrived within five minutes 58.8% of the time, and within eight minutes 90% of the time. The second fire engine deployed arrived within eight minutes 81.9% of the time, and within ten minutes 92.4% of the time.\n\nIn 2010/11, the average response time of the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 34 seconds (6 minute target), and the second appliance was 6 minutes 53 seconds (8 minute target).<ref name=\"2010/11rpt\" />\n\nIn 2015/16, the average response time for the first appliance to the scene was 5 minutes 33 seconds (6 minute target), and the second appliance to the scene was 6 minutes 55 seconds (8 minute target).<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n==== Mutual assistance ====\nThe Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gives the UK fire services the ability to call upon other services or fire authorities in what is known as mutual assistance.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/40021--c.htm#13 Fire and Rescue Act 2004] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930190108/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/40021--c.htm#13 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> For example, the LFB played a comprehensive role in assisting [[Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service]] at the [[Buncefield fire]] in 2005.

For example, two appliances are despatched to a \"B\" risk area in response to a fire call in a residential house.  The officer-in-charge can request additional appliances by transmitting a radio message such as, \"make pumps 4\", or if persons are believed to be involved or trapped, \"make pumps 4, persons reported\".<ref>[http://www.shropshirefire.gov.uk/Docs/BrigadeOrders/Operations/Operations%20No%203%20Part%202%20-%20Incident%20Command%20Radio%20Messages%20-%20Main%20Radio%20Scheme.pdf Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service, Operational Note 3 (in the public domain, accessed 22 May 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630153210/http://www.shropshirefire.gov.uk/Docs/BrigadeOrders/Operations/Operations%20No%203%20Part%202%20-%20Incident%20Command%20Radio%20Messages%20-%20Main%20Radio%20Scheme.pdf |date=30 June 2007 }}</ref> The control room will then deploy a further two appliances making a total of four.

For example, the Cutty Sark fire was described as \"an 8-pump fire attended by 40 firefighters\".<ref name=\"press\" />\n\n=== Special services ===\nCore services are paid for by London's [[Council Tax|council tax]] payers and through central government funding known as a grant settlement; each council tax payer's bill will include a precept \u2013 a specific part of their bill that contributes to the funding of the fire brigade. Those in need of the LFB's services in an emergency do not pay, but the brigade can provide additional special services for which it may charge where there is no immediate threat to life or imminent risk of injury.\n\nExamples of these special services which may be charged for include the clearing of flooded commercial premises, the use of brigade equipment for supplying or removing water, and making structures safe in cases where there is no risk of personal injury to the public.\n\n=== Safety and fire prevention ===\nLFB firefighters and watch officers often visit residential and commercial premises to advise on hazard risk assessment and fire prevention. They also provide safety education to schools and youth groups.  Each of the London boroughs has a central fire safety office that collates and coordinates fire prevention work in accordance with legislation, and they are supported by a dedicated team of specialist officers.\n\nIn 2010/11, the LFB made 70,016 home fire safety visits. Over 100,000 children are seen each year by the brigade's schools team. Around half of all serious fires occur in the home, and many house fires attended by the LFB no smoke alarm was fitted, despite the LFB fitting tens of thousands in homes every year.\n\n== Stations and equipment ==\n[[File:LFBstn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dowgate]] fire station in the [[City of London]] is home to the [[fire investigation]] team]]\n[[File:Romford fire station.JPG|thumb|right|[[Romford]] fire station]]\nAs of 2014, the LFB has 103 fire stations, including one river station, across the 32 [[London borough]]s and the [[City of London]].<ref>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_organisation.asp London Fire Brigade: Our Organisation (accessed 16 Jan 07)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208103552/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/about_us/our_organisation.asp |date=8 February 2007 }}</ref> They are staffed 24 hours a day by full-time employees of the brigade, and are linked to a control centre in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/0DA45C1B1DC14505A4FA14A3D18EFBA0_PR2939.asp#.VZvvdBtVhBc|title=London Fire Brigade|date=1 February 2012|work=london-fire.gov.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708032706/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/0DA45C1B1DC14505A4FA14A3D18EFBA0_PR2939.asp#.VZvvdBtVhBc|archivedate=8 July 2015}}</ref> This centre was opened in 2012; calls to it are fed from 999 operators at [[BT Group|BT]], [[Cable & Wireless Worldwide|Cable & Wireless]] and [[Global Crossing]].\n\nCentral London stations can attend up to 8,000 calls per year, inner-city stations about 3,000 to 4,000 calls per year (these tend to be the stations that are busy serving the densely populated areas), and outlying or suburban fire stations may attend around 1,500 calls which include road traffic accidents, grass fires and house fires.<ref>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/az/az_stations.asp London Fire Brigade: A-Z of fire stations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041212090045/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/az/az_stations.asp |date=12 December 2004 }}</ref>\n\nSome UK fire authorities use retained (part-time) firefighters who live and work near their local station and are on-call, but the LFB is one of only three UK fire services where all operational staff are full-time employees.\n\nEach station has four shifts, or 'watches': red, white, blue and green, with a Watch Manager in charge of each. The overall management of the station falls to the Station Manager, who will also attend serious incidents, as well as spending time on call.\n\nA group of one (City of London) to five (Tower Hamlets) stations within a borough are managed by a Borough Commander (Group Commander) who interacts strategically on a local level with the Borough Commander for the police and ambulance services and the chief executive of the local authority.\n\n=== Stations and districts ===\n* [http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/A-ZFireStations.asp Alphabetical fire station listing and addresses from the London Fire Brigade website]\n* [http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/150/map-of-london-fire-stations.asp Interactive map of current (status: 2016) and former London Fire Brigade fire stations]\n\nUpon the founding of the London County Council in 1965, the new authority was organised into 11 divisions, of roughly 10 to 12 stations each, designated 'A' Division through to 'L' Division, dispatched by three 999 mobilising control rooms. 'A' (West End), 'D' (West London), 'G' (North West London) and 'J' (North London) mobilised from Wembley (the former Middlesex headquarters); 'B' (Central London south of the river), 'E' (South East London and Kent), 'H' (South London and Surrey) and 'K' (South West London south of the river and Surrey) mobilised from Croydon (the former Croydon County Borough headquarters); finally, 'C' (City and Inner East London), 'F' (East London including Docklands) and 'L' (North East London and South West Essex), mobilised from Stratford (the former West Ham County Borough headquarters). Each of these divisions were, to a degree, autonomous of each other and had their own divisional management hierarchy. This arrangement lasted until 1989 when the brigade was re-organised into the current arrangement.\n\nThe LFB is currently formed into five divisions: Northern, Eastern, Western, Southeastern and Southwestern. As of 2013, 21 fire stations were located in the Northern Division and have [[call sign]]s prefixed \"A\"; 26 were in the Eastern Division with call signs prefixed \"F\"; Western Division consisted of 21 stations with \"G\"-prefixed call signs; 22 were under the Southeastern Division with an \"E\" prefix; and the remaining 22 were based in the Southwestern Division, call signs prefixed \"H\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://londonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/02/firemans-own-book-containing-accounts.html|title=LONDON FIRE JOURNAL|author=LONDON FIRE JOURNAL|work=londonfirejournal.blogspot.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724160820/http://londonfirejournal.blogspot.com/2008/02/firemans-own-book-containing-accounts.html|archivedate=24 July 2011}}</ref> As part of this organisation, many stations were re-coded.\n\nBelow is a complete listing, as of 2014, of the 102 fire stations of the London Fire Brigade according to district and station radio callsign. The LFB is divided into five districts, each designated by a letter of the alphabet: the Northern District Command is designated as \"A\"; the Southeastern District Command is designated as \"E\"; the Eastern District Command is designated as \"F\"; the Western District Command is designated as \"G\"; the Southwestern District Command is designated as \"H\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n;Northern District\nThe Northern District Command is designated as \"A\" or \"Alpha\". There are currently 17 fire stations in the Northern District. The Northern District serves the following boroughs of London: [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], the [[City of Westminster]] and the [[City of London]].\n\n;Southeastern District\nThe Southeastern District Command is designated as \"E\" or \"Echo\". There are currently 19 fire stations in the Southeastern District. The Southeastern District serves the following boroughs of London: [[Bexley (London Borough)|Bexley]], [[Bromley (London Borough)|Bromley]], [[Greenwich (London Borough)|Greenwich]], [[Lewisham (London Borough)|Lewisham]], and [[Southwark (London Borough)|Southwark]].\n\n;Eastern District\nThe Eastern District Command is designated as \"F\" or \"Foxtrot\". There are currently 23 fire stations in the Eastern District. The Eastern District serves the following boroughs of London: [[Barking and Dagenham]], [[Hackney (London Borough)|Hackney]]\n, [[Havering (London Borough)|Havering]], [[Newham (London Borough)|Newham]], [[Redbridge (London Borough)|Redbridge]], [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]], and [[Waltham Forest]].\n\n;Western District\nThe Western District Command is designated as \"G\" or \"Golf\". There are currently 21 fire stations in the Western District. The Western District serves the following boroughs of London: Brent, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow, and Kensington and Chelsea.\n\n;Southwestern District\nThe Southwestern District Command is designated as \"H\" or \"Hotel\". There are currently 22 fire stations in the Southwestern District, including the independent River Station, the quarters of the Fireboat.

Around 55 stations are also assigned one additional pump. Numerous other stations are home to a range of other specialist vehicles.\n\nThe stations that are assigned both a dual pump ladder and a pump are generally the busier stations receiving over 2,000 emergency calls (known colloquially by firefighters as \"shouts\") per year. They may also be stations of strategic importance, or those located in areas considered to be high risk. The remaining stations equipped with a single pump ladder generally attend fewer than 2,000 calls per year.\n\nAn earlier fleet of mostly [[Volvo]] vehicles was phased out, with some retained for training and reserve purposes, and replaced between 2002 and 2011 with new [[Mercedes-Benz]] vehicles.\n\nIn 2012, the LFB purchased five [[Mini Countryman]]s for conversion into instant response vehicles. The two-seat cars are fitted with six extinguishers (two each of water, foam and powder), plus a first-aid kit and defibrillator, and may be deployed to investigate automatic alarms actuating and smaller fires such as those in rubbish bins which do not require a full-sized engine and crew. The brigade has indicated a wish to add more smaller vehicles to its fleet, including [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover utility vehicles]] which could be fitted with water pumps, breathing apparatus and pull-out equipment drawers, and with enough space for four firefighters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/ingear/cars/article1218397.ece|title=Little squirts to the rescue&nbsp;\u2013 The Sunday Times|work=thesundaytimes.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221083538/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/ingear/cars/article1218397.ece|archivedate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, the LFB announced they would be replacing the older-generation (currently used) [[Mercedes-Benz Atego]] pump appliances with brand new Mercedes-Benz Ategos which include new features such as: an improved 'crew cab' for the comfort and safety of firefighters, new high-pressure hoses which can deliver twice as much water as previous models, a brand new electronically-controlled pump, and a more economical and environment-friendly EURO VI engine, which will be compatible with London's low-emission zones. In 2017, 52 initial appliance orders are being rolled out across London ready for operational use, replacing the older 2002-2004 pumps, and later replacing the newer 2006-2008 pumps. The primary reason for the replacement of the older Ategos was due to their age (some being 15 years old) and poor economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_New-Brigade-vehicle-prototype-gets-royal-approval.asp#.WH582H2DHIU|title=News|website=www.london-fire.gov.uk|accessdate=5 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101113950/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_New-Brigade-vehicle-prototype-gets-royal-approval.asp#.WH582H2DHIU|archivedate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2016, the LFB's frontline operational fleet consists of:\n* Approximately 100 Dual Pump Ladders (DPL) (plus approximately 25 used for training)\n* Approximately 50 Pumps (P)\n* 15 Fire Rescue Units (FRU) (plus 1 for training)\n* 14 [[Urban Search and Rescue]] (USAR) multi-purpose vehicles\n* 8 Incident Response Units (IRU)\n* 8 Command Support Units (CSU)\n* 7 Aerial Ladder Platforms (ALP)\n* 6 Operational Support Units (OSU)\n* 6 High-volume Pumps (HVP)\n* 6 Fire Investigation Units (FIU)\n* 5 Instant Response Vehicles (IRV)\n* 4 Turntable Ladders (TL)\n* 4 Hose Laying Units (HLU)\n* 3 Bulk Foam Units (BFU)\n* 2 Scientific Support Units (SSU)\n* 2 Detection, Identification, and Monitoring Units (DIM)\n* 1 All-terrain Pump\n* 1 Heavy Distribution Unit (HDU)\n* 1 Fire Investigation Dog Unit (FID)\n* 1 Fireboat (plus 1 used as a reserve and for training)\n\n=== Improvements ===\nThe programme of improvements in staffing and equipment undertaken by the LFB since the [[September 11 attacks]] to improve London's resilience and its capability to deal with major emergencies, including the threat of terrorism has included: ten Incident Response Units; two Scientific Support Units; four different types of [[urban search and rescue]] (USAR) vehicles and ten USAR personnel carriers; three mass decontamination resilience units; and six equipment carriers known as Operational Support Units.<ref>[http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/detail.asp?id=893 Better preparation for major emergencies and terrorist attacks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010025037/http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/detail.asp?id=893 |date=10 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nArchitecturally, fire stations vary in age and design from [[Edwardian era]] red-brick fire houses to modern spacious blocks complete with additional specialist facilities.<ref>[http://www.firefleet.co.uk/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=20 Firefleet.co.uk gallery of London fire stations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928030939/http://www.firefleet.co.uk/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=20 |date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> Early fire stations were originally built with horse-drawn appliances in mind and with traditional features such as the [[fireman's pole]], used by firefighters to gain rapid access from their upstairs quarters to the fire engine garages below when summoned.\n\nMore modern fire stations, though constructed without such features, often have more spacious accommodation and facilities for staff of both sexes, public visitor areas such as community safety offices and other amenities.

Valuable lessons were learnt after the Smithfield blaze, including introducing a tally system of firefighters' locations and quantity of breathing apparatus.\n:On the 50th anniversary of the Smithfield blaze, in 2008, the then Deputy Commissioner of the LFB said: \"This was a landmark fire in the history of London and its fire brigade.

A Personal Account'', published in 1979.<ref name=\"wallington\" /> He chronicled his transition from a firefighter in the Croydon Fire Brigade through to his reaching the rank of station officer in the LFB.  He went on to become the Chief Fire Officer of the Devon fire brigade (now known as [[Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service]]) and has written several books about fire services over the world.

Unlike in the UK, TV Licences may still be purchased at Post Offices on Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.]]\nThe payment methods mean that the licence fee is paid for either completely or partially in advance. Annual payments require complete payment in advance. For monthly direct debit, a new licence is paid off in 6 monthly installments of just over \u00a324 a month. Renewal licences are paid for in 12 monthly installments starting 6 months before expiry of the licence in force i.e. starting 6 months before the renewal date.<ref name=\"Payment methods\"/>   Quarterly payments made using direct debit carry an additional cost of \u00a35.00 per year, or \u00a31.25 a quarter, which is included in the licence fee total. This addition is described as \"a small charge\" in the generic letter issued by TV Licensing to those paying by direct debit, and on the TV Licensing website it is justified with: \"By paying quarterly the majority of your licence is paid for as you use it. This differs from our other instalment schemes, where at least half of the licence fee is collected in advance.

Monthly or weekly payments may also be made by holders of a TV Licensing payment card (see below)\n* TV Licensing payment card. Holders of this card will have a payment plan showing when and how much they need to pay. Payments may be made weekly or monthly at PayPoint outlets. Payments may also be made online, by phone or by text message (with credit or debit card).\n* TV Licensing savings card. This is a way for a licence fee holder to save for a subsequent licence. If enough money for the new licence is saved up, a new licence is sent automatically. Otherwise the balance has to be paid for.\n* [[Cheques|Cheque]] and [[postal order]]s.

Unlike in the UK, TV Licences may still be purchased at Post Offices on Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man.]]\nThe payment methods mean that the licence fee is paid for either completely or partially in advance. Annual payments require complete payment in advance. For monthly direct debit, a new licence is paid off in 6 monthly installments of just over \u00a324 a month. Renewal licences are paid for in 12 monthly installments starting 6 months before expiry of the licence in force i.e. starting 6 months before the renewal date.<ref name=\"Payment methods\"/>   Quarterly payments made using direct debit carry an additional cost of \u00a35.00 per year, or \u00a31.25 a quarter, which is included in the licence fee total. This addition is described as \"a small charge\" in the generic letter issued by TV Licensing to those paying by direct debit, and on the TV Licensing website it is justified with: \"By paying quarterly the majority of your licence is paid for as you use it. This differs from our other instalment schemes, where at least half of the licence fee is collected in advance. As a result, quarterly payments incur a small premium of \u00a31.25 per quarter which is included in your payment.\"<ref name=\"Payment methods\" /> Typically, direct debit schemes in the UK for major utilities or publicly provided services operate in a reverse way, granting a discount to direct debit payers.\n\nIn the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, over the counter services are provided by the Post Office rather than by PayPoint outlets.<ref name=\"PayPoint\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/payment-methods/paypoint-pay5|author=TV Licensing|title=PayPoint|accessdate=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602143223/https://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/pay-for-your-tv-licence/payment-methods/paypoint-pay5|archive-date=2 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Concessions===\n\n====Over 75s ====\nIn the United Kingdom, free TV licences are currently available to everyone aged over 75.

The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 100 meters. The anomaly could still be detected at almost 3000 feet. \nThe Aircraft was a Britten Norman Islander Registration VH-FLE. The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator that actually first recognized the significance of the anomaly.\n\n\nThe Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill [[formation (geology)|Formation]], consisting of Lower [[Proterozoic]] [[metasediment]]s, located in the [[Alligator Rivers]] Uranium Field.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoellner|first1=Tom|title=Uranium|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143116721|pages=180-181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=J.

Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special [[statutory authority]], the [[Supervising Scientist]], was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region.\n\nRanger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near [[Nourlangie Rock]] in Kakadu north-eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name 'Ranger' for the series of discoveries made by [[Geopeko Limited]], the exploration arm of the Australian mining company Peko-Wallsend Limited, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries are enclosed in the National Park, locking up an energy source that is estimated to be greater than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. (12)\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney on Wednesday 11 November 2009. During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp</ref>\n\n==Ranger 3 Deeps==\nERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource.  The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide.\n\nIn parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine.  This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted.  ERA will also consult further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/whatwedo/2324_ranger_3_deeps_exploration_decline.asp</ref>\n\nERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999 in January 2013. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act.\n\n== Ore processing ==\n\nOre is ground, then leached with [[sulfuric acid]]. Uranium is removed using [[kerosene]] with [[amine]] then stripped with [[ammonium sulfate]] solution and gaseous [[ammonia]].

It is surrounded by, but separate from [[Kakadu National Park]], 230&nbsp;km east of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. The orebody was discovered in late 1969, and the mine commenced operation in 1980, reaching full production of [[uranium oxide]] in 1981. It is operated by [[Energy Resources of Australia]], a 68% subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group]]. Uranium mined at Ranger is sold for use in [[nuclear power station]]s in Asia, Europe and North America.<ref name=\"UIC\"/>\n\nThe original orebody was completely mined out by the end of 1995, although some ore remains stockpiled. A second orebody (\"Ranger 3\") began mining in 1997. Both have been [[open-pit mining|open-pit]] mines. Open cut mining finished at Ranger in late 2012 and the mine is now processing stockpiled ore.<ref name=acf13/>\n\nAs of 2013, the ageing Ranger mine has been incurring financial losses as a result of the continuing market slump which has followed the 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]].

The instrument that detected the anomaly was a Nuclear Enterprises gamma ray spectrometer using a Thallium doped Sodium Iodide cylindrical crystal. At time of discovery the aircraft was flying at an altitude of 100 meters. The anomaly could still be detected at almost 3000 feet. \nThe Aircraft was a Britten Norman Islander Registration VH-FLE. The crew members on board were Bill Hay, the pilot, Harvey Morton, the navigator and Frank Lanza, the instruments operator that actually first recognized the significance of the anomaly.\n\n\nThe Ranger No. 1 and Ranger No. 3 ore bodies occur in the Cahill [[formation (geology)|Formation]], consisting of Lower [[Proterozoic]] [[metasediment]]s, located in the [[Alligator Rivers]] Uranium Field.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zoellner|first1=Tom|title=Uranium|date=2009|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=9780143116721|pages=180-181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Nash|first1=J.

Owing to the environmental sensitivity of the site, a special statutory authority, the [[Supervising Scientist]], was created to provide oversight of the operation and conduct environmental research in the region.\n\nRanger mine covers two of a line of uranium orebodies that extend from near [[Nourlangie Rock]] in Kakadu north-eastwards to Koongarra, underneath Mount Brockman, then northwards through the Ranger One line of orebodies (in order Number 2, Number 1, and Number 3), then via Hades Flat, where there is uranium mineralisation, to Jabiluka where the line turns westward through the Barote and Ranger 4 orebodies. The mine covers No 1 Orebody and No 3 Orebody. No 2 orebody was excluded from the mining lease at the request of the traditional owners and included in Kakadu National Park. From Ranger 4 the line again turns northwards and then swings westward round an Archaean basement dome before turning south towards Nourlangie Rock again. Uranium mineralisation is known at several other places along this line but has never been explored in detail because of the creation of Kakadu. The name 'Ranger' for the series of discoveries made by [[Geopeko Limited]], the exploration arm of the Australian mining company Peko-Wallsend Limited, in the period 1969 to 1972, was thought up by Judy Ryan, the wife of the geologist in charge of the program. Koongarra and Jabiluka were retained by the companies that found them: Noranda Australia and Pancontinental Mining respectively, although since sold to other parties. The other discoveries are enclosed in the National Park, locking up an energy source that is estimated to be greater than the oil reserves of Saudi Arabia. (12)\n\nEnergy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA) was named Explorer of the Year at the sixth annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards held in Sydney on Wednesday 11 November 2009. During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp</ref>\n\n==Ranger 3 Deeps==\nERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource.  The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide.\n\nIn parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine.  This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted.  ERA will also consult further with the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation as a component of a broader social impact assessment.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/whatwedo/2324_ranger_3_deeps_exploration_decline.asp</ref>\n\nERA formally commenced the statutory approval process for the proposed Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine with the submission of a referral to the Commonwealth Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water Population and Communities under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Control Act 1999 in January 2013. At the same time, ERA separately lodged a notice of intent with the Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority under the Northern Territory Environmental Assessment Act.\n\n== Ore processing ==\n\nOre is ground, then leached with [[sulfuric acid]]. Uranium is removed using [[kerosene]] with [[amine]] then stripped with [[ammonium sulfate]] solution and gaseous [[ammonia]]. [[Ammonium diuranate]] is precipitated by increased [[pH]] and converted to uranium oxide (U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) in a furnace.<ref name=\"UIC\">{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf48.html |work=Australia's Uranium Mines |title=Ranger |publisher=World Nuclear Association |accessdate=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, ERA announced an expansion to the ore processing plant which will allow production to extend into lower-grade material and in November 2006 the company announced plans to invest in a [[laterite]] processing plant, which will allow it to process ore with a high clay content that has been stockpiled since the mine began operating. This ore had been already included in stated reserves.
