{"title_page": "Swahili grammar", "text_new": "{{cleanup lang|date=May 2019}}\n{{short description|Grammar}}\n'''[[Swahili language|Swahili]] [swa] (ISO 639-2) [[grammar]]''' is typical for [[Bantu languages]], bearing all the hallmarks of this language family. These include [[agglutinative language|agglutinativity]], a rich array of [[noun class]]es, extensive inflection for person (both subject and object), [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|tense, aspect and mood]], and generally a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] word order.\n\n== Typology ==\nSwahili may be described in several ways depending on the aspect being considered.\n* It is an [[agglutinative language]]. It constructs whole words by joining together discrete roots and [[morphemes]] with specific meanings, and may also modify words by similar processes.\n* Its basic word order is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]. However, because the verb is inflected to indicate the subject and sometimes also the object, this order may be changed to emphasise certain parts of the sentence.\n* It has no [[grammatical case]] marking on the noun. Nominal roles are indicated by a combination of word order and agreement markers on the verb, with no change to the nouns themselves.\n* It has a complex [[grammatical gender]] system, but as this does not include a distinction based on natural sex, the term \"noun class\" is generally used instead of \"gender\".\n* It has [[head-first]] order with few exceptions.\n* It is a [[pro-drop language]]. Verbs may be used without explicitly specifying the subject or the object with substantives (nouns or pronouns).\n\n==Nouns==\n===Noun classes===\nSwahili [[noun]]s are grouped into '''[[noun class]]es''' based on the [[prefix]] they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns ''[[wikt:msichana#Swahili|wasichana]]'' \"girls\" and ''[[wikt:msimamizi#Swahili|wasimamizi]]'' \"overseers\" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix ''wa-'', whereas ''[[wikt:kifuniko#Swahili|kifuniko]]'' \"lid, cover\" and ''[[wikt:kisukari#Swahili|kisukari]]'' \"diabetes\" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix ''ki-''. The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] for [[Proto-Bantu]], and have corresponding classes in the other [[Bantu languages]] which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12 and 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties).\n\nWhen discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) ''morphological'' noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) ''syntactic'' noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, \"noun class\" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by ''m-wa.'' For more information, see [[Swahili grammar#Concord|concord]].\n\nThe following noun classes exist:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Prefix before consonant\n! Prefix before vowel\n! Example\n|-\n! 1\n| m-<sup>1</sup>\n| mw-<sup>1</sup>\n| [[wikt:mtu#Swahili|''mtu'']] \"person\"\n|-\n! 2\n| wa-\n| w(a)-<sup>2</sup>\n| [[wikt:watu#Swahili|''watu'']] \"people\"\n|-\n! 3\n| m-<sup>1</sup>\n| mw-<sup>1</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:mti#Swahili|mti]]'' \"tree\"\n|-\n! 4\n| mi-\n| mi-\n| ''[[wikt:miti#Swahili|miti]]'' \"trees\"\n|-\n! 5\n| (ji-)<sup>3</sup>\n| (j-)<sup>3</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:jicho#Swahili|jicho]]'' \"eye\"\n|-\n! 6\n| ma-\n| ma-<sup>4</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:macho#Swahili|macho]]'' \"eyes\"\n|-\n! 7\n| ki-\n| ch-/ki-<sup>5</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:kitabu#Swahili|kitabu]]'' \"book\"\n|-\n! 8\n| vi-\n| vy-/vi-<sup>5</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:vitabu#Swahili|vitabu]]'' \"books\"\n|-\n! 9\n| n-<sup>6</sup>\n| ny-\n| ''[[wikt:simba#Swahili|simba]]'' \"lion\"\n|-\n! 10\n| n-<sup>6</sup>\n| ny-\n| ''[[wikt:simba#Swahili|simba]]'' \"lions\", ''[[wikt:funguo#Swahili|funguo]]'' \"keys\"\n|-\n! 11\n| u-\n| u-/uw-/w-<sup>7</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:ufunguo#Swahili|ufunguo]]'' \"key\"\n|-\n! 14\n| u-\n| u-/uw-/w-<sup>7</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:utu#Swahili|utu]]'' \"humanity\"\n|-\n! 15\n| ku-\n| ku-/kw-<sup>8</sup>\n| ''[[wikt:la#Swahili|kula]]'' \"eating, consuming\"\n|-\n! 16\n| rowspan=\"3\" | -<sup>9</sup>\n| rowspan=\"3\" | -<sup>9</sup>\n| rowspan=\"3\" | ''[[wikt:mahali#Swahili|mahali]]'' \"place\"\n|-\n!17\n|-\n!18\n|}\n\n# This ''m-'' before a consonant is always syllabic /m\u0329/, even when the following consonant is ''b'' or ''v'', as in ''mvulana'' \"boy\" [m\u0329.vu.\u02c8l\u0251(\u02d0).n\u0251]. The ''mw-'' before a vowel, however, is not syllabic, as in ''mwalimu'' \"teacher\" [mw\u0251.\u02c8li(\u02d0).mu]. When the stem is only one syllable, the prefix takes the stress, as in ''mtu'' \"person\" [\u02c8m\u0329.tu]. Before a stem beginning with ''u'', the prefix may appear as either ''mw-'' or ''mu-'', as in ''mwuguzi'' / ''muuguzi'' \"nurse\". A few nouns, mostly loans, have ''mu-'' before a consonant, such as ''muziki'' \"music\", ''musuli'' \"muscle\" and ''muda'' \"length of time\" (although ''mziki'', ''msuli'' and ''mda'' are also widespread variations). In class 3, the ''w'' is frequently absent before ''o'' as in ''moyo'' \"heart\" (plural: ''mioyo''), ''moto'' \"fire\" (plural: ''mioto'') and ''moshi'' \"smoke\".\n# ''Wa-'' is often present only as ''w-'' when the stem begins with /a/ as in ''[[wikt:wanafunzi#Swahili|'''w'''anafunzi]]'' \"students\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwanafunzi#Swahili|'''mw'''anafunzi]]''). A following ''i'' may merge with the ''a'' of this prefix, forming ''we-'' as in ''[[wikt:wezi#Swahili|'''we'''zi]]'' \"thieves\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwizi#Swahili|'''mw'''izi]]''). The ''a'' in this prefix is generally preserved in nouns which are derived from verbs, such as ''[[wikt:waandishi#Swahili|'''wa'''andishi]]'' \"writer\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwandishi#Swahili|'''mw'''andishi]]'', from the verb ''[[wikt:andika#Swahili|-andika]]'' \"to write\"), as well as those derived from proper nouns, such as ''[[wikt:Waafrika#Swahili|'''Wa'''afrika]]'' \"Africans\" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwafrika#Swahili|'''Mw'''afrika]]'') and ''[[wikt:Waislamu#Swahili|'''Wa'''islamu]]'' \"Muslims\" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwislamu#Swahili|'''Mw'''islamu]]'')\n# The ''ji-'' prefix occurs on nouns with monosyllabic stems, such as ''[[wikt:jiwe#Swahili|'''ji'''we]]'' \"stone\" (plural: ''[[wikt:mawe#Swahili|'''ma'''we]]''), but is absent from longer words. This is not to be confused with the augmentative prefix ''ji-'', which is not dropped in the plural, for example ''[[wikt:jiji#Swahili|jiji]]'' \"large town, city\" (plural: ''[[wikt:majiji#Swahili|'''ma'''jiji]]'', from ''[[wikt:mji#Swahili|'''m'''ji]]'' \"town\"). Some nouns may also simply have stems which start with ''ji-'' such as ''[[wiktionary:jina#Swahili|jina]]'' \"name\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:majina#Swahili|'''ma'''jina]]''). Some words whose stems begin with a vowel take the prefix ''j-'', such as ''[[wiktionary:jambo#Swahili|jambo]]'' \"thing, affair\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:mambo#Swahili|'''m'''ambo]]'') but others do not, such as ''[[wiktionary:azimio#Swahili|azimio]]'' \"resolution\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:maazimio#Swahili|'''ma'''azimio]]'').\n# The prefix ''ma-'' may merge with a following ''i'' to become ''me-'' as in ''[[wikt:meno#Swahili|'''me'''no]]'' \"teeth\" (singular: ''[[wikt:jino#Swahili|'''j'''ino]]'').\n# The prefixes ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' may sometimes appear before vowels, such as in ''[[wikt:kiazi#Swahili|'''ki'''azi]]'' \"potato\" (plural: ''[[wikt:viazi#Swahili|'''vi'''azi]]'') rather than the possibly expected *''chazi'' and *''vyazi''. It is possible to regard the stem of these words as beginning with the ''i'' (e.g. ''-iazi'') as adjectives beginning with ''i'' simply take ''k-'' and ''v-'' prefixes in these classes.\n# The ''n'' of the prefix is a prenasalising [[Consonant mutation|mutation]] of the following consonant and is never syllabic unless the noun would otherwise only have one syllable. It becomes ''m'' before ''b'' and ''v''. In stems beginning with ''w'' such as ''[[wikt:mbili#Swahili|-wili]]'' \"two\", this mutates to ''mb''. Before vowels it is present as ''ny''. Before ''d'', ''z'', ''j'' and ''g'' it is ''n''. ''L'' and ''r'' become ''nd''. Before other consonants, it disappears unless it needs to be syllabic to prevent the noun from having only one syllable, such as in ''[[wikt:nchi#Swahili|'''n'''chi]]'' \"country, land\". The plural form of class 11 nouns is formed this way, dropping the ''u-'' and then applying these rules (for example ''ulimi'' \u2192 ''ndimi'' \"tongue\" \u2192 \"tongues\", ''ukuta'' \u2192 ''kuta'' \"wall\" \u2192 \"walls\"), except that short nouns with a monosyllabic stem preserve the ''u-'' in the plural for reasons of stress, adding ''ny-'' before it to form the plural, such as ''[[wikt:uso#Swahili|'''u'''so]]'' \"face\", which becomes ''[[wikt:nyuso#Swahili|'''ny'''uso]]'' in the plural.\n# The ''u-'' prefix has some variation in spelling and pronunciation before vowels.\n# The ''ku-'' prefix becomes ''kw-'' only before a minority of stems: ''[[wikt:enda#Swahili|'''kw'''enda]]'' \"to go\" and ''[[wikt:isha#Swahili|'''kw'''isha]]'' \"to finish\".\n# The locative classes of nouns no longer have their original ''pa-'', ''ku-'', ''m(u)-''prefixes in Swahili, with these only appearing on adjectives, demonstratives and other parts of the grammar. Most nouns form their locative form by adding the suffix ''-ni'' although this cannot be added to geographical place names, many recent loans and certain other words.\n\nEvery class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 ''mtu'' \"person\" is class 2 ''watu'' \"people\". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example ''ugonjwa'' \"sickness, disease\", ''magonjwa'' \"diseases\". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as ''maji'' \"water\", and other nouns derived from verbs such as ''mazungumzo'' \"conversation(s)\". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as ''mchana'' \"afternoon(s)\", \"daytime\" (class 3), ''vita'' \"war(s)\" (class 8), ''usiku'' \"night(s)\" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.\n\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including [[agent noun]]s, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. [[Abstract noun]]s are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.\n\n=== Concord ===\nThe class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement or concord]]. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed \"concords\" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 1/2:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Mwanaume mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Wanaume wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''mw'''anaume\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''w'''anaume\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL1)'''man\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL2)'''men\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"man\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"men\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big man fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big men fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 7/8:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Kitabu kikubwa kilianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Vitabu vikubwa vilianguka.''\n|-\n|'''ki'''tabu\n|'''ki'''-kubwa\n|'''ki'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''vi'''tabu\n|'''vi'''-kubwa\n|'''vi'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL7)'''book\n|'''CL7'''-big\n|'''CL7'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL8)'''books\n|'''CL8'''-big\n|'''CL8'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"book\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"books\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big book fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big books fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 11/10:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Uso mzuri unatosha.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Nyuso nzuri zinatosha.''\n|-\n|'''u'''so\n|'''m'''-zuri\n|'''u'''-na-tosh(a)\n|'''ny'''uso\n|'''n'''-zuri\n|'''zi'''-na-tosh(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL11)'''face\n|'''CL11'''-beautiful\n|'''CL11'''-PRES-be.enough\n|'''(CL10)'''faces\n|'''CL10'''-beautiful\n|'''CL10'''-PRES-be.enough\n|-\n|<small>\"face\"</small>\n|<small>\"beautiful\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-is-enough\"</small>\n|<small>\"faces\"</small>\n|<small>\"beautiful\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-are-enough\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"A beautiful face is enough.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Beautiful faces are enough.\"\n|}\n\n[[animacy|Animate nouns]] (i.e. those referring to people or animals) which are not in classes 1/2 generally take the agreement prefixes (concords) from classes 1/2 as if they did belong to it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 7/8 Animate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Kifaru mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Vifaru wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''ki'''faru\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''vi'''faru\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL7)'''rhinoceros\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL8)'''rhinoceroses\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"rhinoceros\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"rhinoceroses\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big rhinoceros fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big rhinoceroses fell.\"\n|}\n\nAnimacy agreements can often distinguish different meanings of the same noun, such as ''ndege'', which means \"bird(s)\" when animate and \"aeroplane(s)\" when inanimate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 9/10 Animate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL9)'''bird\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL10)'''birds\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"bird\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"birds\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big bird fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big birds fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 9/10 Inanimate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege kubwa ilianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege kubwa zilianguka.''\n|-\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''N'''-kubwa\n|'''i'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''N'''-kubwa\n|'''zi'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL9)'''bird\n|'''CL9'''-big\n|'''CL9'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL10)'''birds\n|'''CL10'''-big\n|'''CL10'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"bird\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"birds\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big plane fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big planes fell.\"\n|}\n\nAnimate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight aberration from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms ''-angu'', ''-ako'', ''-ake'', ''-etu'', ''-enu'' and ''-ao'' are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving ''yangu'', ''yako'', ''yetu'' etc. in singular and ''zangu'', ''zako'', ''zetu'' etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition ''-a'' (giving ''ya'' in singular and ''za'' in plural), however for most speakers ''wa'' is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"9\" |Class 9/10 Animate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |''Mama yetu mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n!

The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.\n\nThe Arabic loan noun ''mahali'' \"place\" (and its variations: ''pahali'', ''mahala'' and ''pahala'') is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix ''-ni'' to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.\n\nBecause locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on ''pa-'' and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on ''ku-'' indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on ''mu-'' and indicates internal location.\n\n* ''nyumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''y'''a]] Rehema'' \"Rehema's house\" (class 9)\n* ''nyumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''kw'''a]] Rehema'' \"at/to/from Rehema's house\" (class 17)\n* ''chumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''ch'''a]] Daudi'' \"Daudi's room\" (class 7)\n* ''chumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''mw'''a]] Daudi'' \"in/into/out of Daudi's room\" (class 18)\n\n=== Apposition and compounding ===\nThe equivalent of compound words is usually formed using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive construction]] such as ''mpira '''wa''' kikapu'' \"basketball\" (literally \"''ball '''of''' basket''\"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French ''fin '''de''' semaine'' \"weekend\" (literally \"''end '''of''' week''\").\n\nThere are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition ''-a''. In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side.\n\nThe word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes ''what'' it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun ''punda'' \"donkey(s)\" is followed by the class 4 noun ''milia'' \"stripes\" to mean \"zebra\". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: \"stripe-donkey\", the word for \"donkey\" appears first in Swahili.\n\nThere is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for \"zebra(s)\" may appear as any of ''pundamilia'', ''punda-milia'' or ''punda milia''.\n\nA few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ke'' \"woman\" becomes '''''w'''ana'''wa'''ke'' \"women\" in plural. Similarly, '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ume'' \"man\" becomes '''''w'''anaume'' \"men\" in plural, although the singular form '''''mw'''anaume'' is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word ''mwana'' \"son, daughter\", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean \"person\", followed by the words ''mke'' \"wife\" (plural: ''wake'') and ''mume'' \"husband\" (plural: ''waume'') respectively.\n\n==Pronouns==\n\nPronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between ''we'' and ''us'', which are both ''sisi''.\n\n===Personal pronouns===\n\nPersonal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as ''na'' \"with, and\" and ''ndi-'' \"it is\". The independent form consists, in all cases except for ''wao'', of a reduplication of a syllable. ''Nyinyi'', however, may alternatively be dissimilated to ''ninyi''.  These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Independent\n! Combining\nsuffix\n! Genitive<br/>suffix\n!\"all\"\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n| ''mimi''\n| ''-mi''\n| ''-angu''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n| ''wewe''\n| ''-we''\n| ''-ako''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 3rd sing.\n| ''yeye''\n| ''-ye''\n| ''-ake''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n| ''sisi''\n| ''-si''\n| ''-etu''\n|''(sisi) sote''\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n| ''nyinyi, ninyi''\n| ''-nyi''\n| ''-enu''\n|''(nyinyi) nyote''\n|-\n! 3rd plur.\n| ''wao''\n| ''-o''\n| ''-ao''\n|''(wao) wote''\n|}\n\nNote that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with ''yeye'' capable of meaning either \"he\" or \"she\". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean ''it''. The genitive form ''-ake'' has no such restriction and may mean \"his\", \"hers\" or \"its\" depending on context.\n\nSwahili is a [[pro-drop]] language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula ''ni'' (or its negative counterpart ''si'') is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.\n\nIn informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as ''mi'' or ''mie'' for ''mimi''. This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. ''mi ni'' \"I am\", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix ''ni-'' is dropped in casual speech before ''-na-''. For example, standard ''(mimi) ninajua'' \"I know\" often occurs as (''mi) najua'' in spoken Swahili.\n\n== Determiners ==\n[[Determiner]]s in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs.\n\n===Articles===\nThere are no articles in Swahili. A word such as ''kitabu'' \"book\" may be taken to mean either \"the book\" or \"a book\" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as ''kitabu hicho'' \"that (aforementioned) book\", ''kitabu kimoja'' \"one book\", ''kitabu fulani'' \"some (particular) book\", ''kitabu chochote'' \"any book (at all)\".\n\n===Demonstrative===\n\nThe demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types:\n* Proximal (\"this, these\"), referring to something near the speaker. It is formed by prefixing the verbal concord with ''hV-'' where \"V\" stands for a vowel identical to the vowel of the next syllable.\n* Distal (\"that, those\"), referring to something far from both speaker and listener. It is formed by suffixing ''-le'' to the verbal concord.\n* Medial/Referential (\"the aforementioned\"), referring to something that has been previously mentioned. It may also refer to something nearer to the listener than the speaker. It is formed by replacing the final vowel of the proximal demonstrative with the ''o'' (with consonant changes such as ''ki'' becoming ''ch'' etc.).\n\nThere is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as ''na'' and ''ndi-''. This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Proximal\n! Distal\n!

The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article-like role.\n\n=== Other determiners ===\nThe words ''-ote'' \"all\", ''-o-ote'' \"any\", ''-pi'' \"which\" and ''-enyewe'' \"-self\", \"-selves\"'','' appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, ''-o-ote'' was frequently written as two words (e.g. ''ye yote'', ''vyo vyote'') however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions ''-a'' and ''-enye'' as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" |Determiners\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>Prepositions</small>\n!<small>Verbal Prefix</small>\n|-\n!

These may be used with or without the pronoun: ''sisi sote'' or simply ''sote'' can mean \"all of us\", \"we all\". When used with the form ''wote'', the meaning is \"both\": ''sisi wote'' \"both of us\", \"we both\".\n# The irregular form ''wepi'' is used to avoid clashes with the word ''wapi'' meaning \"where\".\n# The word ''vipi'' may be used to ask \"which\" of class 8 nouns (e.g. ''vitabu vipi?'' \"which books?\"), but, as is typical for class 8, can also be understood adverbially, following a verb to mean \"how?\".\n# The usual word for \"where\" or \"which place\" is ''wapi'', however some sources list a regular form ''papi''.\n\n==Adjectives==\n\nThe term \"adjective\", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as \"true adjectives\" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: ''inflecting adjectives'', which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and ''invariable adjectives'', which do not take a prefix.\n\nAll adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:\n* Inflecting adjectives are true adjectives which are prefixed with an adjective concord.\n* Plain adjectives are true adjectives which do not take concord prefixes.\n* Relatives are relativised verbs which can be used as adjectives.\n* Genitives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the genitive preposition ''-a''.\n* Ornatives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the ornative preposition ''-enye''.\n\n===Inflecting Adjectives===\n\nInflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal ''u-'' prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival ''m-'' prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.\n\nMost inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either ''e'' (for example, ''-ekundu'' \"red\") or ''i'' (e.g. ''-ingi'' \"many, much\"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: ''-ovu'' \"evil, wicked\", which is '''''mw'''ovu'' in class 1 and '''''wa'''ovu'' in class 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Nominally prefixed\n|-\n!

On adjectives with stems of more than one syllable, it only appears as a prenasalisation of the following consonants: ''b'' \u2192 '''mb''', ''d'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''g'' \u2192 '''ng''', ''j'' \u2192 '''nj''', ''l'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''r'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''v'' \u2192 '''mv''', ''w'' \u2192 '''mb''', ''z'' \u2192 '''nz'''. Elsewhere, it disappears. In addition, the monosyllabic adjective stem ''-pya'' \"new\" has the form ''mpya'', whereby the ''m-'' constitutes the stressed syllable.\n# The adjective ''-ema'' \"good, kind, nice\" has the irregular form ''njema'' in class 9 and 10 instead of the expected form ''*nyema''.\n# In modern standard Swahili, adjectives in class 14 take the prefix ''m(w)-'', however, in an earlier stage of the language, they took the prefix ''u-/w-'' which is still preserved in some idiomatic phrases but has otherwise disappeared, marking the almost complete merge of classes 11 and 14.\nThe adjective ''-ingine'' \"other\", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms '''''lingine''''' in class six, '''''ingine''''' or '''''yingine''''' in class 9 and '''''zingine''''' in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes:'' '''jengine''', '''lengine''', '''nyengine''', '''yengine''''' and'' '''zengine''''' sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are '''''jingine''''' for class 6 and '''''nyingine''''' for classes 9 and 10.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gromova|first=Nelly|title=MASWALI MACHACHE YA USANIFISHAJI WA KISWAHILI (JINGINE AU LINGINE?)|url=http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/9466/15_09_Gromova.pdf|journal=Swahili Forum|volume=15 |year=2008|pages=115\u2013120|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Swahili grammar and workbook|last=Fid\u00e8le|first=Mpiranya|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781315750699|location=London|pages=37|oclc=878224907}}</ref>\n\nThe numerals ''-moja'' \"one\", ''-wili'' \"two\", ''-tatu'' \"three\", ''-nne'' \"four\", ''-tano'' \"five\" and ''-nane'' \"eight\", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. \n* ''mtu '''m'''moja'' \"one person\", ''watu '''wa'''wili'' \"two people\", ''watu ishirini na '''m'''moja'' \"twenty-one people\", ''watu ishirini na '''wa'''wili'' \"twenty-two people\"\n* ''kitabu '''ki'''moja'' \"one book\", ''vitabu '''vi'''wili'' \"two books\", ''vitabu ishirini na '''ki'''moja'' \"twenty-one books\", ''vitabu ishirini na '''vi'''wili'' \"twenty-two books\"\n* ''nyumba moja'' \"one house\", ''nyumba '''mb'''ili'' \"two houses\", ''nyumba ishirini na moja'' \"twenty-one houses\", ''nyumba ishirini na '''mb'''ili'' \"twenty-two houses\"\n\n=== Invariable adjectives ===\nInvariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as ''safi'' \"clean\", ''ghali'' \"expensive\", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as ''faini'', from English \"fine\". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as ''msichana kiziwi'' \"Deaf girl\", which has a class 1 prefix ''m-'' and a class 7 prefix ''ki-''. Numbers loaned from Arabic: ''sita'' \"six\", ''saba'' \"seven\" and ''tisa'' \"nine\", ''ishirini'' \"twenty\", etc., as well as the native Bantu number ''kumi'' \"ten\", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective ''gani'' \"what kind of\" or, colloquially, \"which\" is also invariable.\n* ''watu tisa'' \"nine people\"\n* ''vitabu tisa'' \"nine books\"\n* ''nyumba tisa'' \"nine houses\"\n\n===Relatives===\n\nRelatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives \"open\" and \"dead\", however the verbs ''kufa'' \"to die\" and ''kufunguliwa'' \"to be opened\", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use:\n* ''ndege aliyekufa'' \"dead bird\" (bird which died)\n* ''ndege waliokufa'' \"dead birds\" (birds which died)\n* ''mlango uliofunguliwa'' \"open door\" (door which was opened)\n* ''milango iliyofunguliwa'' \"open doors\" (doors which were opened)\n* ''dirisha lililofunguliwa'' \"open window\" (window which was opened)\n* ''madirisha yaliyofunguliwa'' \"open windows\" (windows which were opened)\n\n===Genitive adjectives===\nAnother construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive preposition ''-a'']]. The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined [[#Genitive_-a|here]].\n\nIn many cases, the noun introduced in a genitive adjective phrase receives an additional ''ki-'' prefix, such as ''-a kimataifa'' \"international\" (from ''mataifa'' \"nations\") and ''-a kihistoria'' \"historic\" (from ''historia'' \"history\").\n\n===Ornative construction===\nYet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the [[Ornative case|ornative]] construction using ''-enye''. Some examples of adjectival phrases with ''-enye'' include ''-enye nguvu'' \"strong\" (with strength), ''-enye nywele fupi'' \"short-haired\" (having short hair), and ''-enye senta moja'' \"concentric\" (having one centre). The forms of ''-enye'' as well as some more examples of use can be seen [[#Ornative_-enye|here]].\n\n==Verbs==\nLike nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|tense, aspect, mood]] and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as ''-sema'' \"say\", ''-andika'' \"to write\", ''-la'' \"to eat\". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with ''ku-'' or, for a couple of verbs only, ''kw-'', such as ''kusema'' \"to say\", ''kuandika'' \"to write\", ''kula'' \"to eat\".\n\n===Overview of verb structure===\n\nPrefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE.\n\n* '''S'''ubject prefix\n* [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|'''T'''AM]] prefix (or usually '''T'''ense prefix)\n* '''R'''elative prefix\n* '''O'''bject prefix\n* '''V'''erb stem \n* '''E'''xtension(s) (meaning \"derivative suffix(es)\"), or, more broadly '''E'''nding (including also the inflectional suffixes ''-i'' and ''-e'').\n\nIn learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as [[infix]]es. It should, however, be noted that the term ''infix'', as used by linguists, refers only to a [[morpheme]] (\u2248 part of a word) that is inserted ''within'' another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes.\n\nHere is an example of a verb with all slots filled:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"6\" |''nilipokupikia''\n|-\n!S\n!T\n!R\n!O\n!V\n!E\n|-\n|''ni-''\n|''-li-''\n|''-po-''\n|''-ku-''\n|''-pik(a)*''\n|''-i(a)*''\n|-\n|1S-\n| -PST-\n| -CL16.REL-\n| -2S-\n| -cook\n| -APPL\n|-\n|<small>\"I\"</small>\n|<small>\"earlier\"</small>\n|<small>\"when\"</small>\n|<small>\"you\"</small>\n|<small>\"cook\"</small>\n|<small>\"for\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"when I cooked for you\"\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This \"(a)\" appears when this is the final element of the word and is otherwise dropped.\n\nMost of the time, verbs will not have all slots filled.

In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with ''-a''. All verbs of native Bantu origin end with ''-a'', including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are ''kuanguka'' \"to fall\", ''kufanya'' \"to do, to make\", ''kuona'' \"to see\", ''kuwaza'' \"to think\", ''kusaidia'' \"to help\". The final ''-a'' is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming ''-i'' in the present negative, and ''-e'' in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker ''-ni'' also triggers this final ''-a'' to become ''-e.''\n\n'''Short verbs''' are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as  ''kula'' \"to eat\", ''kunywa'' \"to drink\", ''kuja'' \"to come\", ''kupa'' \"to give\". The verbs ''kwenda'' \"to go\" and ''kwisha'' \"to finish\" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as ''kuenda'' and ''kuisha''). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix ''ku-'' is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed '''monosyllabic verbs''', however this is problematic as the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as ''-p-'' \"give\"). Furthermore, when the final ''-a'' is considered part of the stem, this excludes ''-enda'' and ''-isha'', which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in ''-a'' and undergo the same ''-i'' and ''-e'' alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable ''-ku-'' in certain verb forms. This intrusive ''-ku-''  (which may be [[Interlinear gloss|glossed]] as <small>EXT</small> for \"extension\") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] prefixes (-''na-'', ''-me-'', ''-li-'', ''-ta-'', ''-sha-'', ''-nge-'', ''-ngeli-'') and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This ''-ku-'' disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (''-a-'', ''hu-'', ''-ki-'', ''-ka-'', ''-ku-'', ''-si-''). (The TAM prefix ''-ja-'' can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of ''-enda'' and ''-isha'' takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their ''-kw-'' extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the ''-ku-'' extension in other short verbs.\n\nThe '''Loan verbs''', also frequently called '''\"Arabic\" verbs''',  are those which do not end in ''-a'' in the infinitive. Not all verbs from Arabic are in this group, however, such as ''kusaidia'', which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in ''-a'' and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as ''kukisi'' \"to kiss\" and ''kuripoti'' \"to report\", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in ''-a''. The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes ''-e'' and ''-i'' that the verbs ending in ''-a'' do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in ''si-ku-sahau-<s>\u00d8</s>'' which could either mean \"I did not forget\" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST-forget-<s>\u00d8</s>) or \"I do not forget you\" (NEG.1s-2s-forget-<s>PRES.NEG</s>).\n\n===Subject and object concords===\n\nBoth the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by ''prefixes'' or ''concords'' attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a [[pro-drop]] language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.\n\nSix different forms of verbal concord exist.\n\nFor the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ''ha-'' to the beginning, except for the irregular forms ''si-'' (instead of ''*hani-''), ''hu-'' (instead of ''*hau-'') and ''ha-'' (instead of ''*haa-'') which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.\n\nAdditionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix ''yu-'' is used instead of ''a-'' as the subject of a locative copula. (This ''yu-'' can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of ''yu-'' is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ''ha-''.\n\nBefore the present 'indefinite' marker ''-a-'', subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition ''-a''.\n\nObject concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!\n! colspan=\"4\" |Positive\n! colspan=\"2\" |Negative\n|-\n!

Very frequently, however, the suffix ''-eni'' is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ''nina'''wa'''on'''eni''''' \"I see you all.\"  This suffix causes the final ''a'' of Bantu verbs to shift to ''e''. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply ''-ni''. Some speakers use the prefix ''-ku-'' (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix ''-(e)ni'', as in ''nina'''ku'''on'''eni''''' \"I see you all.\"\n\nThe reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like ''myself'', ''yourself'', ''himself'' and so on.\n* '''''ni'''na'''ji'''tetea'' \"I defend myself\"\n* '''''a'''na'''ji'''ona'' \"he sees himself\" (idiomatically, may mean: \"he is conceited\")\n\n===Infinitive===\n\nThe infinitive is a [[verbal noun]], and belongs to the nominal class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix '''''ku-'''''. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix ''-ni'', as in ''kuangukani'' \"in falling\" (i.e. \"while falling\"). It corresponds to the English [[Infinitive#English|infinitive]] or [[Gerund#Gerunds in English|gerund]]. Infinitives cannot take subject, relative or TAM prefixes, but they may take object prefixes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the infinitive\n|\n!common verbs\n!short verbs\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Affirmative\n| '''''ku___a'''''\n|'''''ku___a'''''\n|'''''ku___'''''\n|-\n|'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Negative\n| '''''kuto(ku)___a'''''\n|'''''kutoku___a'''''\n|'''''kuto(ku)___'''''\n|-\n|'''''kuto(ku)'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|'''''kuto(ku)'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|'''''kuto(ku)'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\nThe negative infinitive is derived from the verb ''kutoa'' \"to subtract\", \"to not do\", although it is rarely encountered in its full form for this use.

All together, [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|Tense, Aspect and Mood]] may be abbreviated as TAM.\n\nThe following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \"short\" and \"common verbs\", with \"loan verbs\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the ''-ni'' suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this ''-(e)ni'' prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nSummary of TAM forms\n!\n!Tense, Aspect,\n\nMood\n!Subject\n!TAM\n!Relative\n!Object\n/ Extension\n!Verb\nSTEM\n!Final Vowel\n!2P\n!Relative\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Indicative\nBasic\n\nTenses\n|[[#Past|Past]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''li'''-\n|(REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Past|Past Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ku'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Perfect|Perfect]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''me'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Perfect|Perfect Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ja'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / (EXT)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present 'Definite']]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''na'''-\n|(REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present 'Indefinite']]\n|<u>SUB*</u>\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Habitual|Present Habitual]]\n|''&mdash;''\n|'''hu'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''i'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ta'''-\n|(-'''ka'''-REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ta'''- / -'''to'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Relative\nForms\n|Tenseless Relative\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|REL\n|-\n|Tenseless Negative Relative\n|SUB\n| -'''si'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Contextual\nTenses\n|Situational\n|SUB\n| -'''ki'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Consecutive\n|SUB\n| -'''ka'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Irrealis\n|Irrealis Present\n|SUB\n| -'''nge'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Present Negative 1\n|SUB\n| -'''singe'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Present Negative 2\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n| -'''nge'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past\n|SUB\n| -'''ngali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past Negative 1\n|SUB\n| -'''singali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past Negative 2\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n| -'''ngali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Imperatives\nand\n\nSubjunctives\n|Imperative Singular (- OBJ)\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;'' / EXT\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Imperative Singular + OBJ\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|OBJ\n|STEM\n| -'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Imperative Plural\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''e'''-\n| -'''ni'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Subjunctive\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Subjunctive Negative\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''si'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Expeditive\nImperatives\n\nand\n\nSubjunctives\n|Expeditive Subjunctive\n|SUB\n| -'''ka'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Exp.

It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ''ji-'') causes the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs to become ''-e''. Note that the ''ji-'' prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of ''-jifunza'' \"to learn\" is ''jifunz<u>e</u>'' \"learn!\" and not ''*jifunza''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the imperative\n|\n!Common verbs\n!Short verbs\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Singular\n|___'''''a'''''\n|'''''ku'''''___'''''a'''''\n|___\n|-\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plural\n|___'''''eni'''''\n|'''''ku'''''___'''''eni'''''\n|___'''''ni'''''\n|-\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''eni'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''eni'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''ni'''''\n|}\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix ''-ni'', is used when addressing multiple people.\n\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n* ''kuja'' \"to come\": '''''njoo''''' (pl. '''''njooni''''')\n* ''kwenda'' \"to go\" : '''''nenda''''' (pl. '''''nendeni''''')\n* ''kuleta'' \"to bring\": '''''lete''''' (pl. '''''leteni''''')\nThe verb ''-acha'' may informally be given the imperative form '''''wacha''''' (pl. '''''wacheni''''').\n\nAdditionally, the verb ''kuwa'' \"to be\" has an irregular imperative form: '''''iwe''''' (pl. '''''iweni'''''), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form '''''kuwa''''' (pl. '''''kuweni''''') or used in the subjunctive (\"polite imperative\") form: '''''uwe''''' (pl. '''''mwe''''').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Swahili: A complete working course|last=D.

These are sometimes termed the \"definite present\" (with '''''-na-''''') and the \"indefinite present\" (with '''''-a-'''''). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=Dorothee|date=|title=SWAHILI AS A TENSE PROMINENT LANGUAGE.

This is outlined [[#Subject and object concords|above]].\n\nIn informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ''ni-'' to collapse into the '''''-na-''''' of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a ''na-'', however short verbs retain their ''-ku-'' extension in the ''-na-'' tense and lose it in the ''-a-'' tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in ''(ni)nakula'' \"I eat\", in the ''-na-'' present tense, versus ''nala'' \"I eat\", in the ''-a-'' present tense.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite, negative)\n|-\n!

Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix '''''-ga''''' or '''''-nga''''' which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving ''tunakunywaga'' or ''tunakunywanga''. The habitual aspect with ''hu-'' is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |'''''Haba na haba hujaza kibaba.'''''\n|-\n|haba\n|na\n|haba\n|'''hu'''-ja(a)-z(a)\n|kibaba\n|-\n|insignificant\n|COM\n|insignificant\n|'''HAB'''-become.full-CAUS\n|1.56.litre.container(CL7)\n|-\n|<small>\"little\"</small>\n|<small>\"and\"</small>\n|<small>\"little\"</small>\n|<small>\"fills, '''as a rule'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"container\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"Little by little, a cup is filled.\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |(Roughly equivalent to \"Slow and steady wins the race,\" or \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\")\n|}\n\n====Past====\n\nThe past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix ''-li-''. Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus ''-ku-''. The positive tense marker ''-li-'' cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension ''-ku-'' (or ''-kw-'') where necessary.  The negative tense marker ''-ku-'' can take stress, meaning that an additional ''-ku-'' extension is not needed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the past tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive past\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''liku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative past\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

For example, the word ''nimepika'' \"I have cooked\" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas ''nilipika'' \"I cooked\" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).\n\nThe perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix '''''-me-'''''. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus '''''-ja-'''''. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker '''''-me-''''' cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs, but the negative marker '''''-ja-''''' is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension ''-ku-'' with '''''-ja-'''''.\n\nSome sources describe the '''''-ja-''''' form as containing more of an implication of \"not yet\" than a simple negation of the '''''-me''-''' form, however the word ''bado'' \"still\", \"not yet\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the perfect tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive perfect\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''meku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative perfect\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja(ku)___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker '''''-me-'''''. It often imparts the meaning of \"already\", emphasising the completeness of the action.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Asante, nimeshakula.'''''\n|-\n|asante\n|ni-me-'''sha'''-ku-l(a)\n|-\n|thank.you\n|1S-PRF-'''ANT'''-EXT-eat\n|-\n|<small>\"thank you\"</small>\n|<small>\"I have '''already''' eaten\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"No thank you, I have already eaten.\"\n|}\nThe anterior marker '''''-sha-''''' is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect ''-me-''. These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker ''-ki-'' where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |'''''Ukishapata kazi, utakuwa na pesa za kutosha.'''''\n|-\n|u-ki-sha-pat(a)\n|kazi\n|u-ta-ku-w(a)\n|na\n|pesa\n|z-a\n|ku-tosh(a)\n|-\n|2S-SITU-'''ANT'''-get\n|work(CL9)\n|2S-FUT-EXT-be\n|COM\n|money(CL10)\n|CL10-GEN\n|INF(CL15)-suffice\n|-\n|<small>\"'''once''' you get\"</small>\n|<small>\"work\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will be\"</small>\n|<small>\"with\"</small>\n|<small>\"money\"</small>\n|<small>\"of\"</small>\n|<small>\"to suffice\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"Once you get a job, you will have enough money.\"\n|}\n\n====Future====\n\nThe future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix '''''-ta-'''''. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with '''''-ta-''''' being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use '''''-to-''''' in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the ''-to-'' of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an ''h-'' at the beginning of the negative word. For example, ''atakuja'' \"s/he will come\" vs. ''<u>h</u>atakuja'' \"s/he will not come\" (or ''<u>h</u>at<u>o</u>kuja''). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from '''''-ta-''''' to '''''-to-''''' in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n\n'''''-Ta-''''' (and likewise '''''-to-''''') cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the future tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive future\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''taku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative future\n(usual)\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''taku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |negative future\n(variant)\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''toku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final ''-a'', where present, to ''-e''-. The so-called \"Arabic verbs\" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable ''-si-'' into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the subjunctive\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive subjunctive\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative subjunctive\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___e'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

This prefix may take stress and thus the extension ''-ku-'' does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form.\n\nThere is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using '''''-sipo-''''' is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of '''''-ki-''''' and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the ''-ku-'' extension ''does'' appear with ''-sipo-'' as the ''-po-'', like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the situational\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |positive situational\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |negative situational\n<small>(conditional only)</small>\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipoku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|}\n\nThe situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \"if\" and \"when\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as ''kama'', ''ikiwa'' or ''endapo'' may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ''ikiwa'' is itself the situational form of the verb ''-wa'' \"to be\", with the class 9 subject prefix ''i-'', literally meaning on its own essentially \"if it is\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |''(Kama) ukitaka kuja, utapaswa kulipa.''\n|-\n|(kama)\n|u-'''ki'''-tak(a)\n|ku-j(a)\n|u-ta-pas(a)-w(a)\n|ku-lip(a)\n|-\n|(if)\n|2S.SBJ-'''SITU'''-want\n|INF(CL15)-come\n|2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS\n|INF(CL15)-pay\n|-\n|<small>(\"if\")</small>\n|<small>\"'''if''' you want\"</small>\n|<small>\"to come\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will be behooved\"</small>\n|<small>\"to pay\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"'''If''' you want to come, you will have to pay.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |''(Kama) usipotaka kuja, hutapaswa kulipa.''\n|-\n|(kama)\n|u-'''si'''-'''po'''-tak(a)\n|ku-j(a)\n|hu-ta-pas(a)-w(a)\n|ku-lip(a)\n|-\n|(if)\n|2S.SBJ-'''NEG'''-'''CL16.REL'''-want\n|INF(CL15)-come\n|NEG.2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS\n|INF(CL15)-pay\n|-\n|<small>(\"if\")</small>\n|<small>\"'''if''' you '''don't''' want\"</small>\n|<small>\"to come\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will not be behooved\"</small>\n|<small>\"to pay\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"'''If''' you '''don't''' want to come, you will not have to pay.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |''Wanajeshi wawili walikuja wakikimbia, wote wawili wakibeba upanga.''\n|-\n|wanajeshi\n|wa-wili\n|wa-li-ku-j(a)\n|wa-'''ki'''-kimbia\n|w-ote\n|wa-wili\n|wa-'''ki'''-beb(a)\n|upanga\n|-\n|soldiers(CL2)\n|CL2-two\n|CL2.SBJ-PST-EXT-come\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-run\n|CL2-all\n|CL2-two\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-carry\n|machete(CL11)\n|-\n|<small>\"soldiers\"</small>\n|<small>\"two\"</small>\n|<small>\"they came\"</small>\n|<small>\"(they) runn'''ing'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"all\"</small>\n|<small>\"two\"</small>\n|<small>\"(they) carry'''ing'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"machete\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"Two soldiers came runn'''ing''', both of them carry'''ing''' a machete.\"\n|}\nThe situational may appear in compound progressive tenses.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |''Tulipofika, alikuwa akila kwa pupa haraka iwezekanavyo.''\n|-\n|tu-li-po-fik(a)\n|a-li-ku-w(a)\n|a-'''ki'''-l(a)\n|kwa\n|pupa\n|haraka\n|i-wezekan(a)-vyo\n|-\n|1P.SBJ-PST-CL16.REL-arrive\n|CL1.SBJ-PST-EXT-be\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-eat\n|INST\n|greed(CL9)\n|quickly\n|CL9.SBJ-be.possible-CL8.REL\n|-\n|\"when we arrived\"\n|\"he was\"\n|\"(he) eating\"\n|\"with\"\n|\"greed\"\n|\"quickly\"\n|\"as it is possible\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"When we arrived, he was ('''in the middle of''') eat'''ing''' greedily as quickly as possible.\"\n|}\n\n==== Consecutive ====\nThe '''consecutive''' or '''narrative''' tense is formed with the TAM prefix '''''-ka-'''''.

Both the [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (if-clause) and [[Apodosis (linguistics)|apodosis]] (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first.

The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] relative using ''amba-''.\n\nThe following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled \"REL\". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is ''-taka-'' with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple ''-ta-'' which occurs otherwise.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tense, Aspect,\n\nMood\n!Subject\n!TAM\n!Relative\n!Object\n/ Extension\n!Verb\nSTEM\n!Final Vowel\n!Relative\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tensed\n|[[#Past|Past]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''li'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''na'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''taka'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Tenseless\n|Positive\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|REL\n|-\n|Negative\n|SUB\n| -'''si'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|}\nThe relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with ''na-'' and ''ndi-''. Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing ''o'' (the so-called \"o of reference\")\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb '''''-wa''''' (infinitive '''''kuwa''''') is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of ''essence'' versus a copula of ''state or location''. This is similar to the distinction between [[Romance copula|''ser'' and ''estar'']] in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique [[Continuative aspect|continuative]] form.\n\n==== Essence ====\n===== Invariable copula =====\nThe invariable copula '''''ni''''' is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]) refer to one and the same referent:\n* ''Mimi '''ni''' Bahati.'' \"I '''am''' Bahati.\"\n* ''Dunia '''ni''' sayari tunapoishi.'' \"Earth '''is''' the planet we live on.\"\nIt is also used to express membership of a class (a [[subset]] relationship):\n* ''Wao '''ni''' wanasayansi.'' \"They '''are''' scientists.\"\n* ''Jua '''ni''' nyota.'' \"The sun '''is''' a star.\"\n* ''Miti '''ni''' mimea mikubwa.'' \"Trees '''are''' large plants.\"\nIt may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic.\n* ''Babake '''ni''' mrefu sana.'' \"Her father '''is''' very tall.\"\n* ''Mji huyu '''ni''' mdogo.'' \"This town '''is''' small.\"\n* ''Misuli yako '''ni''' kama chuma.'' Your muscles '''are''' like steel. \nThe negative form '''''si''''' can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning:\n* ''Wewe '''si''' Bahati.'' \"You '''are not''' Bahati.\"\n* ''Jua '''si''' sayari.'' \"The sun '''is not''' a planet.\" \n* ''Pomboo '''si''' wadogo.'' \"Dolphins '''are not''' small.\"\nBecause '''''ni''''' and '''''si''''' do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Present\n! colspan=\"2\" |Past\n|-\n!Number\n!Person\n!Positive\n!Negative\n!Positive\n!Negative\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Singular\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1st\n|''mimi '''ni'''''\n|''mimi '''si'''''\n|''nilikuwa''\n|''sikuwa''\n|-\n|<small>I am</small>\n|<small>I am not</small>\n|<small>I was</small>\n|<small>I was not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2nd\n|''wewe '''ni'''''\n|''wewe '''si'''''\n|''ulikuwa''\n|''hukuwa''\n|-\n|<small>you are</small>\n|<small>you are not</small>\n|<small>you were</small>\n|<small>you were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3rd\n|''yeye '''ni'''''\n|''yeye '''si'''''\n|''alikuwa''\n|''hakuwa''\n|-\n|<small>s/he is</small>\n|<small>s/he is not</small>\n|<small>s/he was</small>\n|<small>s/he was not</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Plural\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1st\n|''sisi '''ni'''''\n|''sisi '''si'''''\n|''tulikuwa''\n|''hatukuwa''\n|-\n|<small>we are</small>\n|<small>we are not</small>\n|we were\n|<small>we were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2nd\n|''nyinyi '''ni'''''\n|''nyinyi '''si'''''\n|''mlikuwa''\n|''hamkuwa''\n|-\n|<small>you are</small>\n|<small>you are not</small>\n|<small>you were</small>\n|<small>you were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3rd\n|''wao '''ni'''''\n|''wao '''si'''''\n|''walikuwa''\n|''hawakuwa''\n|-\n|they are\n|<small>they are not</small>\n|they were\n|they were not\n|}\nA sentence begun with '''''ni''''' or '''''si''''' without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject \"it\" in English.

The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with ''na''. In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Person\n/ Class\n!Positive\n!Negative\n!<small>Translation</small>\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''ndimi, ndiye''\n|''simi, siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) I\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n| ''ndiwe, ndiye''\n|''siwe, siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''ndisi, ndio''\n|''sio, (sisi)*''\n|<small>\"it is (not) we\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''ndinyi, ndio''\n|''sinyi, sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1\n|''ndiye''\n|''siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) s/he\"</small>\n|-\n! 2\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 3\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 4\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 5\n|''ndilo''\n|''silo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 6\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 7\n|''ndicho''\n|''sicho''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 8\n|''ndivyo''\n|''sivyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\", \"it is (not) so\"</small>\n|-\n! 9\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 10\n|''ndizo''\n|''sizo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 11\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 14\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 15\n|''ndiko''\n|''siko''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n!16\n|''ndipo''\n|''sipo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) (t)here\"</small>\n|-\n! 17\n|''ndiko''\n|''siko''\n|<small>\"it is (not) around (t)here\"</small>\n|-\n!18\n|''ndimo''\n|''simo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) in (t)here\"</small>\n|}\n \n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The form ''sisi'' \"it is not us\" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun ''sisi'' \"we\", \"us\". Instead it is virtually always replaced with ''sio''.\n\nForms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |'''''Mimi ndiye niliyewaona kwanza.'''''\n|-\n|'''mimi'''\n|ndi-'''ye'''\n|ni-li-'''ye'''-wa-on(a)\n|kwanza\n|-\n|'''1S'''\n|FOC.COP-'''CL1'''\n|1S-PST-'''REL.CL1'''-CL2-see\n|first\n|-\n|<small>\"I\"</small>\n|<small>\"am '''the one'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"(I) '''who''' saw them\"</small>\n|<small>\"first\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"I'm the one who saw them first.\"\n|}\nCompare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Niliwaona kwanza.'''''\n|-\n|ni-li-wa-on(a)\n|kwanza\n|-\n|1S-PST-CL2-see\n|first\n|-\n|<small>\"I saw them\"</small>\n|<small>\"first\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"I saw them first.\"\n|}\n\n==== Location ====\nLocation is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo''. The class 1 subject concord ''a-'' (negative: ''ha-'') is however replaced with ''yu-'' (negative: ''hayu-'').\n\nThe three clitics, ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo'' correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate \"definite\", \"indefinite\" and \"internal\" location respectively. For example, ''wapo'' means essentially \"they are here/there\", ''wako'' means \"they are around here/there\" and ''wamo'' means \"they are in here/there\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Positive\n! colspan=\"3\" |Negative\n|-\n!Person\n/ Class\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Internal\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Internal\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''nipo''\n|''niko''\n|''nimo''\n|''sipo''\n|''siko''\n|''simo''\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''hupo''\n|''huko''\n|''humo''\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''tupo''\n|''tuko''\n|''tumo''\n|''hatupo''\n|''hatuko''\n|''hatumo''\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''mpo''\n|''mko''\n|''mmo''\n|''hampo''\n|''hamko''\n|''hammo''\n|-\n! 1\n|''yupo''\n|''yuko''\n|''yumo''\n|''hayupo''\n|''hayuko''\n|''hayumo''\n|-\n! 2\n|''wapo''\n|''wako''\n|''wamo''\n|''hawapo''\n|''hawako''\n|''hawamo''\n|-\n! 3\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 4\n|''ipo''\n|''iko''\n|''imo''\n|''haipo''\n|''haiko''\n|''haimo''\n|-\n! 5\n|''lipo''\n|''liko''\n|''limo''\n|''halipo''\n|''haliko''\n|''halimo''\n|-\n! 6\n|''yapo''\n|''yako''\n|''yamo''\n|''hayapo''\n|''hayako''\n|''hayamo''\n|-\n! 7\n|''kipo''\n|''kiko''\n|''kimo''\n|''hakipo''\n|''hakiko''\n|''hakimo''\n|-\n! 8\n|''vipo''\n|''viko''\n|''vimo''\n|''havipo''\n|''haviko''\n|''havimo''\n|-\n! 9\n|''ipo''\n|''iko''\n|''imo''\n|''haipo''\n|''haiko''\n|''haimo''\n|-\n! 10\n|''zipo''\n|''ziko''\n|''zimo''\n|''hazipo''\n|''haziko''\n|''hazimo''\n|-\n! 11\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 14\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 15\n|''kupo''\n|''kuko''\n|''kumo''\n|''hakupo''\n|''hakuko''\n|''hakumo''\n|-\n!16\n|''<small>papo</small>''\n|''<small>pako</small>''\n|''<small>pamo</small>''\n|''<small>hapapo</small>''\n|''<small>hapako</small>''\n|''<small>hapamo</small>''\n|-\n! 17\n|''<small>kupo</small>''\n|''<small>kuko</small>''\n|''<small>kumo</small>''\n|''<small>hakupo</small>''\n|''<small>hakuko</small>''\n|''<small>hakumo</small>''\n|-\n!18\n|''<small>mpo</small>''\n|''<small>mko</small>''\n|''<small>mmo</small>''\n|''<small>hampo</small>''\n|''<small>hamko</small>''\n|''<small>hammo</small>''\n|}\nUnder a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance ''nipo hapa'' \"I am here\" is regarded as correct but ''niko hapa'' \"I am here\" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with ''-ko'' over the other forms, such that ''niko hapa'' is very common.\n\n==== State ====\nTemporary states of being are frequently expressed as if they were locations, generally with the ''-ko'' clitic. In older forms of Swahili, this ''-ko'' was generally absent, with the subject prefix appearing as a standalone word for the copula. Nowadays, this short form is less usual although it is still frequently encountered in common phrases such as ''U hali gani?'' ('How are you?', literally 'You are in what condition?')\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Yu(ko) tayari.'''''\n|-\n|'''yu-(ko)'''\n|tayari\n|-\n|'''CL1-(REF.CL17)'''\n|ready\n|-\n|<small>\"'''She/he is'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"ready\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"She is ready.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Mbona u(ko) kimya?'''''\n|-\n|mbona\n|'''u-(ko)'''\n|kimya\n|-\n|why.EMPH\n|'''CL2-(REF.CL17)'''\n|silent\n|-\n|<small>\"why\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"silent\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Why are you silent.\"\n|}\nNote that the standalone form of the 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural prefix ''m-'' is not *''m'' but ''mu''. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Je, mu wazima?'''''\n|-\n|je\n|mu\n|wa-zima\n|-\n|Q\n|2P\n|CL2-healthy\n|-\n|<small>\"Question:\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"healthy\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Are you well?\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Je, mko wazima?'''''\n|-\n|je\n|m-ko\n|wa-zima\n|-\n|Q\n|2P-REF.CL17\n|CL2-healthy\n|-\n|<small>\"Question:\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"healthy\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Are you well?\"\n|}\n==== Relative forms ====\nIn the present tense, relative forms of the copula are formed with the subject prefix, the stem '''''-li-''''' in the positive and '''''-si-''''' in the negative, and the suffixed relative marker for the required noun class.

Its equivalent is ''kuwa na'', literally 'to be with', using the [[#Comitative_na|comitative preposition ''na'']].

For example, the verbs ''kulewa'' (\"to get drunk\"), ''kuchoka'' (\"to become tired\") and ''kuchelewa'' (\"to become late\") describe the respective changes to state from \"not drunk\" to \"drunk\", from \"not tired\" to \"tired\" and from \"not late\" to \"late\". These may be regarded as inherently [[inchoative verb]]s. There is, however, no equivalent ''[[stative verb]]'' for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. \"to be [state]\". Stative meanings such as \"be drunk\", \"be tired\" and \"be late\" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the [[#Perfect|perfect marker '''''-me-''''']] (or, in the negative, '''''-ja-'''''). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \nExamples\n|-\n!

The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the [[#Mediopassive|mediopassive]] below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition ''na'', which is here the equivalent of the English \"by\", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to \"and\" or \"with\".\n\n==== Mediopassive ====\nThe [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]] suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involved ends in ''-ka'' and generally the harmonic ''i'' or ''e'' before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost ''l'' of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic ''i'' or ''e''. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nMediopassive suffix on common verbs\n!\n!Consonant-final \nroot\n\n(Consonant + ''-a'')\n!Vowel-final \nroot\n\n(Vowel + ''-a'')\n|-\n!Preceding syllable\nhas /a/, /i/, /u/ or /m\u0329/\n|''-ika''\n|''-ka'', ''-lika''\n|-\n!Preceding syllable\nhas /e/ or /o/\n|''-eka''\n|''-ka'', ''-leka''\n|}\n\n* ''-vunja'' \"to break (something)\" \u2192 ''-vunj'''ika''''' \"to break\" (intransitive)\n* ''-pika'' \"to cook (something)\" \u2192 ''-pik'''ika''''' \"to cook\" (intransitive)\n* ''-elewa'' \"to understand (something)\" \u2192 ''-elew'''eka''''' \"to be understood\"\n* ''-sikia'' \"to hear\" \u2192 ''-siki'''ka''''' \"to be heard; be audible\"\n* ''-kaa'' \"to sit; stay; inhabit\" \u2192 ''-ka'''lika''''' \"to be inhabited; be inhabitable\"\n* ''-zoea'' \"to get used to; grow accustomed to\" \u2192 ''-zoe'''lika''''' \"to become customary\"\n\nAs with the other derivational suffixes (or \"extensions\"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding '''''-ika''''' or '''''-eka''''' according to vowel harmony rules. The exceptions are those ending in '''''-au''''' which use '''''-lika''''.\n\n* ''-haribu'' \"to spoil (something); ruin; destroy\" \u2192 ''-harib'''ika''''' \"to spoil; get spoiled; get ruined; get destroyed\"\n* ''-sahau'' \"to forget\" \u2192 ''-sahau'''lika''''' \"to cook\" (intransitive)\n* ''-kebehi'' \"to ridicule; make fun of\" \u2192 ''-kebeh'''ika''''' \"to get ridiculed; get made fun of\"\n\nIn learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the \"'''stative''' extension\" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seidl|first=Amanda|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Alexis|date=2003|title=Statives and reciprocal morphology in Swahili|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/users/Alexis.Dimitriadis/personal/papers/discon-long-ms04.pdf|journal=Typologie des Langues d'Afrique et Universaux de la Grammaire|volume= 1: Approches transversales, domaine bantou|pages=239\u2013284|via=}}</ref> For example, the mediopassive verb ''-vunj'''ika''''' \"to break; go to pieces\" contrasts with its source verb ''-vunja'' \"to break; make go to pieces\", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic \u2014 both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time \u2014 but in that the subject of ''-vunjika'' is equivalent to the object of ''-vunja'', and the subject of ''-vunja'' is completely absent from a clause with ''-vunj'''ika'''''. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |Active transitive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Juma alivunja dirisha.''\n|-\n|Juma\n|a-li-vunj(a)\n|dirisha\n|-\n|[male name]\n|CL1-PST-break(TR)\n|(CL5)window\n|-\n|<small>\"Juma\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he broke\"</small>\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Juma '''broke''' the window.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |Passive transitive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Dirisha lilivunjwa (na Juma).''\n|-\n|dirisha\n|li-li-vunj(a)-'''w(a)'''\n|(na Juma)\n|-\n|(CL5)window\n|CL5-PST-break(TR)-'''PASS'''\n|(COM [male name])\n|-\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|<small>\"it was broken\"</small>\n|<small>(\"by Juma\"</small>)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The window '''was broken''' (by Juma).\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |Mediopassive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Dirisha lilivunjika.''\n|-\n|dirisha\n|li-li-vunj(a)-'''ik(a)'''\n|-\n|(CL5)window\n|CL5-PST-break(TR)-'''MEDIOPASS'''\n|-\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|<small>\"it broke\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"The window '''broke'''.\"\n|}\nMediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence \"''Dirisha li'''me'''vunjika''\" means either \"The window <u>has</u> broken,\" or \"The window <u>is</u> broken.\" What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, ''-vunjika'', does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from \"whole; intact\" to \"broken; in pieces\". The perfect ''-me-'' here indicates that one is concerned with the state after the dynamic process.\n\n==== Reversive ====\n==== Suffix stacking ====\nSuffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili.\n\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 -''andik'''wa''''' \"to be written\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''isha''''' \"to cause to write\" \u2192 ''-andikish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to write\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''ia''''' \"to write to\" \u2192 ''-andiki'''wa''''' \"to be written to\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''ia''''' \"to write to\" \u2192 ''-andiki'''ana''''' \"to write to each other\" \u2192 -''andikian'''isha''''' \"to cause to write to each other\" \u2192 -''andikianish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to write to each other\"\n\nHere is another rather more implausible example:\n* ''-la'' \"to eat\" \n: \u2192 ''-l'''ika''''' \"to be edible\" \n:: \u2192 ''-lik'''ia''''' \"to be edible to\" \n::: \u2192 ''-liki'''ana''''' \"to be edible to each other\" \n:::: \u2192 ''-likian'''isha''''' \"to cause to be edible to each other\" \n::::: \u2192 ''-likianish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to be edible to each other\"\n\n== Prepositions ==\n=== Comitative ''na'' ===\nIn addition to functioning as a conjunction meaning \"and\", ''na'' is also a very common preposition meaning:\n\n# ''\"With\"'' in a [[Comitative case|comitative]] sense (\"together with\", \"along with\", \"accompanied by\"), often occurring after reciprocal verbs ending in ''-ana''.   ''Njoo '''na'''mi.'' \"Come with me.\"   ''Yuko pale pamoja '''na''' rafiki zake.'' \"She is there with her friends.\"   ''Dada yako ananfanana '''na''' mama yenu.'' \"Your sister looks like your mother.\n# \"''With''\" in an [[Ornative case|ornative]] sense (\"having\") when appearing with the verb ''kuwa'' \"to be\" to form ''kuwa na'' \"to have\".    ''Ni'''na''' pesa zako.'' \"I have your money.\"  ''Kusingekuwa '''na''' mbu.'' \"There wouldn't be any mosquitos.\" (See: [[#'To_have'|'to have']])\n# \"''By''\" when introducing the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] in a passive sentence.   ''Alipendwa sana '''na''' kila mtu kijijini.'' \"He was loved by everyone in the village.\"\n\nShortened forms of pronouns are frequently suffixed to ''na'', both when ''na'' is used as a preposition.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Person\n/ Class\n!Short\n!Full form\n!<small>Translation</small>\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''nami''\n|''na mimi''\n|<small>\"with me\", \"by me\", \"and I\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n|''nawe''\n|''na wewe''\n|<small>\"with you\", \"by you\", \"and you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''nasi''\n|''na sisi''\n|<small>\"with us\", \"by us\", \"and we\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''nanyi''\n|''na ninyi''\n|<small>\"with you\", \"by you\", \"and you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1\n|''naye''\n|''na yeye''\n|<small>\"with him/her\", \"by her/him\", \"and she/he\"</small>\n|-\n! 2\n|''nao''\n|''na wao''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 3\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 4\n|''nayo''\n|''na hiyo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 5\n|''nalo''\n|''na hilo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 6\n|''nayo''\n|''na hayo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 7\n|''nacho''\n|''na hicho''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 8\n|''navyo''\n|''na hivyo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 9\n|''nayo''\n|''na hiyo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 10\n|''nazo''\n|''na hizo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 11\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 14\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 15\n|''nako''\n|''na huko''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [action]</small>\n|-\n!16\n|''napo''\n|''na hapo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|-\n! 17\n|''nako''\n|''na huko''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|-\n!18\n|''namu''\n|''na humu''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|}\n\n=== Genitive ''-a'' ===\n\nThe genitive preposition ''-a'' (sometimes termed a \"connector\", \"possessive\" or \"associative\" preposition) has a similar role to that of the [[genitive case]] of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \"of\". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:\n\n* '''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''a mwanafunzi'' \"the student's book\" (\"book of student\")\n* '''''vi'''tabu '''vy'''a mwanafunzi'' \"the student's books\" (\"books of student\")\n\nThe equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as ''taa ya barabarani'' \"traffic light\", \"street light\", which is literally equivalent to \"light of road-LOC\".\n\nThe personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example:\n\n*'''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''ake'' \"his/her book\"\n\nThe genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see [[#Subject_and_object_concords|here]]), plus ''-a''. There are some sound changes that happen. ''U-'' and ''i-'' become their equivalent semivowels ''w-'' and ''y-'' respectively. After consonants, this '''y''' is generally dropped although ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' become ''ch-'' and ''vy-''. The class 1 verbal concord ''a-'' is an exception, being replaced with ''w-'' in the genitive construction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! <small>Verbal subject concord</small>\n!

It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of ''-a''. Where there is no 15 or class 17 [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]], its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an [[instrumental case|instrumental]] use of \"by (means of)\", \"using\" or \"with\". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by ''kwenye'' for inanimate referents.\n\n* ''Tulikuja kwa miguu.'' \"We came on foot.\" (Literally: \"We came by feet.\")\n* ''Alirudi kwa Rehema.'' \"She returned to Rehema's (place).\"\n\n=== Ornative ''-enye'' ===\n\nThe [[Ornative case|ornative]] preposition ''-enye'' essentially means \"having\" or \"with\" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive '''-a''' with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix ''mw-'' instead of ''w-''. The word ''-enye'' is followed by a noun. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It constructs whole words by joining together discrete roots and [[morphemes]] with specific meanings, and may also modify words by similar processes.\n* Its basic word order is [[Subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]. However, because the verb is inflected to indicate the subject and sometimes also the object, this order may be changed to emphasise certain parts of the sentence.\n* It has no [[grammatical case]] marking on the noun. Nominal roles are indicated by a combination of word order and agreement markers on the verb, with no change to the nouns themselves.\n* It has a complex [[grammatical gender]] system, but as this does not include a distinction based on natural sex, the term \"noun class\" is generally used instead of \"gender\".\n* It has [[head-first]] order with few exceptions.\n* It is a [[pro-drop language]]. Verbs may be used without explicitly specifying the subject or the object with substantives (nouns or pronouns).\n\n==Nouns==\n===Noun classes===\nSwahili [[noun]]s are grouped into '''[[noun class]]es''' based on the [[prefix]] they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns ''[[wikt:msichana#Swahili|wasichana]]'' \"girls\" and ''[[wikt:msimamizi#Swahili|wasimamizi]]'' \"overseers\" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix ''wa-'', whereas ''[[wikt:kifuniko#Swahili|kifuniko]]'' \"lid, cover\" and ''[[wikt:kisukari#Swahili|kisukari]]'' \"diabetes\" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix ''ki-''. The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] for [[Proto-Bantu]], and have corresponding classes in the other [[Bantu languages]] which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12 and 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties).\n\nWhen discussing Swahili noun classes, it is important to distinguish between (1) ''morphological'' noun classes as a quality of the noun themselves indicated by morphological features (generally prefixes), and (2) ''syntactic'' noun classes as an agreement (i.e. concord) paradigm affecting the use of other words in the sentence. Here, \"noun class\" is used with the former meaning. Morphological and syntactic noun classes often diverge, especially when it comes to nouns referring to people and animals which do not belong to the morphological noun class 1/2, signalled by ''m-wa.'' For more information, see [[Swahili grammar#Concord|concord]].\n\nThe following noun classes exist:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Prefix before consonant\n! Prefix before vowel\n!

The ''mw-'' before a vowel, however, is not syllabic, as in ''mwalimu'' \"teacher\" [mw\u0251.\u02c8li(\u02d0).mu]. When the stem is only one syllable, the prefix takes the stress, as in ''mtu'' \"person\" [\u02c8m\u0329.tu]. Before a stem beginning with ''u'', the prefix may appear as either ''mw-'' or ''mu-'', as in ''mwuguzi'' / ''muuguzi'' \"nurse\". A few nouns, mostly loans, have ''mu-'' before a consonant, such as ''muziki'' \"music\", ''musuli'' \"muscle\" and ''muda'' \"length of time\" (although ''mziki'', ''msuli'' and ''mda'' are also widespread variations). In class 3, the ''w'' is frequently absent before ''o'' as in ''moyo'' \"heart\" (plural: ''mioyo''), ''moto'' \"fire\" (plural: ''mioto'') and ''moshi'' \"smoke\".\n# ''Wa-'' is often present only as ''w-'' when the stem begins with /a/ as in ''[[wikt:wanafunzi#Swahili|'''w'''anafunzi]]'' \"students\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwanafunzi#Swahili|'''mw'''anafunzi]]''). A following ''i'' may merge with the ''a'' of this prefix, forming ''we-'' as in ''[[wikt:wezi#Swahili|'''we'''zi]]'' \"thieves\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwizi#Swahili|'''mw'''izi]]''). The ''a'' in this prefix is generally preserved in nouns which are derived from verbs, such as ''[[wikt:waandishi#Swahili|'''wa'''andishi]]'' \"writer\" (singular: ''[[wikt:mwandishi#Swahili|'''mw'''andishi]]'', from the verb ''[[wikt:andika#Swahili|-andika]]'' \"to write\"), as well as those derived from proper nouns, such as ''[[wikt:Waafrika#Swahili|'''Wa'''afrika]]'' \"Africans\" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwafrika#Swahili|'''Mw'''afrika]]'') and ''[[wikt:Waislamu#Swahili|'''Wa'''islamu]]'' \"Muslims\" (singular: ''[[wikt:Mwislamu#Swahili|'''Mw'''islamu]]'')\n# The ''ji-'' prefix occurs on nouns with monosyllabic stems, such as ''[[wikt:jiwe#Swahili|'''ji'''we]]'' \"stone\" (plural: ''[[wikt:mawe#Swahili|'''ma'''we]]''), but is absent from longer words. This is not to be confused with the augmentative prefix ''ji-'', which is not dropped in the plural, for example ''[[wikt:jiji#Swahili|jiji]]'' \"large town, city\" (plural: ''[[wikt:majiji#Swahili|'''ma'''jiji]]'', from ''[[wikt:mji#Swahili|'''m'''ji]]'' \"town\"). Some nouns may also simply have stems which start with ''ji-'' such as ''[[wiktionary:jina#Swahili|jina]]'' \"name\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:majina#Swahili|'''ma'''jina]]''). Some words whose stems begin with a vowel take the prefix ''j-'', such as ''[[wiktionary:jambo#Swahili|jambo]]'' \"thing, affair\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:mambo#Swahili|'''m'''ambo]]'') but others do not, such as ''[[wiktionary:azimio#Swahili|azimio]]'' \"resolution\" (plural: ''[[wiktionary:maazimio#Swahili|'''ma'''azimio]]'').\n# The prefix ''ma-'' may merge with a following ''i'' to become ''me-'' as in ''[[wikt:meno#Swahili|'''me'''no]]'' \"teeth\" (singular: ''[[wikt:jino#Swahili|'''j'''ino]]'').\n# The prefixes ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' may sometimes appear before vowels, such as in ''[[wikt:kiazi#Swahili|'''ki'''azi]]'' \"potato\" (plural: ''[[wikt:viazi#Swahili|'''vi'''azi]]'') rather than the possibly expected *''chazi'' and *''vyazi''. It is possible to regard the stem of these words as beginning with the ''i'' (e.g. ''-iazi'') as adjectives beginning with ''i'' simply take ''k-'' and ''v-'' prefixes in these classes.\n# The ''n'' of the prefix is a prenasalising [[Consonant mutation|mutation]] of the following consonant and is never syllabic unless the noun would otherwise only have one syllable. It becomes ''m'' before ''b'' and ''v''. In stems beginning with ''w'' such as ''[[wikt:mbili#Swahili|-wili]]'' \"two\", this mutates to ''mb''. Before vowels it is present as ''ny''. Before ''d'', ''z'', ''j'' and ''g'' it is ''n''. ''L'' and ''r'' become ''nd''. Before other consonants, it disappears unless it needs to be syllabic to prevent the noun from having only one syllable, such as in ''[[wikt:nchi#Swahili|'''n'''chi]]'' \"country, land\". The plural form of class 11 nouns is formed this way, dropping the ''u-'' and then applying these rules (for example ''ulimi'' \u2192 ''ndimi'' \"tongue\" \u2192 \"tongues\", ''ukuta'' \u2192 ''kuta'' \"wall\" \u2192 \"walls\"), except that short nouns with a monosyllabic stem preserve the ''u-'' in the plural for reasons of stress, adding ''ny-'' before it to form the plural, such as ''[[wikt:uso#Swahili|'''u'''so]]'' \"face\", which becomes ''[[wikt:nyuso#Swahili|'''ny'''uso]]'' in the plural.\n# The ''u-'' prefix has some variation in spelling and pronunciation before vowels.\n# The ''ku-'' prefix becomes ''kw-'' only before a minority of stems: ''[[wikt:enda#Swahili|'''kw'''enda]]'' \"to go\" and ''[[wikt:isha#Swahili|'''kw'''isha]]'' \"to finish\".\n# The locative classes of nouns no longer have their original ''pa-'', ''ku-'', ''m(u)-''prefixes in Swahili, with these only appearing on adjectives, demonstratives and other parts of the grammar. Most nouns form their locative form by adding the suffix ''-ni'' although this cannot be added to geographical place names, many recent loans and certain other words.\n\nEvery class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 ''mtu'' \"person\" is class 2 ''watu'' \"people\". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example ''ugonjwa'' \"sickness, disease\", ''magonjwa'' \"diseases\". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as ''maji'' \"water\", and other nouns derived from verbs such as ''mazungumzo'' \"conversation(s)\". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as ''mchana'' \"afternoon(s)\", \"daytime\" (class 3), ''vita'' \"war(s)\" (class 8), ''usiku'' \"night(s)\" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.\n\nIn terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including [[agent noun]]s, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. [[Abstract noun]]s are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.\n\n=== Concord ===\nThe class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement or concord]]. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed \"concords\" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 1/2:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Mwanaume mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Wanaume wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''mw'''anaume\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''w'''anaume\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL1)'''man\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL2)'''men\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"man\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"men\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big man fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big men fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 7/8:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Kitabu kikubwa kilianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Vitabu vikubwa vilianguka.''\n|-\n|'''ki'''tabu\n|'''ki'''-kubwa\n|'''ki'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''vi'''tabu\n|'''vi'''-kubwa\n|'''vi'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL7)'''book\n|'''CL7'''-big\n|'''CL7'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL8)'''books\n|'''CL8'''-big\n|'''CL8'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"book\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"books\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big book fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big books fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 11/10:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Uso mzuri unatosha.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Nyuso nzuri zinatosha.''\n|-\n|'''u'''so\n|'''m'''-zuri\n|'''u'''-na-tosh(a)\n|'''ny'''uso\n|'''n'''-zuri\n|'''zi'''-na-tosh(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL11)'''face\n|'''CL11'''-beautiful\n|'''CL11'''-PRES-be.enough\n|'''(CL10)'''faces\n|'''CL10'''-beautiful\n|'''CL10'''-PRES-be.enough\n|-\n|<small>\"face\"</small>\n|<small>\"beautiful\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-is-enough\"</small>\n|<small>\"faces\"</small>\n|<small>\"beautiful\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-are-enough\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"A beautiful face is enough.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Beautiful faces are enough.\"\n|}\n\n[[animacy|Animate nouns]] (i.e. those referring to people or animals) which are not in classes 1/2 generally take the agreement prefixes (concords) from classes 1/2 as if they did belong to it.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 7/8 Animate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Kifaru mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Vifaru wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''ki'''faru\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''vi'''faru\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL7)'''rhinoceros\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL8)'''rhinoceroses\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"rhinoceros\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"rhinoceroses\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big rhinoceros fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big rhinoceroses fell.\"\n|}\n\nAnimacy agreements can often distinguish different meanings of the same noun, such as ''ndege'', which means \"bird(s)\" when animate and \"aeroplane(s)\" when inanimate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 9/10 Animate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege mkubwa alianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege wakubwa walianguka.''\n|-\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''m'''-kubwa\n|'''a'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''wa'''-kubwa\n|'''wa'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL9)'''bird\n|'''CL1'''-big\n|'''CL1'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL10)'''birds\n|'''CL2'''-big\n|'''CL2'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"bird\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"birds\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big bird fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big birds fell.\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"7\" |Class 9/10 Inanimate:\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege kubwa ilianguka.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ndege kubwa zilianguka.''\n|-\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''N'''-kubwa\n|'''i'''-li-anguk(a)\n|'''n'''dege\n|'''N'''-kubwa\n|'''zi'''-li-anguk(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL9)'''bird\n|'''CL9'''-big\n|'''CL9'''-PST-fall\n|'''(CL10)'''birds\n|'''CL10'''-big\n|'''CL10'''-PST-fall\n|-\n|<small>\"bird\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"it-fell\"</small>\n|<small>\"birds\"</small>\n|<small>\"big\"</small>\n|<small>\"they-fell\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big plane fell.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The big planes fell.\"\n|}\n\nAnimate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight aberration from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms ''-angu'', ''-ako'', ''-ake'', ''-etu'', ''-enu'' and ''-ao'' are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving ''yangu'', ''yako'', ''yetu'' etc. in singular and ''zangu'', ''zako'', ''zetu'' etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition ''-a'' (giving ''ya'' in singular and ''za'' in plural), however for most speakers ''wa'' is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class.

The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as \"in\", \"at\", \"on\", \"to\" or \"from\", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.\n\nThe Arabic loan noun ''mahali'' \"place\" (and its variations: ''pahali'', ''mahala'' and ''pahala'') is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix ''-ni'' to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.\n\nBecause locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on ''pa-'' and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on ''ku-'' indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on ''mu-'' and indicates internal location.\n\n* ''nyumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''y'''a]] Rehema'' \"Rehema's house\" (class 9)\n* ''nyumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''kw'''a]] Rehema'' \"at/to/from Rehema's house\" (class 17)\n* ''chumba [[#Genitive_-a|'''ch'''a]] Daudi'' \"Daudi's room\" (class 7)\n* ''chumba'''ni''' [[#Genitive_-a|'''mw'''a]] Daudi'' \"in/into/out of Daudi's room\" (class 18)\n\n=== Apposition and compounding ===\nThe equivalent of compound words is usually formed using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive construction]] such as ''mpira '''wa''' kikapu'' \"basketball\" (literally \"''ball '''of''' basket''\"). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French ''fin '''de''' semaine'' \"weekend\" (literally \"''end '''of''' week''\").\n\nThere are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition ''-a''. In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side.\n\nThe word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes ''what'' it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun ''punda'' \"donkey(s)\" is followed by the class 4 noun ''milia'' \"stripes\" to mean \"zebra\". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: \"stripe-donkey\", the word for \"donkey\" appears first in Swahili.\n\nThere is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for \"zebra(s)\" may appear as any of ''pundamilia'', ''punda-milia'' or ''punda milia''.\n\nA few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ke'' \"woman\" becomes '''''w'''ana'''wa'''ke'' \"women\" in plural. Similarly, '''''mw'''ana'''m'''ume'' \"man\" becomes '''''w'''anaume'' \"men\" in plural, although the singular form '''''mw'''anaume'' is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word ''mwana'' \"son, daughter\", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean \"person\", followed by the words ''mke'' \"wife\" (plural: ''wake'') and ''mume'' \"husband\" (plural: ''waume'') respectively.\n\n==Pronouns==\n\nPronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between ''we'' and ''us'', which are both ''sisi''.\n\n===Personal pronouns===\n\nPersonal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as ''na'' \"with, and\" and ''ndi-'' \"it is\". The independent form consists, in all cases except for ''wao'', of a reduplication of a syllable. ''Nyinyi'', however, may alternatively be dissimilated to ''ninyi''.  These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Independent\n! Combining\nsuffix\n! Genitive<br/>suffix\n!\"all\"\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n| ''mimi''\n| ''-mi''\n| ''-angu''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n| ''wewe''\n| ''-we''\n| ''-ako''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 3rd sing.\n| ''yeye''\n| ''-ye''\n| ''-ake''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n| ''sisi''\n| ''-si''\n| ''-etu''\n|''(sisi) sote''\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n| ''nyinyi, ninyi''\n| ''-nyi''\n| ''-enu''\n|''(nyinyi) nyote''\n|-\n! 3rd plur.\n| ''wao''\n| ''-o''\n| ''-ao''\n|''(wao) wote''\n|}\n\nNote that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with ''yeye'' capable of meaning either \"he\" or \"she\". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean ''it''. The genitive form ''-ake'' has no such restriction and may mean \"his\", \"hers\" or \"its\" depending on context.\n\nSwahili is a [[pro-drop]] language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula ''ni'' (or its negative counterpart ''si'') is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.\n\nIn informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as ''mi'' or ''mie'' for ''mimi''. This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. ''mi ni'' \"I am\", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix ''ni-'' is dropped in casual speech before ''-na-''. For example, standard ''(mimi) ninajua'' \"I know\" often occurs as (''mi) najua'' in spoken Swahili.\n\n== Determiners ==\n[[Determiner]]s in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs.\n\n===Articles===\nThere are no articles in Swahili. A word such as ''kitabu'' \"book\" may be taken to mean either \"the book\" or \"a book\" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as ''kitabu hicho'' \"that (aforementioned) book\", ''kitabu kimoja'' \"one book\", ''kitabu fulani'' \"some (particular) book\", ''kitabu chochote'' \"any book (at all)\".\n\n===Demonstrative===\n\nThe demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types:\n* Proximal (\"this, these\"), referring to something near the speaker. It is formed by prefixing the verbal concord with ''hV-'' where \"V\" stands for a vowel identical to the vowel of the next syllable.\n* Distal (\"that, those\"), referring to something far from both speaker and listener. It is formed by suffixing ''-le'' to the verbal concord.\n* Medial/Referential (\"the aforementioned\"), referring to something that has been previously mentioned. It may also refer to something nearer to the listener than the speaker. It is formed by replacing the final vowel of the proximal demonstrative with the ''o'' (with consonant changes such as ''ki'' becoming ''ch'' etc.).\n\nThere is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as ''na'' and ''ndi-''. This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! Proximal\n! Distal\n!

The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article-like role.\n\n=== Other determiners ===\nThe words ''-ote'' \"all\", ''-o-ote'' \"any\", ''-pi'' \"which\" and ''-enyewe'' \"-self\", \"-selves\"'','' appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, ''-o-ote'' was frequently written as two words (e.g. ''ye yote'', ''vyo vyote'') however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions ''-a'' and ''-enye'' as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"4\" |Determiners\n! colspan=\"2\" |<small>Prepositions</small>\n!<small>Verbal Prefix</small>\n|-\n!

These may be used with or without the pronoun: ''sisi sote'' or simply ''sote'' can mean \"all of us\", \"we all\". When used with the form ''wote'', the meaning is \"both\": ''sisi wote'' \"both of us\", \"we both\".\n# The irregular form ''wepi'' is used to avoid clashes with the word ''wapi'' meaning \"where\".\n# The word ''vipi'' may be used to ask \"which\" of class 8 nouns (e.g. ''vitabu vipi?'' \"which books?\"), but, as is typical for class 8, can also be understood adverbially, following a verb to mean \"how?\".\n# The usual word for \"where\" or \"which place\" is ''wapi'', however some sources list a regular form ''papi''.\n\n==Adjectives==\n\nThe term \"adjective\", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as \"true adjectives\" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: ''inflecting adjectives'', which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and ''invariable adjectives'', which do not take a prefix.\n\nAll adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:\n* Inflecting adjectives are true adjectives which are prefixed with an adjective concord.\n* Plain adjectives are true adjectives which do not take concord prefixes.\n* Relatives are relativised verbs which can be used as adjectives.\n* Genitives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the genitive preposition ''-a''.\n* Ornatives are phrases consisting of a noun introduced by the ornative preposition ''-enye''.\n\n===Inflecting Adjectives===\n\nInflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal ''u-'' prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival ''m-'' prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.\n\nMost inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either ''e'' (for example, ''-ekundu'' \"red\") or ''i'' (e.g. ''-ingi'' \"many, much\"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: ''-ovu'' \"evil, wicked\", which is '''''mw'''ovu'' in class 1 and '''''wa'''ovu'' in class 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Nominally prefixed\n|-\n!

On adjectives with stems of more than one syllable, it only appears as a prenasalisation of the following consonants: ''b'' \u2192 '''mb''', ''d'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''g'' \u2192 '''ng''', ''j'' \u2192 '''nj''', ''l'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''r'' \u2192 '''nd''', ''v'' \u2192 '''mv''', ''w'' \u2192 '''mb''', ''z'' \u2192 '''nz'''. Elsewhere, it disappears. In addition, the monosyllabic adjective stem ''-pya'' \"new\" has the form ''mpya'', whereby the ''m-'' constitutes the stressed syllable.\n# The adjective ''-ema'' \"good, kind, nice\" has the irregular form ''njema'' in class 9 and 10 instead of the expected form ''*nyema''.\n# In modern standard Swahili, adjectives in class 14 take the prefix ''m(w)-'', however, in an earlier stage of the language, they took the prefix ''u-/w-'' which is still preserved in some idiomatic phrases but has otherwise disappeared, marking the almost complete merge of classes 11 and 14.\nThe adjective ''-ingine'' \"other\", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms '''''lingine''''' in class six, '''''ingine''''' or '''''yingine''''' in class 9 and '''''zingine''''' in class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes:'' '''jengine''', '''lengine''', '''nyengine''', '''yengine''''' and'' '''zengine''''' sometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are '''''jingine''''' for class 6 and '''''nyingine''''' for classes 9 and 10.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gromova|first=Nelly|title=MASWALI MACHACHE YA USANIFISHAJI WA KISWAHILI (JINGINE AU LINGINE?)|url=http://www.qucosa.de/fileadmin/data/qucosa/documents/9466/15_09_Gromova.pdf|journal=Swahili Forum|volume=15 |year=2008|pages=115\u2013120|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Swahili grammar and workbook|last=Fid\u00e8le|first=Mpiranya|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781315750699|location=London|pages=37|oclc=878224907}}</ref>\n\nThe numerals ''-moja'' \"one\", ''-wili'' \"two\", ''-tatu'' \"three\", ''-nne'' \"four\", ''-tano'' \"five\" and ''-nane'' \"eight\", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. \n* ''mtu '''m'''moja'' \"one person\", ''watu '''wa'''wili'' \"two people\", ''watu ishirini na '''m'''moja'' \"twenty-one people\", ''watu ishirini na '''wa'''wili'' \"twenty-two people\"\n* ''kitabu '''ki'''moja'' \"one book\", ''vitabu '''vi'''wili'' \"two books\", ''vitabu ishirini na '''ki'''moja'' \"twenty-one books\", ''vitabu ishirini na '''vi'''wili'' \"twenty-two books\"\n* ''nyumba moja'' \"one house\", ''nyumba '''mb'''ili'' \"two houses\", ''nyumba ishirini na moja'' \"twenty-one houses\", ''nyumba ishirini na '''mb'''ili'' \"twenty-two houses\"\n\n=== Invariable adjectives ===\nInvariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as ''safi'' \"clean\", ''ghali'' \"expensive\", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as ''faini'', from English \"fine\". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as ''msichana kiziwi'' \"Deaf girl\", which has a class 1 prefix ''m-'' and a class 7 prefix ''ki-''. Numbers loaned from Arabic: ''sita'' \"six\", ''saba'' \"seven\" and ''tisa'' \"nine\", ''ishirini'' \"twenty\", etc., as well as the native Bantu number ''kumi'' \"ten\", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective ''gani'' \"what kind of\" or, colloquially, \"which\" is also invariable.\n* ''watu tisa'' \"nine people\"\n* ''vitabu tisa'' \"nine books\"\n* ''nyumba tisa'' \"nine houses\"\n\n===Relatives===\n\nRelatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives \"open\" and \"dead\", however the verbs ''kufa'' \"to die\" and ''kufunguliwa'' \"to be opened\", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use:\n* ''ndege aliyekufa'' \"dead bird\" (bird which died)\n* ''ndege waliokufa'' \"dead birds\" (birds which died)\n* ''mlango uliofunguliwa'' \"open door\" (door which was opened)\n* ''milango iliyofunguliwa'' \"open doors\" (doors which were opened)\n* ''dirisha lililofunguliwa'' \"open window\" (window which was opened)\n* ''madirisha yaliyofunguliwa'' \"open windows\" (windows which were opened)\n\n===Genitive adjectives===\nAnother construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the [[#Genitive_-a|genitive preposition ''-a'']]. The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined [[#Genitive_-a|here]].\n\nIn many cases, the noun introduced in a genitive adjective phrase receives an additional ''ki-'' prefix, such as ''-a kimataifa'' \"international\" (from ''mataifa'' \"nations\") and ''-a kihistoria'' \"historic\" (from ''historia'' \"history\").\n\n===Ornative construction===\nYet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the [[Ornative case|ornative]] construction using ''-enye''. Some examples of adjectival phrases with ''-enye'' include ''-enye nguvu'' \"strong\" (with strength), ''-enye nywele fupi'' \"short-haired\" (having short hair), and ''-enye senta moja'' \"concentric\" (having one centre). The forms of ''-enye'' as well as some more examples of use can be seen [[#Ornative_-enye|here]].\n\n==Verbs==\nLike nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|tense, aspect, mood]] and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as ''-sema'' \"say\", ''-andika'' \"to write\", ''-la'' \"to eat\". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with ''ku-'' or, for a couple of verbs only, ''kw-'', such as ''kusema'' \"to say\", ''kuandika'' \"to write\", ''kula'' \"to eat\".\n\n===Overview of verb structure===\n\nPrefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE.\n\n* '''S'''ubject prefix\n* [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|'''T'''AM]] prefix (or usually '''T'''ense prefix)\n* '''R'''elative prefix\n* '''O'''bject prefix\n* '''V'''erb stem \n* '''E'''xtension(s) (meaning \"derivative suffix(es)\"), or, more broadly '''E'''nding (including also the inflectional suffixes ''-i'' and ''-e'').\n\nIn learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as [[infix]]es. It should, however, be noted that the term ''infix'', as used by linguists, refers only to a [[morpheme]] (\u2248 part of a word) that is inserted ''within'' another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes.\n\nHere is an example of a verb with all slots filled:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"6\" |''nilipokupikia''\n|-\n!S\n!T\n!R\n!O\n!V\n!E\n|-\n|''ni-''\n|''-li-''\n|''-po-''\n|''-ku-''\n|''-pik(a)*''\n|''-i(a)*''\n|-\n|1S-\n| -PST-\n| -CL16.REL-\n| -2S-\n| -cook\n| -APPL\n|-\n|<small>\"I\"</small>\n|<small>\"earlier\"</small>\n|<small>\"when\"</small>\n|<small>\"you\"</small>\n|<small>\"cook\"</small>\n|<small>\"for\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |\"when I cooked for you\"\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This \"(a)\" appears when this is the final element of the word and is otherwise dropped.\n\nMost of the time, verbs will not have all slots filled.

In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with ''-a''. All verbs of native Bantu origin end with ''-a'', including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are ''kuanguka'' \"to fall\", ''kufanya'' \"to do, to make\", ''kuona'' \"to see\", ''kuwaza'' \"to think\", ''kusaidia'' \"to help\". The final ''-a'' is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming ''-i'' in the present negative, and ''-e'' in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker ''-ni'' also triggers this final ''-a'' to become ''-e.''\n\n'''Short verbs''' are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as  ''kula'' \"to eat\", ''kunywa'' \"to drink\", ''kuja'' \"to come\", ''kupa'' \"to give\". The verbs ''kwenda'' \"to go\" and ''kwisha'' \"to finish\" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as ''kuenda'' and ''kuisha''). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix ''ku-'' is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed '''monosyllabic verbs''', however this is problematic as the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as ''-p-'' \"give\"). Furthermore, when the final ''-a'' is considered part of the stem, this excludes ''-enda'' and ''-isha'', which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in ''-a'' and undergo the same ''-i'' and ''-e'' alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable ''-ku-'' in certain verb forms. This intrusive ''-ku-''  (which may be [[Interlinear gloss|glossed]] as <small>EXT</small> for \"extension\") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|TAM]] prefixes (-''na-'', ''-me-'', ''-li-'', ''-ta-'', ''-sha-'', ''-nge-'', ''-ngeli-'') and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This ''-ku-'' disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes (''-a-'', ''hu-'', ''-ki-'', ''-ka-'', ''-ku-'', ''-si-''). (The TAM prefix ''-ja-'' can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of ''-enda'' and ''-isha'' takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their ''-kw-'' extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the ''-ku-'' extension in other short verbs.\n\nThe '''Loan verbs''', also frequently called '''\"Arabic\" verbs''',  are those which do not end in ''-a'' in the infinitive. Not all verbs, from Arabic are in this group, however, such as ''kusaidia'', which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in ''-a'' and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as ''kukisi'' \"to kiss\" and ''kuripoti'' \"to report\", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in ''-a''. The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes ''-e'' and ''-i'' that the verbs ending in ''-a'' do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in ''si-ku-sahau-<s>\u00d8</s>'' which could either mean \"I did not forget\" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST-forget-<s>\u00d8</s>) or \"I do not forget you\" (NEG.1s-2s-forget-<s>PRES.NEG</s>).\n\n===Subject and object concords===\n\nBoth the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by ''prefixes'' or ''concords'' attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a [[pro-drop]] language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.\n\nSix different forms of verbal concord exist.\n\nFor the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable ''ha-'' to the beginning, except for the irregular forms ''si-'' (instead of ''*hani-''), ''hu-'' (instead of ''*hau-'') and ''ha-'' (instead of ''*haa-'') which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.\n\nAdditionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix ''yu-'' is used instead of ''a-'' as the subject of a locative copula. (This ''yu-'' can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of ''yu-'' is formed regularly, by appending the prefix ''ha-''.\n\nBefore the present 'indefinite' marker ''-a-'', subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition ''-a''.\n\nObject concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!\n! colspan=\"4\" |Positive\n! colspan=\"2\" |Negative\n|-\n!

Very frequently, however, the suffix ''-eni'' is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: ''nina'''wa'''on'''eni''''' \"I see you all.\"  This suffix causes the final ''a'' of Bantu verbs to shift to ''e''. On loan verbs, this suffix is simply ''-ni''. Some speakers use the prefix ''-ku-'' (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix ''-(e)ni'', as in ''nina'''ku'''on'''eni''''' \"I see you all.\"\n\nThe reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like ''myself'', ''yourself'', ''himself'' and so on.\n* '''''ni'''na'''ji'''tetea'' \"I defend myself\"\n* '''''a'''na'''ji'''ona'' \"he sees himself\" (idiomatically, may mean: \"he is conceited\")\n\n===Infinitive===\n\nThe infinitive is a [[verbal noun]], and belongs to the nominal class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix '''''ku-'''''. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix ''-ni'', as in ''kuangukani'' \"in falling\" (i.e. \"while falling\"). It corresponds to the English [[Infinitive#English|infinitive]] or [[Gerund#Gerunds in English|gerund]].

All together, [[Tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|Tense, Aspect and Mood]] may be abbreviated as TAM.\n\nThe following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for \"short\" and \"common verbs\", with \"loan verbs\" remaining invariable here with the exception of the ''-ni'' suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this ''-(e)ni'' prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nSummary of TAM forms\n!\n!Tense, Aspect,\n\nMood\n!Subject\n!TAM\n!Relative\n!Object\n/ Extension\n!Verb\nSTEM\n!Final Vowel\n!2P\n!Relative\n|-\n| rowspan=\"10\" |Indicative\nBasic\n\nTenses\n|[[#Past|Past]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''li'''-\n|(REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Past|Past Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ku'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Perfect|Perfect]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''me'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Perfect|Perfect Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ja'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / (EXT)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present 'Definite']]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''na'''-\n|(REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present 'Indefinite']]\n|<u>SUB*</u>\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Habitual|Present Habitual]]\n|''&mdash;''\n|'''hu'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''i'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future]]\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ta'''-\n|(-'''ka'''-REL)\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future Negative]]\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''ta'''- / -'''to'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Relative\nForms\n|Tenseless Relative\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|REL\n|-\n|Tenseless Negative Relative\n|SUB\n| -'''si'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Contextual\nTenses\n|Situational\n|SUB\n| -'''ki'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Consecutive\n|SUB\n| -'''ka'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"6\" |Irrealis\n|Irrealis Present\n|SUB\n| -'''nge'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Present Negative 1\n|SUB\n| -'''singe'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Present Negative 2\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n| -'''nge'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past\n|SUB\n| -'''ngali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past Negative 1\n|SUB\n| -'''singali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Irrealis Past Negative 2\n|<u>NEG</u>.SUB\n| -'''ngali'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Imperatives\nand\n\nSubjunctives\n|Imperative Singular (- OBJ)\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;'' / EXT\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Imperative Singular + OBJ\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|OBJ\n|STEM\n| -'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Imperative Plural\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''e'''-\n| -'''ni'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Subjunctive\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Subjunctive Negative\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''si'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Expeditive\nImperatives\n\nand\n\nSubjunctives\n|Expeditive Subjunctive\n|SUB\n| -'''ka'''-\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''e'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|Exp.

It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive ''ji-'') causes the final ''-a'' of Bantu verbs to become ''-e''. Note that the ''ji-'' prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of ''-jifunza'' \"to learn\" is ''jifunz<u>e</u>'' \"learn!\" and not ''*jifunza''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the imperative\n|\n!Common verbs\n!Short verbs\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Singular\n|___'''''a'''''\n|'''''ku'''''___'''''a'''''\n|___\n|-\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Plural\n|___'''''eni'''''\n|'''''ku'''''___'''''eni'''''\n|___'''''ni'''''\n|-\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''eni'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''eni'''''\n|[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''ni'''''\n|}\n\nThe plural form, with the suffix ''-ni'', is used when addressing multiple people.\n\nThe following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:\n* ''kuja'' \"to come\": '''''njoo''''' (pl. '''''njooni''''')\n* ''kwenda'' \"to go\" : '''''nenda''''' (pl. '''''nendeni''''')\n* ''kuleta'' \"to bring\": '''''lete''''' (pl.

'''''iweni'''''), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form '''''kuwa''''' (pl.

These are sometimes termed the \"definite present\" (with '''''-na-''''') and the \"indefinite present\" (with '''''-a-'''''). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the \"indefinite present\" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=Dorothee|date=|title=SWAHILI AS A TENSE PROMINENT LANGUAGE.

This is outlined [[#Subject and object concords|above]].\n\nIn informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord ''ni-'' to collapse into the '''''-na-''''' of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the \"definite\" and \"indefinite\" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a ''na-'', however short verbs retain their ''-ku-'' extension in the ''-na-'' tense and lose it in the ''-a-'' tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in ''(ni)nakula'' \"I eat\", in the ''-na-'' present tense, versus ''nala'' \"I eat\", in the ''-a-'' present tense.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples (\"definite\", \"indefinite, negative)\n|-\n!

Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Ng'ombe hula nyasi.''\n|-\n|ng'ombe\n|'''hu'''-l(a)\n|nyasi\n|-\n|head(s).of.cattle(CL9/10)\n|'''HAB'''-eat\n|grass(CL10)\n|-\n|<small>\"cow(s)\"</small>\n|<small>\"eat(s), '''as a rule'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"grass\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Cows eat grass.\" / \"A cow eats grass.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |''Sisi hunywa bia kila wikendi.''\n|-\n|sisi\n|'''hu'''-nyw(a)\n|bia\n|kila\n|wikendi\n|-\n|1P\n|'''HAB'''-drink\n|beer(CL9/10)\n|every\n|weekend(CL9)\n|-\n|<small>\"we\"</small>\n|<small>\"drink(s), '''as a rule'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"beer\"</small>\n|<small>\"every\"</small>\n|<small>\"weekend\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"We drink beer every weekend.\"\n|}\nThe habitual aspect with ''hu-'' is often replaced by the present with ''-na-'' in everyday use, the ''sisi hunywa'' of the above example then being replaced with ''tunakunywa.'' Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix '''''-ga''''' or '''''-nga''''' which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving ''tunakunywaga'' or ''tunakunywanga''. The habitual aspect with ''hu-'' is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |'''''Haba na haba hujaza kibaba.'''''\n|-\n|haba\n|na\n|haba\n|'''hu'''-ja(a)-z(a)\n|kibaba\n|-\n|insignificant\n|COM\n|insignificant\n|'''HAB'''-become.full-CAUS\n|1.56.litre.container(CL7)\n|-\n|<small>\"little\"</small>\n|<small>\"and\"</small>\n|<small>\"little\"</small>\n|<small>\"fills, '''as a rule'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"container\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"Little by little, a cup is filled.\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |(Roughly equivalent to \"Slow and steady wins the race,\" or \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\")\n|}\n\n====Past====\n\nThe past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix ''-li-''. Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus ''-ku-''. The positive tense marker ''-li-'' cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension ''-ku-'' (or ''-kw-'') where necessary.  The negative tense marker ''-ku-'' can take stress, meaning that an additional ''-ku-'' extension is not needed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the past tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive past\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''liku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''li'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative past\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ku'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

For example, the word ''nimepika'' \"I have cooked\" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas ''nilipika'' \"I cooked\" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).\n\nThe perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix '''''-me-'''''. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus '''''-ja-'''''. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker '''''-me-''''' cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs, but the negative marker '''''-ja-''''' is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension ''-ku-'' with '''''-ja-'''''.\n\nSome sources describe the '''''-ja-''''' form as containing more of an implication of \"not yet\" than a simple negation of the '''''-me''-''' form, however the word ''bado'' \"still\", \"not yet\" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the perfect tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive perfect\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''meku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''me'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative perfect\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja(ku)___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ja'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

Compare for example: ''ni'''na'''choka'' \"I am becoming tired\"; ''ni'''me'''choka'' \"I have become tired\", i.e. \"I am tired.\" For more information and examples, see [[#Inchoative_verbs|the section on inchoative verbs below]].\n\nSome speakers may replace the sequence of prefixes '''''a-me-''''' with '''''ka-''''' with more or less the same meaning. This may derive from the consecutive tense marker.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Swahili grammar and workbook|last=Mpiranya|first=Fid\u00e8le|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9781315750699|location=London|pages=44|oclc=878224907}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Paka wangu amepotea.''\n| rowspan=\"5\" |\u2194\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Paka wangu kapotea.''\n|-\n|paka\n|'''w'''-angu\n|'''a'''-'''me'''-pote(a)\n|paka\n|'''w'''-angu\n|'''ka'''-pote(a)\n|-\n|'''(CL9)'''cat(s)\n|'''CL1'''-GEN.1S\n|'''CL1'''-'''PRF'''-get.lost\n|'''(CL9)'''cat(s)\n|'''CL1'''-GEN.1S\n|'''CL1.PRF'''-get.lost\n|-\n|<small>\"cat\"</small>\n|<small>\"my\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-has-gotten-lost\"</small>\n|<small>\"cat\"</small>\n|<small>\"my\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he-has-gotten-lost\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"My cat is lost.\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"My cat is lost.\"\n|}\n\n*\n\n==== Anterior ''-sha-'' ====\nThe '''anterior''' marker '''''-sha-''''' (or sometimes '''''-kwisha-''''') is a relatively new TAM marker that derives diachronically from the verb '''''kwisha''''' \"to finish, to run out\". It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker '''''-me-'''''. It often imparts the meaning of \"already\", emphasising the completeness of the action.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Asante, nimeshakula.'''''\n|-\n|asante\n|ni-me-'''sha'''-ku-l(a)\n|-\n|thank.you\n|1S-PRF-'''ANT'''-EXT-eat\n|-\n|<small>\"thank you\"</small>\n|<small>\"I have '''already''' eaten\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"No thank you, I have already eaten.\"\n|}\nThe anterior marker '''''-sha-''''' is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect ''-me-''. These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker ''-ki-'' where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |'''''Ukishapata kazi, utakuwa na pesa za kutosha.'''''\n|-\n|u-ki-sha-pat(a)\n|kazi\n|u-ta-ku-w(a)\n|na\n|pesa\n|z-a\n|ku-tosh(a)\n|-\n|2S-SITU-'''ANT'''-get\n|work(CL9)\n|2S-FUT-EXT-be\n|COM\n|money(CL10)\n|CL10-GEN\n|INF(CL15)-suffice\n|-\n|<small>\"'''once''' you get\"</small>\n|<small>\"work\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will be\"</small>\n|<small>\"with\"</small>\n|<small>\"money\"</small>\n|<small>\"of\"</small>\n|<small>\"to suffice\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"Once you get a job, you will have enough money.\"\n|}\n\n====Future====\n\nThe future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix '''''-ta-'''''. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with '''''-ta-''''' being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use '''''-to-''''' in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the ''-to-'' of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an ''h-'' at the beginning of the negative word. For example, ''atakuja'' \"s/he will come\" vs. ''<u>h</u>atakuja'' \"s/he will not come\" (or ''<u>h</u>at<u>o</u>kuja''). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from '''''-ta-''''' to '''''-to-''''' in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.\n\n'''''-Ta-''''' (and likewise '''''-to-''''') cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the ''-ku-'' extension in short verbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the future tense\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive future\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''___'''a'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''taku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative future\n(usual)\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta___a'''''\n| [<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''taku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''ta'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |negative future\n(variant)\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''toku___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___a'''''\n|[<small>NEG.SUBJ</small>]'''''to'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final ''-a'', where present, to ''-e''-. The so-called \"Arabic verbs\" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable ''-si-'' into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the subjunctive\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | positive subjunctive\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>][<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | negative subjunctive\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___e'''''\n| [<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si___'''''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___e'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''si'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]'''''___'''''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Examples\n|-\n!

This prefix may take stress and thus the extension ''-ku-'' does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form.\n\nThere is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using '''''-sipo-''''' is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of '''''-ki-''''' and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the ''-ku-'' extension ''does'' appear with ''-sipo-'' as the ''-po-'', like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Formation of the situational\n|-\n|\n!Common Verb\n!Short Verb\n!Loan verb\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |positive situational\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''ki'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |negative situational\n<small>(conditional only)</small>\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipoku'''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''___''\n|-\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___'''a'''''\n|[<small>SUBJ</small>]'''''sipo'''''[<small>OBJ</small>]''___''\n|}\n\nThe situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions \"if\" and \"when\", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as ''kama'', ''ikiwa'' or ''endapo'' may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word ''ikiwa'' is itself the situational form of the verb ''-wa'' \"to be\", with the class 9 subject prefix ''i-'', literally meaning on its own essentially \"if it is\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |''(Kama) ukitaka kuja, utapaswa kulipa.''\n|-\n|(kama)\n|u-'''ki'''-tak(a)\n|ku-j(a)\n|u-ta-pas(a)-w(a)\n|ku-lip(a)\n|-\n|(if)\n|2S.SBJ-'''SITU'''-want\n|INF(CL15)-come\n|2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS\n|INF(CL15)-pay\n|-\n|<small>(\"if\")</small>\n|<small>\"'''if''' you want\"</small>\n|<small>\"to come\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will be behooved\"</small>\n|<small>\"to pay\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"'''If''' you want to come, you will have to pay.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |''(Kama) usipotaka kuja, hutapaswa kulipa.''\n|-\n|(kama)\n|u-'''si'''-'''po'''-tak(a)\n|ku-j(a)\n|hu-ta-pas(a)-w(a)\n|ku-lip(a)\n|-\n|(if)\n|2S.SBJ-'''NEG'''-'''CL16.REL'''-want\n|INF(CL15)-come\n|NEG.2S.SBJ-FUT-behoove-PASS\n|INF(CL15)-pay\n|-\n|<small>(\"if\")</small>\n|<small>\"'''if''' you '''don't''' want\"</small>\n|<small>\"to come\"</small>\n|<small>\"you will not be behooved\"</small>\n|<small>\"to pay\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" |\"'''If''' you '''don't''' want to come, you will not have to pay.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"8\" |''Wanajeshi wawili walikuja wakikimbia, wote wawili wakibeba upanga.''\n|-\n|wanajeshi\n|wa-wili\n|wa-li-ku-j(a)\n|wa-'''ki'''-kimbia\n|w-ote\n|wa-wili\n|wa-'''ki'''-beb(a)\n|upanga\n|-\n|soldiers(CL2)\n|CL2-two\n|CL2.SBJ-PST-EXT-come\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-run\n|CL2-all\n|CL2-two\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-carry\n|machete(CL11)\n|-\n|<small>\"soldiers\"</small>\n|<small>\"two\"</small>\n|<small>\"they came\"</small>\n|<small>\"(they) runn'''ing'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"all\"</small>\n|<small>\"two\"</small>\n|<small>\"(they) carry'''ing'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"machete\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\" |\"Two soldiers came runn'''ing''', both of them carry'''ing''' a machete.\"\n|}\nThe situational may appear in compound progressive tenses.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\" |''Tulipofika, alikuwa akila kwa pupa haraka iwezekanavyo.''\n|-\n|tu-li-po-fik(a)\n|a-li-ku-w(a)\n|a-'''ki'''-l(a)\n|kwa\n|pupa\n|haraka\n|i-wezekan(a)-vyo\n|-\n|1P.SBJ-PST-CL16.REL-arrive\n|CL1.SBJ-PST-EXT-be\n|CL2.SBJ-'''SITU'''-eat\n|INST\n|greed(CL9)\n|quickly\n|CL9.SBJ-be.possible-CL8.REL\n|-\n|\"when we arrived\"\n|\"he was\"\n|\"(he) eating\"\n|\"with\"\n|\"greed\"\n|\"quickly\"\n|\"as it is possible\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |\"When we arrived, he was ('''in the middle of''') eat'''ing''' greedily as quickly as possible.\"\n|}\n\n==== Consecutive ====\nThe '''consecutive''' or '''narrative''' tense is formed with the TAM prefix '''''-ka-'''''.

Both the [[Protasis (linguistics)|protasis]] (if-clause) and [[Apodosis (linguistics)|apodosis]] (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first.

The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a [[Periphrasis|periphrastic]] relative using ''amba-''.\n\nThe following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled \"REL\". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is ''-taka-'' with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple ''-ta-'' which occurs otherwise.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" |Tense, Aspect,\n\nMood\n!Subject\n!TAM\n!Relative\n!Object\n/ Extension\n!Verb\nSTEM\n!Final Vowel\n!Relative\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Tensed\n|[[#Past|Past]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''li'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Present tenses|Present]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''na'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n|[[#Future|Future]] Positive\n|SUB\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''taka'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ) / EXT\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Tenseless\n|Positive\n|SUB\n|''&mdash;''\n|''&mdash;''\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n|<nowiki>-</nowiki>'''a'''-\n|REL\n|-\n|Negative\n|SUB\n| -'''si'''-\n|REL\n|(OBJ)\n|STEM\n| -'''a'''\n|''&mdash;''\n|}\nThe relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with ''na-'' and ''ndi-''. Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing ''o'' (the so-called \"o of reference\")\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb '''''-wa''''' (infinitive '''''kuwa''''') is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of ''essence'' versus a copula of ''state or location''. This is similar to the distinction between [[Romance copula|''ser'' and ''estar'']] in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique [[Continuative aspect|continuative]] form.\n\n==== Essence ====\n===== Invariable copula =====\nThe invariable copula '''''ni''''' is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]) refer to one and the same referent:\n* ''Mimi '''ni''' Bahati.'' \"I '''am''' Bahati.\"\n* ''Dunia '''ni''' sayari tunapoishi.'' \"Earth '''is''' the planet we live on.\"\nIt is also used to express membership of a class (a [[subset]] relationship):\n* ''Wao '''ni''' wanasayansi.'' \"They '''are''' scientists.\"\n* ''Jua '''ni''' nyota.'' \"The sun '''is''' a star.\"\n* ''Miti '''ni''' mimea mikubwa.'' \"Trees '''are''' large plants.\"\nIt may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic.\n* ''Babake '''ni''' mrefu sana.'' \"Her father '''is''' very tall.\"\n* ''Mji huyu '''ni''' mdogo.'' \"This town '''is''' small.\"\n* ''Misuli yako '''ni''' kama chuma.'' Your muscles '''are''' like steel. \nThe negative form '''''si''''' can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning:\n* ''Wewe '''si''' Bahati.'' \"You '''are not''' Bahati.\"\n* ''Jua '''si''' sayari.'' \"The sun '''is not''' a planet.\" \n* ''Pomboo '''si''' wadogo.'' \"Dolphins '''are not''' small.\"\nBecause '''''ni''''' and '''''si''''' do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!\n! colspan=\"2\" |Present\n! colspan=\"2\" |Past\n|-\n!Number\n!Person\n!Positive\n!Negative\n!Positive\n!Negative\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Singular\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1st\n|''mimi '''ni'''''\n|''mimi '''si'''''\n|''nilikuwa''\n|''sikuwa''\n|-\n|<small>I am</small>\n|<small>I am not</small>\n|<small>I was</small>\n|<small>I was not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2nd\n|''wewe '''ni'''''\n|''wewe '''si'''''\n|''ulikuwa''\n|''hukuwa''\n|-\n|<small>you are</small>\n|<small>you are not</small>\n|<small>you were</small>\n|<small>you were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3rd\n|''yeye '''ni'''''\n|''yeye '''si'''''\n|''alikuwa''\n|''hakuwa''\n|-\n|<small>s/he is</small>\n|<small>s/he is not</small>\n|<small>s/he was</small>\n|<small>s/he was not</small>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"6\" |Plural\n| rowspan=\"2\" |1st\n|''sisi '''ni'''''\n|''sisi '''si'''''\n|''tulikuwa''\n|''hatukuwa''\n|-\n|<small>we are</small>\n|<small>we are not</small>\n|we were\n|<small>we were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2nd\n|''nyinyi '''ni'''''\n|''nyinyi '''si'''''\n|''mlikuwa''\n|''hamkuwa''\n|-\n|<small>you are</small>\n|<small>you are not</small>\n|<small>you were</small>\n|<small>you were not</small>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |3rd\n|''wao '''ni'''''\n|''wao '''si'''''\n|''walikuwa''\n|''hawakuwa''\n|-\n|they are\n|<small>they are not</small>\n|they were\n|they were not\n|}\nA sentence begun with '''''ni''''' or '''''si''''' without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject \"it\" in English.

The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with ''na''. In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Person\n/ Class\n!Positive\n!Negative\n!<small>Translation</small>\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''ndimi, ndiye''\n|''simi, siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) I\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n| ''ndiwe, ndiye''\n|''siwe, siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''ndisi, ndio''\n|''sio, (sisi)*''\n|<small>\"it is (not) we\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''ndinyi, ndio''\n|''sinyi, sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1\n|''ndiye''\n|''siye''\n|<small>\"it is (not) s/he\"</small>\n|-\n! 2\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 3\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 4\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 5\n|''ndilo''\n|''silo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 6\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 7\n|''ndicho''\n|''sicho''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 8\n|''ndivyo''\n|''sivyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\", \"it is (not) so\"</small>\n|-\n! 9\n|''ndiyo''\n|''siyo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 10\n|''ndizo''\n|''sizo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) they\"</small>\n|-\n! 11\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 14\n|''ndio''\n|''sio''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n! 15\n|''ndiko''\n|''siko''\n|<small>\"it is (not) it\"</small>\n|-\n!16\n|''ndipo''\n|''sipo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) (t)here\"</small>\n|-\n! 17\n|''ndiko''\n|''siko''\n|<small>\"it is (not) around (t)here\"</small>\n|-\n!18\n|''ndimo''\n|''simo''\n|<small>\"it is (not) in (t)here\"</small>\n|}\n \n<nowiki>*</nowiki> The form ''sisi'' \"it is not us\" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun ''sisi'' \"we\", \"us\". Instead it is virtually always replaced with ''sio''.\n\nForms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" |'''''Mimi ndiye niliyewaona kwanza.'''''\n|-\n|'''mimi'''\n|ndi-'''ye'''\n|ni-li-'''ye'''-wa-on(a)\n|kwanza\n|-\n|'''1S'''\n|FOC.COP-'''CL1'''\n|1S-PST-'''REL.CL1'''-CL2-see\n|first\n|-\n|<small>\"I\"</small>\n|<small>\"am '''the one'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"(I) '''who''' saw them\"</small>\n|<small>\"first\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" |\"I'm the one who saw them first.\"\n|}\nCompare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Niliwaona kwanza.'''''\n|-\n|ni-li-wa-on(a)\n|kwanza\n|-\n|1S-PST-CL2-see\n|first\n|-\n|<small>\"I saw them\"</small>\n|<small>\"first\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"I saw them first.\"\n|}\n\n==== Location ====\nLocation is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo''. The class 1 subject concord ''a-'' (negative: ''ha-'') is however replaced with ''yu-'' (negative: ''hayu-'').\n\nThe three clitics, ''-po'', ''-ko'' and ''-mo'' correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate \"definite\", \"indefinite\" and \"internal\" location respectively. For example, ''wapo'' means essentially \"they are here/there\", ''wako'' means \"they are around here/there\" and ''wamo'' means \"they are in here/there\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!\n! colspan=\"3\" |Positive\n! colspan=\"3\" |Negative\n|-\n!Person\n/ Class\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Internal\n!Definite\n!Indefinite\n!Internal\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''nipo''\n|''niko''\n|''nimo''\n|''sipo''\n|''siko''\n|''simo''\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''hupo''\n|''huko''\n|''humo''\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''tupo''\n|''tuko''\n|''tumo''\n|''hatupo''\n|''hatuko''\n|''hatumo''\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''mpo''\n|''mko''\n|''mmo''\n|''hampo''\n|''hamko''\n|''hammo''\n|-\n! 1\n|''yupo''\n|''yuko''\n|''yumo''\n|''hayupo''\n|''hayuko''\n|''hayumo''\n|-\n! 2\n|''wapo''\n|''wako''\n|''wamo''\n|''hawapo''\n|''hawako''\n|''hawamo''\n|-\n! 3\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 4\n|''ipo''\n|''iko''\n|''imo''\n|''haipo''\n|''haiko''\n|''haimo''\n|-\n! 5\n|''lipo''\n|''liko''\n|''limo''\n|''halipo''\n|''haliko''\n|''halimo''\n|-\n! 6\n|''yapo''\n|''yako''\n|''yamo''\n|''hayapo''\n|''hayako''\n|''hayamo''\n|-\n! 7\n|''kipo''\n|''kiko''\n|''kimo''\n|''hakipo''\n|''hakiko''\n|''hakimo''\n|-\n! 8\n|''vipo''\n|''viko''\n|''vimo''\n|''havipo''\n|''haviko''\n|''havimo''\n|-\n! 9\n|''ipo''\n|''iko''\n|''imo''\n|''haipo''\n|''haiko''\n|''haimo''\n|-\n! 10\n|''zipo''\n|''ziko''\n|''zimo''\n|''hazipo''\n|''haziko''\n|''hazimo''\n|-\n! 11\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 14\n|''upo''\n|''uko''\n|''umo''\n|''haupo''\n|''hauko''\n|''haumo''\n|-\n! 15\n|''kupo''\n|''kuko''\n|''kumo''\n|''hakupo''\n|''hakuko''\n|''hakumo''\n|-\n!16\n|''<small>papo</small>''\n|''<small>pako</small>''\n|''<small>pamo</small>''\n|''<small>hapapo</small>''\n|''<small>hapako</small>''\n|''<small>hapamo</small>''\n|-\n! 17\n|''<small>kupo</small>''\n|''<small>kuko</small>''\n|''<small>kumo</small>''\n|''<small>hakupo</small>''\n|''<small>hakuko</small>''\n|''<small>hakumo</small>''\n|-\n!18\n|''<small>mpo</small>''\n|''<small>mko</small>''\n|''<small>mmo</small>''\n|''<small>hampo</small>''\n|''<small>hamko</small>''\n|''<small>hammo</small>''\n|}\nUnder a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance ''nipo hapa'' \"I am here\" is regarded as correct but ''niko hapa'' \"I am here\" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with ''-ko'' over the other forms, such that ''niko hapa'' is very common.\n\n==== State ====\nTemporary states of being are frequently expressed as if they were locations, generally with the ''-ko'' clitic. In older forms of Swahili, this ''-ko'' was generally absent, with the subject prefix appearing as a standalone word for the copula. Nowadays, this short form is less usual although it is still frequently encountered in common phrases such as ''U hali gani?'' ('How are you?', literally 'You are in what condition?')\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |'''''Yu(ko) tayari.'''''\n|-\n|'''yu-(ko)'''\n|tayari\n|-\n|'''CL1-(REF.CL17)'''\n|ready\n|-\n|<small>\"'''She/he is'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"ready\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"She is ready.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Mbona u(ko) kimya?'''''\n|-\n|mbona\n|'''u-(ko)'''\n|kimya\n|-\n|why.EMPH\n|'''CL2-(REF.CL17)'''\n|silent\n|-\n|<small>\"why\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"silent\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Why are you silent.\"\n|}\nNote that the standalone form of the 2<sup>nd</sup> person plural prefix ''m-'' is not *''m'' but ''mu''. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Je, mu wazima?'''''\n|-\n|je\n|mu\n|wa-zima\n|-\n|Q\n|2P\n|CL2-healthy\n|-\n|<small>\"Question:\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"healthy\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Are you well?\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |'''''Je, mko wazima?'''''\n|-\n|je\n|m-ko\n|wa-zima\n|-\n|Q\n|2P-REF.CL17\n|CL2-healthy\n|-\n|<small>\"Question:\"</small>\n|<small>\"'''you are'''\"</small>\n|<small>\"healthy\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Are you well?\"\n|}\n==== Relative forms ====\nIn the present tense, relative forms of the copula are formed with the subject prefix, the stem '''''-li-''''' in the positive and '''''-si-''''' in the negative, and the suffixed relative marker for the required noun class.

Its equivalent is ''kuwa na'', literally 'to be with', using the [[#Comitative_na|comitative preposition ''na'']]. In the present tense, however, ''kuwa na'' has special contractions, whereby the subject prefix is attached directly onto ''-na''.

For example, the verbs ''kulewa'' (\"to get drunk\"), ''kuchoka'' (\"to become tired\") and ''kuchelewa'' (\"to become late\") describe the respective changes to state from \"not drunk\" to \"drunk\", from \"not tired\" to \"tired\" and from \"not late\" to \"late\". These may be regarded as inherently [[inchoative verb]]s. There is, however, no equivalent ''[[stative verb]]'' for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. \"to be [state]\". Stative meanings such as \"be drunk\", \"be tired\" and \"be late\" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the [[#Perfect|perfect marker '''''-me-''''']] (or, in the negative, '''''-ja-'''''). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \nExamples\n|-\n!

The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the [[#Mediopassive|mediopassive]] below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition ''na'', which is here the equivalent of the English \"by\", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to \"and\" or \"with\".\n\n==== Mediopassive ====\nThe [[Mediopassive voice|mediopassive]] suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involved ends in ''-ka'' and generally the harmonic ''i'' or ''e'' before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost ''l'' of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic ''i'' or ''e''. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\nMediopassive suffix on common verbs\n!\n!Consonant-final \nroot\n\n(Consonant + ''-a'')\n!Vowel-final \nroot\n\n(Vowel + ''-a'')\n|-\n!Preceding syllable\nhas /a/, /i/, /u/ or /m\u0329/\n|''-ika''\n|''-ka'', ''-lika''\n|-\n!Preceding syllable\nhas /e/ or /o/\n|''-eka''\n|''-ka'', ''-leka''\n|}\n\n* ''-vunja'' \"to break (something)\" \u2192 ''-vunj'''ika''''' \"to break\" (intransitive)\n* ''-pika'' \"to cook (something)\" \u2192 ''-pik'''ika''''' \"to cook\" (intransitive)\n* ''-elewa'' \"to understand (something)\" \u2192 ''-elew'''eka''''' \"to be understood\"\n* ''-sikia'' \"to hear\" \u2192 ''-siki'''ka''''' \"to be heard; be audible\"\n* ''-kaa'' \"to sit; stay; inhabit\" \u2192 ''-ka'''lika''''' \"to be inhabited; be inhabitable\"\n* ''-zoea'' \"to get used to; grow accustomed to\" \u2192 ''-zoe'''lika''''' \"to become customary\"\n\nAs with the other derivational suffixes (or \"extensions\"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding '''''-ika''''' or '''''-eka''''' according to vowel harmony rules. The exceptions are those ending in '''''-au''''' which use '''''-lika''''.\n\n* ''-haribu'' \"to spoil (something); ruin; destroy\" \u2192 ''-harib'''ika''''' \"to spoil; get spoiled; get ruined; get destroyed\"\n* ''-sahau'' \"to forget\" \u2192 ''-sahau'''lika''''' \"to cook\" (intransitive)\n* ''-kebehi'' \"to ridicule; make fun of\" \u2192 ''-kebeh'''ika''''' \"to get ridiculed; get made fun of\"\n\nIn learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the \"'''stative''' extension\" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seidl|first=Amanda|last2=Dimitriadis|first2=Alexis|date=2003|title=Statives and reciprocal morphology in Swahili|url=http://www.let.uu.nl/users/Alexis.Dimitriadis/personal/papers/discon-long-ms04.pdf|journal=Typologie des Langues d'Afrique et Universaux de la Grammaire|volume= 1: Approches transversales, domaine bantou|pages=239\u2013284|via=}}</ref> For example, the mediopassive verb ''-vunj'''ika''''' \"to break; go to pieces\" contrasts with its source verb ''-vunja'' \"to break; make go to pieces\", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic \u2014 both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time \u2014 but in that the subject of ''-vunjika'' is equivalent to the object of ''-vunja'', and the subject of ''-vunja'' is completely absent from a clause with ''-vunj'''ika'''''. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |Active transitive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Juma alivunja dirisha.''\n|-\n|Juma\n|a-li-vunj(a)\n|dirisha\n|-\n|[male name]\n|CL1-PST-break(TR)\n|(CL5)window\n|-\n|<small>\"Juma\"</small>\n|<small>\"s/he broke\"</small>\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"Juma '''broke''' the window.\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"3\" |Passive transitive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |''Dirisha lilivunjwa (na Juma).''\n|-\n|dirisha\n|li-li-vunj(a)-'''w(a)'''\n|(na Juma)\n|-\n|(CL5)window\n|CL5-PST-break(TR)-'''PASS'''\n|(COM [male name])\n|-\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|<small>\"it was broken\"</small>\n|<small>(\"by Juma\"</small>)\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" |\"The window '''was broken''' (by Juma).\"\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"2\" |Mediopassive verb (dynamic):\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |''Dirisha lilivunjika.''\n|-\n|dirisha\n|li-li-vunj(a)-'''ik(a)'''\n|-\n|(CL5)window\n|CL5-PST-break(TR)-'''MEDIOPASS'''\n|-\n|<small>\"window\"</small>\n|<small>\"it broke\"</small>\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |\"The window '''broke'''.\"\n|}\nMediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence \"''Dirisha li'''me'''vunjika''\" means either \"The window <u>has</u> broken,\" or \"The window <u>is</u> broken.\" What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, ''-vunjika'', does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from \"whole; intact\" to \"broken; in pieces\". The perfect ''-me-'' here indicates that one is concerned with the state after the dynamic process.\n\n==== Reversive ====\n==== Suffix stacking ====\nSuffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili.\n\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 -''andik'''wa''''' \"to be written\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''isha''''' \"to cause to write\" \u2192 ''-andikish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to write\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''ia''''' \"to write to\" \u2192 ''-andiki'''wa''''' \"to be written to\"\n* ''-andika'' \"to write\" \u2192 ''-andik'''ia''''' \"to write to\" \u2192 ''-andiki'''ana''''' \"to write to each other\" \u2192 -''andikian'''isha''''' \"to cause to write to each other\" \u2192 -''andikianish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to write to each other\"\n\nHere is another rather more implausible example:\n* ''-la'' \"to eat\" \n: \u2192 ''-l'''ika''''' \"to be edible\" \n:: \u2192 ''-lik'''ia''''' \"to be edible to\" \n::: \u2192 ''-liki'''ana''''' \"to be edible to each other\" \n:::: \u2192 ''-likian'''isha''''' \"to cause to be edible to each other\" \n::::: \u2192 ''-likianish'''wa''''' \"to be caused to be edible to each other\"\n\n== Prepositions ==\n=== Comitative ''na'' ===\nIn addition to functioning as a conjunction meaning \"and\", ''na'' is also a very common preposition meaning:\n\n# ''\"With\"'' in a [[Comitative case|comitative]] sense (\"together with\", \"along with\", \"accompanied by\"), often occurring after reciprocal verbs ending in ''-ana''.   ''Njoo '''na'''mi.'' \"Come with me.\"   ''Yuko pale pamoja '''na''' rafiki zake.'' \"She is there with her friends.\"   ''Dada yako ananfanana '''na''' mama yenu.'' \"Your sister looks like your mother.\n# \"''With''\" in an [[Ornative case|ornative]] sense (\"having\") when appearing with the verb ''kuwa'' \"to be\" to form ''kuwa na'' \"to have\".    ''Ni'''na''' pesa zako.'' \"I have your money.\"  ''Kusingekuwa '''na''' mbu.'' \"There wouldn't be any mosquitos.\" (See: [[#'To_have'|'to have']])\n# \"''By''\" when introducing the [[Agent (grammar)|agent]] in a passive sentence.   ''Alipendwa sana '''na''' kila mtu kijijini.'' \"He was loved by everyone in the village.\"\n\nShortened forms of pronouns are frequently suffixed to ''na'', both when ''na'' is used as a preposition.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n!Person\n/ Class\n!Short\n!Full form\n!<small>Translation</small>\n|-\n! 1st sing.\n|''nami''\n|''na mimi''\n|<small>\"with me\", \"by me\", \"and I\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd sing.\n|''nawe''\n|''na wewe''\n|<small>\"with you\", \"by you\", \"and you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1st plur.\n|''nasi''\n|''na sisi''\n|<small>\"with us\", \"by us\", \"and we\"</small>\n|-\n! 2nd plur.\n|''nanyi''\n|''na ninyi''\n|<small>\"with you\", \"by you\", \"and you\"</small>\n|-\n! 1\n|''naye''\n|''na yeye''\n|<small>\"with him/her\", \"by her/him\", \"and she/he\"</small>\n|-\n! 2\n|''nao''\n|''na wao''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 3\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 4\n|''nayo''\n|''na hiyo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 5\n|''nalo''\n|''na hilo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 6\n|''nayo''\n|''na hayo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 7\n|''nacho''\n|''na hicho''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 8\n|''navyo''\n|''na hivyo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 9\n|''nayo''\n|''na hiyo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 10\n|''nazo''\n|''na hizo''\n|<small>\"with them\", \"by them\", \"and they\"</small>\n|-\n! 11\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 14\n|''nao''\n|''na huo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\"</small>\n|-\n! 15\n|''nako''\n|''na huko''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [action]</small>\n|-\n!16\n|''napo''\n|''na hapo''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|-\n! 17\n|''nako''\n|''na huko''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|-\n!18\n|''namu''\n|''na humu''\n|<small>\"with it\", \"by it\", \"and it\" [place]</small>\n|}\n\n=== Genitive ''-a'' ===\n\nThe genitive preposition ''-a'' (sometimes termed a \"connector\", \"possessive\" or \"associative\" preposition) has a similar role to that of the [[genitive case]] of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition \"of\". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:\n\n* '''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''a mwanafunzi'' \"the student's book\" (\"book of student\")\n* '''''vi'''tabu '''vy'''a mwanafunzi'' \"the student's books\" (\"books of student\")\n\nThe equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as ''taa ya barabarani'' \"traffic light\", \"street light\", which is literally equivalent to \"light of road-LOC\".\n\nThe personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example:\n\n*'''''ki'''tabu '''ch'''ake'' \"his/her book\"\n\nThe genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see [[#Subject_and_object_concords|here]]), plus ''-a''. There are some sound changes that happen. ''U-'' and ''i-'' become their equivalent semivowels ''w-'' and ''y-'' respectively. After consonants, this '''y''' is generally dropped although ''ki-'' and ''vi-'' become ''ch-'' and ''vy-''. The class 1 verbal concord ''a-'' is an exception, being replaced with ''w-'' in the genitive construction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Class\n! <small>Verbal subject concord</small>\n!

It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of ''-a''. Where there is no 15 or class 17 [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]], its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an [[instrumental case|instrumental]] use of \"by (means of)\", \"using\" or \"with\". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by ''kwenye'' for inanimate referents.\n\n* ''Tulikuja kwa miguu.'' \"We came on foot.\" (Literally: \"We came by feet.\")\n* ''Alirudi kwa Rehema.'' \"She returned to Rehema's (place).\"\n\n=== Ornative ''-enye'' ===\n\nThe [[Ornative case|ornative]] preposition ''-enye'' essentially means \"having\" or \"with\" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive '''-a''' with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix ''mw-'' instead of ''w-''. The word ''-enye'' is followed by a noun. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In addition to comedies and political satire, he wrote several musicals for the [[Marx Brothers]] and others. He won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama for the musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (with [[Morrie Ryskind]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]) in 1932, and won again in 1937 for the play ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (with [[Moss Hart]]). He also won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Director in 1951 for the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nGeorge S. Kaufman was born to Joseph S. Kaufman, a hatband manufacturer,<ref name=\"1910 United States Federal Census\">1910 United States Federal Census</ref> and Nettie Meyers<ref>U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007</ref> in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He had a younger sister, Ruth.<ref name=\"1910 United States Federal Census\"/> His other sister was Helen, nicknamed \"Helse.\" Kaufman's family were Jewish. He graduated from high school in 1907 and studied law for three months. He grew disenchanted and took on a series of odd jobs,<ref name=wallace>Wallace, Irving, Amy Wallace, David Wallechinsky and Sylvia Wallace (2008).

He became close friends with Adams, who helped him get his first newspaper job\u2014humor columnist for ''[[Washington Times-Herald|The Washington Times]]''\u2014in 1912. By 1915 he was a drama reporter on ''[[New-York Tribune|The New York Tribune]]'', working under [[Heywood Broun]]. In 1917 Kaufman joined ''[[The New York Times]]'', becoming drama editor and staying with the newspaper until 1930.<ref name=obit/>\n\nKaufman took his editorial responsibilities seriously.

His most successful of such efforts include two Broadway shows crafted for the Marx Brothers, ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'', written with [[Irving Berlin]], and ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'', written with [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Bert Kalmar]], and [[Harry Ruby]]. According to Charlotte Chandler, \"By the time ''Animal Crackers'' opened ... the Marx Brothers were becoming famous enough to interest Hollywood. Paramount signed them to a contract\".<ref>Chandler, Charlotte (2007). ''Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|1-4165-6521-3}}.</ref>  Kaufman was one of the writers who excelled in writing intelligent nonsense for [[Groucho Marx]], a process that was collaborative, given Groucho's skills at expanding upon the scripted material. Though the Marx Brothers were notoriously critical of their writers, Groucho and [[Harpo Marx]] expressed admiration and gratitude towards Kaufman. [[Dick Cavett]], introducing Groucho onstage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1972, told the audience that Groucho considered Kaufman to be \"his god\".\n\nWhile ''The Cocoanuts'' was being developed in Atlantic City, Irving Berlin was hugely enthusiastic about including the song \"[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]\", which he had written as a wedding present for his bride.{{efn|1=Both Kaufman and Marx describe the song as having been written expressly for the show,<ref name=\"Kaufman site\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgeskaufman.com/play-catalogue/16-play-catalogue/critics-choice/80-the-cocoanuts-1925.html |title=The Cocoanuts (1925) |last=Schneider |first=Anne Kaufman |last2=Maslon |first2=Laurence |year=2013 |website=George S.

The song ultimately became a huge hit for Berlin, recorded by many popular performers. According to Laurence Bergreen, \"Kaufman's lack of enthusiasm caused Irving to lose confidence in the song, and 'Always' was deleted from the score of ''The Cocoanuts'' \u2013 though not from its creator's memory. ... Kaufman, a confirmed misogynist, had had no use for the song in ''The Cocoanuts'' but his disapproval did not deter Berlin from saving it for a more important occasion.\"<ref>Bergreen, Laurence  (1996). ''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-80675-4}}, pp. 249, 264.</ref> ''The Cocoanuts'' would remain Irving Berlin's only Broadway musical \u2013 until his last one, ''[[Mr. President (musical)|Mr. President]]'' \u2013 that did not include at least one eventual hit song.\n\nHumor derived from political situations was of particular interest to Kaufman. He collaborated on the hit musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', which won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, the first musical so honored,<ref name=pulitzer/> and its sequel ''[[Let 'Em Eat Cake]]'', as well as one troubled but eventually successful satire that had several incarnations, ''[[Strike Up the Band (musical)|Strike Up the Band]]''. Working with Kaufman on these ventures were Ryskind, [[George Gershwin]], and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Also, Kaufman, with Moss Hart, wrote the book to ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'', a musical starring [[George M. Cohan]] as [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (the U.S. President at the time), with songs by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. He also co-wrote the 1935 comedy-drama ''[[First Lady (play)|First Lady]]''.  In 1945, Kaufman adapted ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' into ''[[Hollywood Pinafore]]''.\n\nKaufman also contributed to major New York revues, including ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (which shared songs but not plot with the 1953 film version) with [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]]. His often anthologized sketch \"The Still Alarm\" from the revue ''[[The Little Show]]'' lasted long after the show closed. Another well-known sketch of his is \"If Men Played Cards As Women Do.\" There have also been musicals based on Kaufman properties, such as the 1981 musical version of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', adapted by [[George Furth]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].<ref>Rich, Frank (November 17, 1981).

Among the more well-received were ''[[Dinner at Eight (play)|Dinner At Eight]]'', ''[[Stage Door]]'' (almost completely rewritten by others for the film version) and ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (changed significantly by others for the film version), which won the Best Picture [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in 1938. He also occasionally wrote directly for the movies, most significantly the screenplay for ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' for the Marx Brothers. His only credit as a [[film director]] was ''[[The Senator Was Indiscreet]]'' (1947) starring William Powell.\n\nFrom 1949 until midway through the 1952\u20131953 season, he appeared as a panelist on the [[CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[This Is Show Business]]''.<ref>McNeil, Alex.

In addition to comedies and political satire, he wrote several musicals for the [[Marx Brothers]] and others. He won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama for the musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (with [[Morrie Ryskind]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]) in 1932, and won again in 1937 for the play ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (with [[Moss Hart]]). He also won the [[Tony Award]] for Best Director in 1951 for the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nGeorge S. Kaufman was born to Joseph S. Kaufman, a hatband manufacturer,<ref name=\"1910 United States Federal Census\">1910 United States Federal Census</ref> and Nettie Meyers<ref>U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007</ref> in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. He had a younger sister, Ruth.<ref name=\"1910 United States Federal Census\"/> His other sister was Helen, nicknamed \"Helse.\" Kaufman's family were Jewish.

His most successful of such efforts include two Broadway shows crafted for the Marx Brothers, ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'', written with [[Irving Berlin]], and ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'', written with [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Bert Kalmar]], and [[Harry Ruby]]. According to Charlotte Chandler, \"By the time ''Animal Crackers'' opened ... the Marx Brothers were becoming famous enough to interest Hollywood. Paramount signed them to a contract\".<ref>Chandler, Charlotte (2007). ''Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|1-4165-6521-3}}.</ref>  Kaufman was one of the writers who excelled in writing intelligent nonsense for [[Groucho Marx]], a process that was collaborative, given Groucho's skills at expanding upon the scripted material. Though the Marx Brothers were notoriously critical of their writers, Groucho and [[Harpo Marx]] expressed admiration and gratitude towards Kaufman. [[Dick Cavett]], introducing Groucho onstage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1972, told the audience that Groucho considered Kaufman to be \"his god\".\n\nWhile ''The Cocoanuts'' was being developed in Atlantic City, Irving Berlin was hugely enthusiastic about including the song \"[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]\", which he had written as a wedding present for his bride.{{efn|1=Both Kaufman and Marx describe the song as having been written expressly for the show,<ref name=\"Kaufman site\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgeskaufman.com/play-catalogue/16-play-catalogue/critics-choice/80-the-cocoanuts-1925.html |title=The Cocoanuts (1925) |last=Schneider |first=Anne Kaufman |last2=Maslon |first2=Laurence |year=2013 |website=George S.

The song ultimately became a huge hit for Berlin, recorded by many popular performers. According to Laurence Bergreen, \"Kaufman's lack of enthusiasm caused Irving to lose confidence in the song, and 'Always' was deleted from the score of ''The Cocoanuts'' \u2013 though not from its creator's memory. ... Kaufman, a confirmed misogynist, had had no use for the song in ''The Cocoanuts'' but his disapproval did not deter Berlin from saving it for a more important occasion.\"<ref>Bergreen, Laurence  (1996). ''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-80675-4}}, pp. 249, 264.</ref> ''The Cocoanuts'' would remain Irving Berlin's only Broadway musical \u2013 until his last one, ''[[Mr. President (musical)|Mr. President]]'' \u2013 that did not include at least one eventual hit song.\n\nHumor derived from political situations was of particular interest to Kaufman. He collaborated on the hit musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', which won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, the first musical so honored,<ref name=pulitzer/> and its sequel ''[[Let 'Em Eat Cake]]'', as well as one troubled but eventually successful satire that had several incarnations, ''[[Strike Up the Band (musical)|Strike Up the Band]]''. Working with Kaufman on these ventures were Ryskind, [[George Gershwin]], and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Also, Kaufman, with Moss Hart, wrote the book to ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'', a musical starring [[George M. Cohan]] as [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (the U.S. President at the time), with songs by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. He also co-wrote the 1935 comedy-drama ''[[First Lady (play)|First Lady]]''.  In 1945, Kaufman adapted ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' into ''[[Hollywood Pinafore]]''.\n\nKaufman also contributed to major New York revues, including ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (which shared songs but not plot with the 1953 film version) with [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]]. His often anthologized sketch \"The Still Alarm\" from the revue ''[[The Little Show]]'' lasted long after the show closed. Another well-known sketch of his is \"If Men Played Cards As Women Do.\" There have also been musicals based on Kaufman properties, such as the 1981 musical version of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', adapted by [[George Furth]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].<ref>Rich, Frank (November 17, 1981).

Among the more well-received were ''[[Dinner at Eight (play)|Dinner At Eight]]'', ''[[Stage Door]]'' (almost completely rewritten by others for the film version) and ''[[You Can't Take It with You (film)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (changed significantly by others for the film version), which won the Best Picture [[Academy Award|Oscar]] in 1938. He also occasionally wrote directly for the movies, most significantly the screenplay for ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' for the Marx Brothers. His only credit as a [[film director]] was ''[[The Senator Was Indiscreet]]'' (1947) starring William Powell.\n\nFrom 1949 until midway through the 1952\u20131953 season, he appeared as a panelist on the [[CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[This Is Show Business]]''.<ref>McNeil, Alex.

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh's recently widowed sister, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yochabel dies sometime later.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' - including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the [[diegetic music]] required for the film's dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator [[Victor Young]] to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.<ref name=\"DeWald\">{{cite news|last1=DeWald|first1=Frank K.|title=So Let It Be Written.

The score is written in a highly [[Romantic music|Romantic]] style, featuring unique musical [[leitmotif]]s for the film's characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, etc.) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille's direction, by the opera scores of [[Richard Wagner]].<ref name=\"DeWald\"/> Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the  score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.<ref>{{cite news|last1=|first1=|title=Technical Notes|work=The Ten Commandments: 60th Anniversary Soundtrack Collection|publisher=Intrada Records|date=2016}}</ref>\n\nA double-LP [[monaural]] soundtrack album was released in 1957 by [[Dot Records]], utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Ratings by year (since 2007)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

[[Jochebed|Yochabel]] saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the [[Nile]]. [[Bithiah]], the Pharaoh's recently widowed sister, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby [[Moses]].\n\nPrince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with [[Ethiopia]] and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]] fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh [[Seti I|Sethi]]'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter [[Joshua]], who tells him of the [[Yahweh|Hebrew God]]. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n\nMoses reforms the treatment of [[slaves]] on the project, but Prince [[Ramesses II|Rameses]], Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n\nNefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of [[Levite]] cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, brother Aaron, and sister Miriam.\n\nMoses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer [[Dathan]], who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yochabel dies sometime later.\n\nMoses makes his way across the desert to a well in [[Midian]]. After defending seven sisters from [[Amalekites]], Moses is housed with the girls' father [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter [[Zipporah|Sephora]]. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the [[burning bush]] on the summit of [[Mount Sinai]] and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n\nMoses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a [[cobra]]. [[Jannes and Jambres|Jannes]] performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n\nEgypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of [[Khnum]] and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins [[the Exodus]] from Egypt.\n\nAfter being taunted by Nefretiri, Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the [[Red Sea]]. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] and [[Crossing the Red Sea|parts the Red Sea]]. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n\nMoses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the [[Ten Commandments]] created by God in [[Tablets of Stone|two stone tablets]]. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a [[golden calf]] idol. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n<!-- DO NOT add biblical information here. This film is not about the book of Exodus; making historical/biblical comparisons here is not relevant, and it does not contribute to the completeness of the article. DO NOT add it again. -->\n\nAfter God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n\nForty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards [[Canaan]]. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n\n==Cast==\nIn the film's [[title sequence]], the cast is credited in the following order:\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Charlton Heston]] as [[Moses]] (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)<ref name=\"Charlton Heston: The EW Q&A\" />\n* [[Yul Brynner]] as [[Ramesses II|Rameses II]]\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as [[Nefertari|Nefretiri]]\n* [[Edward G.

Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the [[Quran]], which was sometimes used as a source.  She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. [[Arnold Friberg]] would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for [[The Robe (film)|''The Robe'']], as well as textiles and costume fabrics for ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]'', ''[[David and Bathsheba (film)|David and Bathsheba]]'', and others.\n\nJesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on ''The Ten Commandments'', described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained [[Joshua]] to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n\nThe Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the [[Pschent|red-and-white crown]] of [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] or the [[nemes]] royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue [[Khepresh]] helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n\nSets, costumes and props from the film ''[[The Egyptian (film)|The Egyptian]]'' were bought and re-used for ''The Ten Commandments'' - including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in ''The Egyptian'' take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n\nAn Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Sethi's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier [[Mehu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/partytime.htm|title=Party Time in Ancient Egypt|publisher=}}</ref>\nSome of the film's cast members, such as [[Anne Baxter|Baxter]], [[Debra Paget|Paget]], [[John Derek|Derek]], and [[Nina Foch|Foch]], wore brown [[contact lens]]es, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles.<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\">{{cite news |last=Belser |first=Emily |title=Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat=19550601&id=BtUzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EesFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3432,38731 |accessdate=March 28, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Miami News]] |date=June 1, 1955}}</ref> Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\"<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the [[Klieg light|kleig light]]s heat them up\".<ref name=\"Now Stars Change Eyes Just Like Pair Of Shoes\" /> When DeMille cast [[Yvonne De Carlo]] as [[Zipporah|Sephora]], she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature.<ref name=\"Katherine Orrison's audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)\">[[Katherine Orrison]]'s audio commentary for ''The Ten Commandments'' 50th Anniversary Collection DVD (2006)</ref> She asked DeMille to make an exception for her.

In fact, many of the supposed inaccuracies were actually adopted by DeMille from extra-biblical ancient sources, such as [[Josephus]], the Sepher ha-Yashar, and the [[Chronicle of Moses]]. Moses's career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on ancient [[midrash]]im.<ref>L. Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, Philadelphia 1967; A.

Since 2006 the network has typically aired ''The Ten Commandments'' on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7&nbsp;p.m. in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone]]s and 6&nbsp;p.m. [[Central Time Zone|Central]]/[[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]]/[[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]]/[[Hawaii Time Zone|Hawaii]]. The film is one of only two pre-scheduled ''[[ABC Saturday Movie of the Week|ABC Saturday Movies of the Week]]'' every year, the other being ''[[The Sound of Music (1965 film)|The Sound of Music]]''.\n\nUnlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show ''The Ten Commandments'' in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included [[CBS]]' coverage of the [[1997 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game|NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game]].<ref>''TV Guide'' listings for March 29 \u2013 April 4, 1997.</ref>\n\nThe length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years; today, ABC's total run time for ''The Ten Commandments'' stands at four hours and forty-four minutes, just above one hour longer its three-hour and thirty-nine-minute length. This requires the network to overrun into the 11&nbsp;p.m./10&nbsp;p.m. timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late [[local news]] and any other programming they may air in the overnight hours. Affiliates may also delay the film to the usual start of [[prime time]] at 8&nbsp;p.m./7&nbsp;p.m. to keep their schedules in line for early evening, at the cost of further delaying their local newscasts or forgoing them entirely.\n\nIn 2010, the film was broadcast in [[high-definition television|high definition]] for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original VistaVision aspect ratio. It is also broadcast with its original [[Spanish language]] dub over the [[second audio program]] channel. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2015/02/27/abc-to-broadcast-the-ten-commandments-on-easter/|title=ABC to Broadcast \"The Ten Commandments\" on Easter|work=Channel Guide Magazine|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n;Ratings by year (since 2007)\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R. Ward. \"Dried plasmas\" in powder or strips of material format were developed and first used in [[World War II]].

Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle. In about three minutes, the plasma would be ready to use and could stay fresh for around four hours.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter7.htm Plasma Equipment and Packaging, and Transfusion Equipment]</ref> The Blood for Britain program operated successfully for five months, with total collections of almost 15,000 people donating blood, and with over 5,500 vials of blood plasma.<ref name=\"plasma\">{{cite book   | last = Starr   | first = Douglas P.\n  | title     = Blood: An Epic History of Medicine and Commerce   | location  = New York   | publisher = Quill\n  | year      = 2000   | isbn      = 0-688-17649-6 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the \"Plasma for Britain\" invention, Drew was named director of the [[Red Cross]] [[blood bank]] and assistant director of the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]], in charge of blood collection for the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]].

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]].

Adding citrate and other anticoagulants is a relatively recent advance. Note that, upon formation of a clot, the remaining clear fluid (if any) is [[Serum (blood)]], which is essentially plasma without the clotting factors.\n\nThe use of blood plasma as a substitute for whole blood and for transfusion purposes was proposed in March 1918, in the correspondence columns of the British Medical Journal, by Gordon R.

Drew|Charles Drew]]'s contribution. A large project began in August 1940 to collect blood in New York City hospitals for the export of plasma to Britain. Drew was appointed medical supervisor of the \"[[Plasma for Britain]]\" project. His notable contribution at this time was to transform the [[test tube]] methods of many blood researchers into the first successful mass production techniques.\n\nNevertheless, the decision was made to develop a dried plasma package for the armed forces as it would reduce breakage and make the transportation, packaging, and storage much simpler.<ref>[http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/blood/chapter1.htm Transfusion before World War I]</ref> The resulting dried plasma package came in two tin cans containing 400 cc bottles. One bottle contained enough [[distilled water]] to reconstitute the dried plasma contained within the other bottle.

When donating whole blood or [[packed red blood cell]] (PRBC) transfusions, [[ABO blood type|O-]] is the most desirable and is considered a \"universal donor,\" since it has neither A nor B [[antigens]] and can be safely transfused to most recipients. Type AB+ is the \"universal recipient\" type for PRBC donations. However, for plasma the situation is somewhat reversed. Blood donation centers will sometimes collect only plasma from AB donors through [[apheresis]], as their plasma does not contain the antibodies that may cross react with recipient antigens. As such, AB is often considered the \"universal donor\" for plasma. Special programs exist just to cater to the male AB plasma donor, because of concerns about [[transfusion related acute lung injury]] (TRALI) and female donors who may have higher leukocyte antibodies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.nih.gov/blooddonor/donationtypes/ab_plasma.html |title=AB Plasma Donor Program |publisher=NIH Clinical Center |date=March 20, 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-18}}</ref> However, some studies show an increased risk of TRALI despite increased leukocyte antibodies in women who have been pregnant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/564739 |title=Female Plasma May Not Increase Risk for Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury |publisher=Medscape |date=October 23, 2007 |accessdate=2011-07-02}}</ref>\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nFollowing fears of [[variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease]] ([[vCJD]]) being spread through the blood supply, the British government began{{when|date=March 2020}} to import plasma (to meet the need for commercially manufactured fractionated plasma medicines) and (through devolved Blood Services) imported plasma from Europe (to meet the needs for plasma blood components for certain patient groups). In 2002, the British government purchased Life Resources Incorporated to import plasma for medicines made from fractionated plasma. The company became Plasma Resources UK (PRUK) which owned [[Bio Products Laboratory]]. In 2013, the British government sold an 80% stake in PRUK to American hedge fund Bain Capital, in a deal estimated to be worth \u00a3230 million. The sale was met with criticism in the UK.\n\nCurrently,{{when|date=March 2020}} blood donated in the United Kingdom is used by UK Blood Services for the manufacture of plasma blood components (Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and cryoprecipitate).

They immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1946. Gary studied music at the Music Teachers' College in [[Tel Aviv]] and then in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and at the [[Paris Conservatoire]].\n\nUpon returning to Israel, Gary Bertini established Rinat (the Israel Chamber [[Choir]]) in 1955. He was musical advisor to the [[Batsheva Dance Company]] and composed incidental music for numerous productions of [[Habima Theatre|Habima]], the Israel national theater, and the [[Cameri Theatre]]. He founded the [[Israel Chamber Orchestra]] in 1965 and was its conductor until 1975. He was the music director of the Israeli opera between the years 1988-1997.[http://www.israel-opera.co.il/eng/?CategoryID=192&ArticleID=1350]\n\nBertini was conductor of the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]] from 1978 to 1986.

His father, K. A. Bertini (Aron Golergant), was a [[poet]] and [[translator]] of the [[Russian language|Russian]] ([[Leonid Andrejew|Leonid Andereyev]]) and [[Yiddish]] ([[Abraham Sutzkever|A.Sutzkever]], [[H. Leivick]]) literature into [[Hebrew]], and of the Hebrew works into Yiddish. His mother Berta Golergant was a [[physician]] and [[biologist]]. They immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] in 1946. Gary  studied music at the Music Teachers' College in [[Tel Aviv]] and then in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], and at the [[Paris Conservatoire]].\n\nUpon returning to Israel, Gary Bertini established Rinat (the Israel Chamber [[Choir]]) in 1955. He was musical advisor to the [[Batsheva Dance Company]] and composed incidental music for numerous productions of [[Habima Theatre|Habima]], the Israel national theater, and the [[Cameri Theatre]]. He founded the [[Israel Chamber Orchestra]] in 1965 and was its conductor until 1975. He was the music director of the Israeli opera between the years 1988-1997. [http://www.israel-opera.co.il/eng/?CategoryID=192&ArticleID=1350]\n\nBertini was conductor of the [[Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra]] from 1978 to 1986. He was also the artistic director of the [[New Israeli Opera]] from 1994 until his death. He promoted Israeli music and helped shape it.\n\nBertini was hospitalized while in Paris, then transferred to a hospital in [[Tel Hashomer]], Israel.

The song was released as a single on [[Monument Records]] in 1966 and became a major ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country hit. \"Don't Touch Me\" became Seely's [[signature song]] and her biggest hit as a solo artist. It would later appear on her [[The Seely Style|debut studio album]] and be re-recorded by Seely in later years. \n\n\"Don't Touch Me\" has been covered by various artists.

Cochran had promised Seely the opportunity to collaborate musically. When she asked Cochran if the offer still stood, Cochran replied, \"Yes, if you're going to let me make the decisions and do what I know is best for you.\" Seely agreed and in response, Cochran gave her the composition to record.{{sfn|Oermann, Robert K.|Bufwack, Mary A.|2003|p=301}} Seely then signed with [[Monument Records]] in Nashville and recorded \"Don't Touch Me\" in her first session with producer [[Fred Foster]].
