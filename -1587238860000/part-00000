Each section contains a diverse array of neighborhoods. The Eastside, located east of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and north of the Red Cedar River, is the most ethnically diverse side of Lansing, with foreign-born citizens making up more of its population than any other side in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://allenneighborhoodcenter.org |title = Allen Neighborhood Center - Serving the Eastside of Lansing, MI |work = allenneighborhoodcenter.org }}</ref>  The Eastside's commercial districts are located mainly along Michigan Avenue, and to a lesser extent along Kalamazoo Street. It is anchored by Frandor [[Shopping mall|Shopping Center]] on the very eastern edge of the eastside.\n\nThe Westside, roughly located north, west, and south of the Grand River as it curves through the city, is sometimes regarded the city's most socio-economically diverse section. This side also contains Lansing's downtown area, though this neighborhood is often included as an area all its own. Outside downtown, this side is largely a collection of residential neighborhoods and is served by only one other commercial area along Saginaw Street. However, it also includes a small part of the Old Town Commercial Association.\n\nThe Northwestside, generally located north of the Grand River, with the [[city limits]] defining its north and western borders, is physically the smallest side of the city. This part of the city includes moderate-density residential areas and some green areas. North of Grand River Avenue, the main street of the side, lie warehouses and light industrial areas served by a major rail line that runs through Lansing. The most notable landmark of this side is Lansing's airport: [[Capital Region International Airport]].\n\nThe Southside, usually described as the neighborhoods located south of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers and the I-496 freeway, is physically the largest and most populous side of the city. The area is largely residential in nature (south of Mount Hope Road near the northern edge), and is served by numerous commercial strips along Cedar Street, [[Streets named after Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard]], Pennsylvania Avenue, and Waverly Road, which run north/south. The large Edgewood District is located in the southernmost part of the Southside and is sometimes referred to as South Lansing.

This land lay in a [[floodplain]] and was underwater during the majority of the year. Nevertheless, the brothers went back to [[Lansing, New York]], to sell plots for the town that did not exist. They told the New Yorkers this new \"city\" had an area of 65 blocks, a church and a public and academic square. 16 men bought plots in the nonexistent city, and upon reaching the area later that year found they had been scammed. Many in the group, too disappointed to stay, ended up settling around what is now metropolitan Lansing.

The United States had recaptured the city in 1813, but these events led to the dire need to have the center of government relocate from hostile [[British America|British territory]].

The boundaries of the original city were Douglas Avenue to the north, Wood and Regent streets to the east, Mount Hope Avenue to the south, and Jenison Avenue to the west. These boundaries would remain until 1916. Lansing began to grow steadily over the next two decades with the completion of the railroads through the city, a [[plank road]], and the completion of the current capitol building in 1878.\n\nMost of what is known as Lansing today is the result of the city becoming an industrial powerhouse which began with the founding of [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] in August 1897. The company went through many changes, including a buyout, between its founding to 1905 when founder [[Ransom E. Olds]] started his new [[REO Motor Car Company]], which would last in Lansing for another 70&nbsp;years. Olds would be joined by the less successful [[Clarkmobile]] around 1903.<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

[[Ransom Eli Olds]]' home, which once overlooked the factories along Washington Avenue, was displaced by I-496.\n\nLansing is generally divided into four sections: Eastside, Westside, Northwestside, and the Southside. Each section contains a diverse array of neighborhoods. The Eastside, located east of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and north of the Red Cedar River, is the most ethnically diverse side of Lansing, with foreign-born citizens making up more of its population than any other side in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://allenneighborhoodcenter.org |title = Allen Neighborhood Center - Serving the Eastside of Lansing, MI |work = allenneighborhoodcenter.org }}</ref>  The Eastside's commercial districts are located mainly along Michigan Avenue, and to a lesser extent along Kalamazoo Street. It is anchored by Frandor [[Shopping mall|Shopping Center]] on the very eastern edge of the eastside.\n\nThe Westside, roughly located north, west, and south of the Grand River as it curves through the city, is sometimes regarded the city's most socio-economically diverse section. This side also contains Lansing's downtown area, though this neighborhood is often included as an area all its own. Outside downtown, this side is largely a collection of residential neighborhoods and is served by only one other commercial area along Saginaw Street. However, it also includes a small part of the Old Town Commercial Association.\n\nThe Northwestside, generally located north of the Grand River, with the [[city limits]] defining its north and western borders, is physically the smallest side of the city. This part of the city includes moderate-density residential areas and some green areas. North of Grand River Avenue, the main street of the side, lie warehouses and light industrial areas served by a major rail line that runs through Lansing. The most notable landmark of this side is Lansing's airport: [[Capital Region International Airport]].\n\nThe Southside, usually described as the neighborhoods located south of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers and the I-496 freeway, is physically the largest and most populous side of the city. The area is largely residential in nature (south of Mount Hope Road near the northern edge), and is served by numerous commercial strips along Cedar Street, [[Streets named after Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard]], Pennsylvania Avenue, and Waverly Road, which run north/south. The large Edgewood District is located in the southernmost part of the Southside and is sometimes referred to as South Lansing. Though it is the largest area of the city by both physical size and population, it has often been regarded by Southside citizens as Lansing's most overlooked and forgotten area, as most of Lansing's attention in recent decades has been put into the revitalization of the city's historic core located mostly on small parts of both the East and Westsides.\n\nThe middle of the Southside\u2014South-Central Lansing\u2014contains the Old Everett Area.
