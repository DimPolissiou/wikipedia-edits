It was written by all members of the band for their fourth album, ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends]]'' (2008), and was released as the second single from the album. On the album, this song segues directly into the next track, \"[[Violet Hill]]\".\n\nThe lyrics to the song contain historical and Christian references, and the track is built around a looping [[string section]] in unison with a digital processed piano, with other layers gradually being added as the song builds.\n\nThe song was released on 13 June 2008 as the album's second single, debuting to critical acclaim and commercial success. \"Viva la Vida\" reached the top spot of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the band's first number-one single in both the U.S. and U.K. The song won the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] in 2009. The song became the sixth song to reach the 4 million mark in paid downloads in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/41000/week-ending-aug-16-2009-king-of-country-boots-king-of-pop/ |title=Week Ending Aug. 16, 2009: King Of Country Boots King Of Pop \u2013 Chart Watch |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827082907/http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/41000/week-ending-aug-16-2009-king-of-country-boots-king-of-pop |archivedate=27 August 2009 }}</ref> It has sold over 7.1 million copies worldwide by 2014, and over 6 million in the U.S. alone by June 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-june-23-2013-songs-miley-comeback-202517109.html |title=Week Ending June 23, 2013.

All the strings are arranged and conducted by violinist [[Davide Rossi]], who is one of the main collaborators of the album. Rossi's strings comprise the main driving force throughout the song, with a strong beginning loop that supports Martin's voice, until the choruses where the symphonic power of the orchestra takes its fullest shape. The prominent chords played by the string section throughout the song (and in the chorus of \"Rainy Day,\" another of the band's songs) are very similar to those used by \"Viva la Vida\" co-producer Brian Eno in his piece \"An Ending (Ascent),\" meaning they could have been suggested partially for the song by Eno.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]|others=[[Coldplay]]|year=2008|publisher=[[EMI]]|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\nThe song is written in the key of [[A-flat major]]. Its main chord progression is D\u266d/E\u266d/A\u266d/Fm. Time signature is 4/4 and the ''tempo'' is 138.\n\n==Release and promotion==\n\n\"Viva la Vida\" was initially released only with [[iTunes Store]] pre-orders of ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'' on 7 May 2008&nbsp;\u2013 the \"new edit\" version of the song&nbsp;\u2013 which led to the song's temporary exclusion from the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/29511564.html|title=CD Spotlight|last=M.|first=Jon|date=2008-06-20|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|accessdate=2008-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228182826/http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/29511564.html|archive-date=28 December 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was released as a download-only single on 25 May 2008, and a physical CD single in Europe on 29 July 2008 to coincide with the release of the single's music videos. \"Viva la Vida\" was well-downloaded in the internet, becoming iTunes' best-selling song of 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/12/02/coldplay-leona-lewis-top-itunes-2008-sales-chart/|title=Coldplay, Leona Lewis Top iTunes 2008 Sales Chart|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2008-12-02|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref>\n\nThe song was used as part of [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iPod advertising|iPod + iTunes advertisement campaign]].<ref name=\"ew review\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/cdreviews/5840926.html|title=Coldplay channels U2 on new album|last=Guerra|first=Joey|date=2008-06-16|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> Coldplay performed the song live for the first time at the [[2008 MTV Movie Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/06/02/mtv-movie-awards-reunites-wayne-and-garth-honors-transformers/|title=MTV Movie Awards Reunites Wayne and Garth, Features First TV Performance of New Coldplay Single|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2008-06-02|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Jun01/0,4670,MTVMovieAwards,00.html|title=Over-the-top MTV Movie Awards have smoke, no fire|last=Lang|first=Derrick J.|date=2008-06-01|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> It has since gone on to make many media appearances, including being featured throughout the episode [[List of Medium episodes#Season 5: 2009|\"A Person of Interest\"]] from the [[paranormal]] drama ''[[Medium (TV Series)|Medium]]'', as a song played on the radio in the episode \"We're Not in Kansas Anymore\" from the teen drama ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'',<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newsroom.mtv.com/2008/09/03/90210-premiere-how-does-it-compare-to-the-old-bev/|title='90210\u2032 Premiere: How Does It Compare To The Old Bev?|last=Stolz|first=Kim |date=2008-09-03|publisher=MTV|accessdate=2008-11-12}}</ref> used as [[bumper music]] on [[William Bennett|Bill Bennett]]'s \"Morning in America\" radio talk show, and on the international soundtrack to the Brazilian soap opera ''[[A Favorita]]'' which helped push \"Viva la Vida\" up the charts in Brazil, where the telenovela had been shown.<ref name=\"Som Livre\">{{cite web | last = | first =  | url =http://www.somlivre.com/?1430/produto/CD/A-favorita-Internacional/Varios---A-Favorita\n | title =A Favorita Soundtrack  | publisher = A Favorita International Soundtrack | month= | year=2008 }}</ref> In 2009, [[Solange Knowles]] covered the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/promo-42778155-53-20090127-autoplay |title=Pepsi Music |publisher=Music.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> [[Lady Gaga]] also covered the song for [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uFRg2epy-w |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> A live version of the song appeared on Coldplay's 2009 [[live album]] ''[[LeftRightLeftRightLeft]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/05/01/coldplay-reward-fans-with-free-live-lp-leftrightleftrightleft/|title=Coldplay Reward Fans With Free Live LP \"LeftRightLeftRightLeft\"|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2009-05-01|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=2009-05-21}}</ref>\nIt was also used in an episode entitled \"[[Million Dollar Maybe]]\" of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

All the strings are arranged and conducted by violinist [[Davide Rossi]], who is one of the main collaborators of the album. Rossi's strings comprise the main driving force throughout the song, with a strong beginning loop that supports Martin's voice, until the choruses where the symphonic power of the orchestra takes its fullest shape. The prominent chords played by the string section throughout the song (and in the chorus of \"Rainy Day,\" another of the band's songs) are very similar to those used by \"Viva la Vida\" co-producer Brian Eno in his piece \"An Ending (Ascent),\" meaning they could have been suggested partially for the song by Eno.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends]]|others=[[Coldplay]]|year=2008|publisher=[[EMI]]|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\nThe song is written in the key of [[A-flat major]].

MM88 is a deadly [[virus]], created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes, creating a [[pandemic]] initially known as the \"Italian Flu\".\n\nWithin seven months, virtually all the world's population has died off. However, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees [[Celsius]], and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS ''Nereid'' joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempts to make landfall near [[Palmer Station]].\n\nSeveral years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new home, it is discovered that an [[earthquake]] will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States [[nuclear arsenal]].\n\nThe Soviets have [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|their own version]] of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station. After all of the women and children and several hundred of the men are sent to safety aboard an [[icebreaker]],  Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard the ''Nereid'' on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an experimental vaccine.\n\nThe submarine arrives at [[Washington, D.C.]], and Yoshizumi and Carter make a rush for the ARS command bunker. However, they reach the room too late, and all but those aboard the icebreaker perish in the nuclear exchange. Over the course of years Yoshizumi walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1988,<ref>'''Dr. Latour''': We've all had injections of my vaccine against the virus, which is why we have survived the last four years. (English, Kadokawa Shoten, 1980)</ref> he finds the survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed vaccine. They embrace, and Yoshizumi declares \"Life is wonderful.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Masao Kusakari]] as Dr. Sh\u00fbz\u00f4 Yoshizumi{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}}\n* [[Tsunehiko Watase]] as Yasuo Tatsuno\n* [[Sonny Chiba]] as Dr. Yamauchi{{sfn|Mitchell|2001||page=231}}\n* [[Kensaku Morita]] as Ry\u00fbji Sanazawa\n* [[Toshiyuki Nagashima]] as Akimasa Matsuo\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as President Richardson\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Admiral Conway{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}} \n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Senator Barkley{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=114}} \n* [[Chuck Connors]] as Captain McCloud{{sfn|Warren|Thomas|2016|page=617}} \n* [[Bo Svenson]] as Major Carter{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}}\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Marit\n* [[Henry Silva]] as General Garland\n* [[Isao Natsuyagi]] as Commander Nakanishi\n* Stephanie Faulkner as Sarah Baker\n* [[Stuart Gillard]] as Dr. Edward Meyer\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Latour\n* [[George Touliatos]] as Colonel Rankin\n* Chris Wiggins as Dr. Borodinov\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Captain Lopez\n* [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]] as Agent Z\n* [[Ken Pogue]] as Dr. Krause\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Litha\n\n==Background and production==\nIn the 1970s, producer [[Haruki Kadokawa]] formed the [[Kadokawa Daiei Studio|Kadokawa Production Company]]. Its releases included [[Kon Ichikawa]]'s ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' and [[Junya Sato]]'s ''[[Proof of the Man]]'', with the latter having American cast members such as [[George Kennedy]]. Kadokawa began to develop films that were often based on literary properties held by Kadokawa's publishing arm.<ref name=\"midnighteye\">{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/virus.shtml|title=Midnight Eye review: Virus (Fukkatsu no Hi, 1980, Kinji FUKASAKU)|date=9 April 2001|website=[[Midnight Eye]]|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe domestic box-office for these films was large, which led to Kadokawa putting 2 million yen into the film ''Virus'', making it the most expensive film in Japanese history on its release.<ref name=\"midnighteye\"/> The film was shot on location in [[Tokyo]] and various locations throughout [[Canada]], including [[Kleinburg]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. The production was heavily supported by the [[Chilean Navy]], who lent the [[submarine]] [[USS Spot (SS-413)|''Simpson'' (SS-21)]] for use as a filming location. Submarine interiors were filmed on-board [[HMCS Okanagan (S74)|HMCS ''Okanagan'' (S74)]], an [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class]] vessel that served in the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\nDuring filming, a Swedish cruiser used to transport crew was heavily damaged by a coral reef off the Chilean coast, and had to be rescued by the Navy.\n\n==Release==\n''Virus'' was released theatrically in Japan on 28 June 1980 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=323}}\n\nThe American version of the film was shown for review at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1980 as a \"work-in-progress\" print. The non-English language footage was dubbed into English for this release and it ran at 155 minutes. It was initially released to home video in the United States with a 108-minute run-time and was presented on television with a 93-minute running time.

MM88 is a deadly [[virus]], created accidentally by an American geneticist, that amplifies the potency of any other virus or bacterium it comes into contact with. The Americans recover the virus sample, which was stolen from a lab in the US the year before, but the virus is accidentally released after the plane transporting it crashes, creating a [[pandemic]] initially known as the \"Italian Flu\".\n\nWithin seven months, virtually all the world's population has died off. However, the virus is inactive at temperatures below -10 degrees [[Celsius]], and the polar winter has spared the 855 men and eight women stationed in Antarctica. The British nuclear submarine HMS ''Nereid'' joins the scientists after sinking a Soviet submarine whose infected crew attempts to make landfall near [[Palmer Station]].\n\nSeveral years later, as the group is beginning to repopulate their new home, it is discovered that an [[earthquake]] will activate the Automated Reaction System (ARS) and launch the United States [[nuclear arsenal]].\n\nThe Soviets have [[Dead Hand (nuclear war)|their own version]] of the ARS that will fire off their weapons in return, including one targeting Palmer Station. After all of the women and children and several hundred of the men are sent to safety aboard an [[icebreaker]],  Yoshizumi and Major Carter embark aboard the ''Nereid'' on a mission to shut down the ARS, protected from MM88 by an experimental vaccine.\n\nThe submarine arrives at [[Washington, D.C.]], and Yoshizumi and Carter make a rush for the ARS command bunker. However, they reach the room too late, and all but those aboard the icebreaker perish in the nuclear exchange. Over the course of years Yoshizumi walks back towards Antarctica. Upon reaching [[Tierra del Fuego]] in 1988,<ref>'''Dr. Latour''': We've all had injections of my vaccine against the virus, which is why we have survived the last four years. (English, Kadokawa Shoten, 1980)</ref> he finds the survivors from the icebreaker, immunized by a since-developed vaccine. They embrace, and Yoshizumi declares \"Life is wonderful.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Masao Kusakari]] as Dr. Sh\u00fbz\u00f4 Yoshizumi{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}}\n* [[Tsunehiko Watase]] as Yasuo Tatsuno\n* [[Sonny Chiba]] as Dr. Yamauchi{{sfn|Mitchell|2001||page=231}}\n* [[Kensaku Morita]] as Ry\u00fbji Sanazawa\n* [[Toshiyuki Nagashima]] as Akimasa Matsuo\n* [[Glenn Ford]] as President Richardson\n* [[George Kennedy]] as Admiral Conway{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}} \n* [[Robert Vaughn]] as Senator Barkley{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=114}} \n* [[Chuck Connors]] as Captain McCloud{{sfn|Warren|Thomas|2016|page=617}} \n* [[Bo Svenson]] as Major Carter{{sfn|Bolam|Bolam|2011||page=113}}\n* [[Olivia Hussey]] as Marit\n* [[Henry Silva]] as General Garland\n* [[Isao Natsuyagi]] as Commander Nakanishi\n* Stephanie Faulkner as Sarah Baker\n* [[Stuart Gillard]] as Dr. Edward Meyer\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Latour\n* [[George Touliatos]] as Colonel Rankin\n* Chris Wiggins as Dr. Borodinov\n* [[Edward James Olmos]] as Captain Lopez\n* [[Colin Fox (actor)|Colin Fox]] as Agent Z\n* [[Ken Pogue]] as Dr. Krause\n* [[Alberta Watson]] as Litha\n\n==Background and production==\nIn the 1970s, producer [[Haruki Kadokawa]] formed the [[Kadokawa Daiei Studio|Kadokawa Production Company]]. Its releases included [[Kon Ichikawa]]'s ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' and [[Junya Sato]]'s ''[[Proof of the Man]]'', with the latter having American cast members such as [[George Kennedy]]. Kadokawa began to develop films that were often based on literary properties held by Kadokawa's publishing arm.<ref name=\"midnighteye\">{{cite web|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/virus.shtml|title=Midnight Eye review: Virus (Fukkatsu no Hi, 1980, Kinji FUKASAKU)|date=9 April 2001|website=[[Midnight Eye]]|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe domestic box-office for these films was large, which led to Kadokawa putting 2 million yen into the film ''Virus'', making it the most expensive film in Japanese history on its release.<ref name=\"midnighteye\"/> The film was shot on-location in [[Tokyo]] and various locations throughout [[Canada]], including [[Kleinburg]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]]. The production was heavily supported by the [[Chilean Navy]], who lent the [[submarine]] [[USS Spot (SS-413)|''Simpson'' (SS-21)]] for use as a filming location. Submarine interiors were filmed on-board [[HMCS Okanagan (S74)|HMCS ''Okanagan'' (S74)]], an [[Oberon-class submarine|''Oberon''-class]] vessel that served in the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\nDuring filming, a Swedish cruiser used to transport crew was heavily damaged by a coral reef off the Chilean coast, and had to be rescued by the Navy.\n\n==Release==\n''Virus'' was released theatrically in Japan on 28 June 1980 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=323}}\n\nThe American version of the film was shown for review at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in May 1980 as a \"work-in-progress\" print. The non-English language footage was dubbed into English for this release and it ran at 155 minutes. It was initially released to home video in the United States with a 108-minute run-time and was presented on television with a 93-minute running time. The original Japanese-language cut was released to home video in 2006 with English subtitles.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=323}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]''\n* ''[[Contagion (2011 film)|Contagion]]''\n* ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoJ4jTghUPYC&pg=PA678&lpg=PA678&dq=was+robert+vaughn+in+Virus+(1980+film)&source=bl&ots=EFy-iDZDQF&sig=GRVfgUxw8RkW1d21KhZlt3QXs_4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNiYXTw9LQAhXMQCYKHRpRBVcQ6AEIYjAO#v=onepage&q=was%20robert%20vaughn%20in%20Virus%20(1980%20film)&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Fantastic Film: Ali Baba to Zombies|first=R.
