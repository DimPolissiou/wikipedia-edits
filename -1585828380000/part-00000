It involves a juggling act of various demands upon a person relating to [[Employment|work]], [[Interpersonal relationship|social life]], [[family]], [[hobby|hobbies]], personal interests and commitments with the finiteness of time. Using time effectively gives the person \"[[choice]]\" on spending/managing activities at their own time and expediency.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stella Cottrell|title=The Study Skills Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjQdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA122|year=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-28926-1|pages=123+}}</ref> Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques used to [[management|manage]] time when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date. Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually, the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any [[project development]] as it determines the project completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.\n\nThe major themes arising from the literature on time management include the following:\n* Creating an environment conducive to effectiveness\n* Setting the priorities^ \n* The related process of reduction of time spent on non-priorities\n* Implementation of goals\n\n==Related concepts==\n\nTime management is related to different concepts such as:\n* [[Project management]]: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as [[project planning]] and [[Schedule (project management)|project scheduling]]. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.<ref>{{cite book |last=Project Management Institute |year=2004 |title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) |isbn=1-930699-45-X |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoprojectma00proj |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n* [[Attention management]] relates to the management of [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and in particular the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.\n\nOrganizational time management is the science of identifying, valuing and reducing time cost wastage within organizations. It identifies, reports and financially values sustainable time, wasted time and effective time within an organization and develops the business case to convert wasted time into productive time through the funding of products, services, projects or initiatives at a positive return on investment.\n\n== Cultural views of time management ==\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a ''linear time'' view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries such as, Germany, Switzerland, and England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-different-cultures-understand-time-2014-5|title=How Different Cultures Understand Time|last=Communications|first=Richard Lewis, Richard Lewis|website=Business Insider|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management, and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.<ref name=\":0\" /> This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \u201cmonochronic\u201d, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. Generally speaking, this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence, more productive time management.\n\nAnother cultural time view is ''multi-active time'' view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the happier they are.<ref name=\":0\" /> Multi-active cultures are \u201cpolychronic\u201d or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In these cultures, the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last, rather, the focus is on having high-quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/05/different-cultures-see-deadlines-differently|title=Different Cultures See Deadlines Differently|last=Pant|first=Bhaskar|date=2016-05-23|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nA final cultural time view is a ''cyclical time'' view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event-related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence, there is an unlimited amount of it.<ref name=\":0\" /> This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia including Japan, China, and Tibet. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly, therefore, most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have before acting on their plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.\n\n==Creating an effective environment==\nSome{{which|date=July 2013}} time-management literature stresses tasks related to the creation of an environment conducive to \"real\" effectiveness. These strategies include principles such as:\n* \"get organized\" - the [[triage]] of paperwork and of tasks\n* \"protecting one's time\" by insulation, isolation and delegation\n* \"achievement through goal-management and through goal-focus\" - [[motivation]]al emphasis\n* \"recovering from bad time-[[habit]]s\" - [[Recovery model|recovery]] from underlying psychological problems, e.g. [[procrastination]]\n\nIn addition, the timing of tackling tasks is important as tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done in the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed.  Literature{{which|date=July 2013}} also focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as [[procrastination]].\n\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) or [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229084207/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|archive-date=2016-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Hallowell\n| first1                = Edward M.\n| authorlink1           = Edward Hallowell (psychiatrist)\n| last2                 = Ratey\n| first2                = John J.\n| authorlink2           = John Ratey\n| title                 =  Driven To Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=VVhASraP67IC\n| accessdate            = 2013-07-30\n| year                  = 1994\n| publisher             = Touchstone\n| isbn                  =  9780684801285\n| quote                 =\n}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} Some authors{{which|date=July 2013}} focus on the [[prefrontal cortex]] which is the most recently evolved part of the brain. It controls the functions of attention span, impulse control, organization, learning from experience and self-monitoring, among others. Some authors{{howmany|date=July 2013}} argue that changing the way the prefrontal cortex works is possible and offer a solution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/changeyourbrainc00amen_0|title=Change your brain, change your life : the breakthrough program for conquering anxiety, depression, obsessiveness, anger, and impulsiveness|last=Amen, Daniel G.|date=1998|publisher=Times Books|isbn=0-8129-2997-7|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=38752969|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Setting priorities and goals==\n\nTime management strategies are often associated with the recommendation to set personal goals. The literature stresses themes such as:\n* \"Work in [[:wikt:priority|Priority]] Order\" \u2013 [[Goal setting|set goals]] and prioritize\n* \"Set gravitational goals\" \u2013 that attract actions automatically{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThese goals are recorded and may be broken down into a [[project management|project]], an [[action plan]], or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list or a schedule or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly or other planning period associated with a different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows.\n\n===ABCD analysis===\nA technique that has been used in [[business management]] for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, and C\u2014hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:\n* '''A''' \u2013 Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,\n* '''B''' \u2013 Tasks that are important but not urgent,\n* '''C''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,\n* '''D''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.\nEach group is then rank-ordered by priority. To further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all \"B\" items as either \"A\" or \"C\". ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups.<ref name=Lakein>{{Cite book\n| publisher = P.H.

This principle is used to sort tasks into two parts. According to this form of [[Pareto analysis]] it is recommended that tasks that fall into the first category be assigned a higher priority.{{Clarify|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe [[Pareto principle|80-20-rule]] can also be applied to increase productivity: it is assumed that 80% of the productivity can be achieved by doing 20% of the tasks.

Eisenhower]]. Note, however, that Eisenhower seems to say that things are never both important and urgent, or neither: So he has two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.\n\n=== POSEC method ===\n\nPOSEC is an acronym for \"Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing\". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one's personal responsibilities first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.time-management-abilities.com/posec-method.html|title=The POSEC Method Of Time Management|website=Time-Management-Abilities.com|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nInherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]]:\n# '''P'''rioritize \u2013 Your time and define your life by goals.\n# '''O'''rganize \u2013 Things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances).\n# '''S'''treamline \u2013 Things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores).\n# '''E'''conomize \u2013 Things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing).\n# '''C'''ontribute \u2013 By paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations).\n\n==Elimination of non-priorities==\n\nTime management also covers how to eliminate tasks that do not provide value to the individual or organization.\n\nAccording to Sandberg,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|title=To-Do Lists Can Take More Time Than Doing, But That Isn't the Point|first=Jared|last=Sandberg|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2004-09-08|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213818/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|archive-date=2018-04-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 a report on to-do lists and the people who make them and use them</ref> task lists \"aren't the key to productivity [that] they're cracked up to be\".

It is an [[inventory]] tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to [[memory]].\n\nTask lists are used in self-management,<!--needs disambiguation before creating a link to this term, as the current article for self-management is out of context for this article--> [[management|business management]], [[project management]], and [[software development]].

There are also several web-based task list applications, many of which are free.\n\n=== Task list organization ===\n\nTask lists are often diarised and tiered. The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list (or task-holding file) to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish, and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list. An alternative is to create a \"not-to-do list\", to avoid unnecessary tasks.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n\nTask lists are often prioritized:\n* A daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance, and done in that order one at a time until daily time allows, is attributed to consultant [[Ivy Lee]] (1877\u20131934) as the most profitable advice received by [[Charles M.

In his system \"A\" items were the most important (\"A-1\" the most important within that group), \"B\" next most important, \"C\" least important.<ref name=Lakein />\n* A particular method of applying the ''ABC method''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|title=Time Scheduling and Time Management for dyslexic students|work=Dyslexia at College|accessdate=October 31, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026082426/http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|archive-date=2005-10-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 ABC lists and tips for [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] students on how to manage to-do lists</ref> assigns \"A\" to tasks to be done within a [[day]], \"B\" a [[week]], and \"C\" a [[month]].\n* To prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest [[:wikt:priority|priority]], or assigns them a [[number]] after they are listed (\"1\" for highest priority, \"2\" for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n* Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks (group A) is to put the most unpleasant one first. When it's done, the rest of the list feels easier. Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea, but instead of doing the first task (which is the most unpleasant) right away, it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first one.\n* A completely different approach which argues ''against'' prioritising altogether was put forward by British author [[Mark Forster (author)|Mark Forster]] in his book \"Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\". This is based on the idea of operating \"closed\" to-do lists, instead of the traditional \"open\" to-do list. He argues that the traditional never-ending to-do lists virtually guarantees that some of your work will be left undone. This approach advocates getting all your work done, every day, and if you are unable to achieve it helps you diagnose where you are going wrong and what needs to change.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Hodder & Stoughton Religious\n| isbn = 0-340-90912-9\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224 224]\n| last = Forster\n| first = Mark\n| authorlink = Mark Forster (author)\n| title = Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\n| date = 2006-07-20\n| url = https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following:\n* Management of the list can take over from implementing it. This could be caused by [[procrastination]] by prolonging the planning activity. This is akin to [[analysis paralysis]]. As with any activity, there's a point of diminishing returns.\n* To remain flexible, a task system must allow for disaster. A company must be ready for a disaster. Even if it is a small disaster, if no one made time for this situation, it can [[Metastasis|metastasize]], potentially causing damage to the company.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York ''The CEO Paradox (1992)''</ref>\n* To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires.<ref>\"Tyranny of the Urgent\" essay by Charles Hummel 1967</ref>\n* If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals, the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans, like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| title=86 Experts Reveal Their Best Time Management Tips| accessdate=March 3, 2017| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123713/https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| archivedate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Software applications ===\n\nMany companies use [[time tracking software]] to track an employee's working time, billable hours etc., e.g. [[law practice management software]].\n\nMany software products for time management support multiple users. They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communication.\n\nTask list applications may be thought of as lightweight [[personal information manager]] or [[project management software]].\n\nModern task list [[software application|applications]] may have built-in task hierarchy (tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|title=ToDoList 5.9.2 - A simple but effective way to keep on top of your tasks - The Code Project - Free Tools|work=ToDoList 5.9.2|accessdate=October 3, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122052326/http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|archivedate=November 22, 2008}} \u2014 Features, code, and description for ToDoList 5.3.9, a project-based time management application</ref> may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks, and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each task.\n\nIn contrast to the concept of allowing the person to use multiple filtering methods, at least one software product additionally contains a mode where the software will attempt to dynamically determine the best tasks for any given moment.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| publisher=Gaea News Network| last=Partho| date=18 February 2009| title=Top 10 Time Management Software for Windows| accessdate=October 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112000920/http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| archive-date=2017-01-12| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Time management systems===\n\nTime management systems often include a [[time clock]] or web-based application used to track an employee's work hours. Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce, allowing them to see, plan and manage employees' time. Doing so allows employers to control labor costs and increase productivity. A time management system automates processes, which eliminates paper work and tedious tasks.\n\n===GTD (Getting Things Done)===\n[[Getting Things Done]] was created by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the [[information overload]] or \"brain freeze\" which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they're easy to manage and see.\n\n===Pomodoro===\nFrancesco Cirillo's \"[[Pomodoro Technique]]\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a pomodoro (Italian for tomato) shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros. Through experimentation involving various work groups and mentoring activities, Cirillo determined the \"ideal Pomodoro\" to be 20\u201335 minutes long.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cirillo|first1=Francesco|title=The Pomodoro Technique|date=November 14, 2009|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1445219943}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Action item]]\n* [[African time]]\n* [[Attention management]]\n* [[Calendaring software]]\n* [[Chronemics]]\n* [[Flow (psychology)]]\n* [[Gantt chart]]\n* [[Goal setting]]\n* [[Interruption science]]\n* [[Maestro concept]]\n* [[Opportunity cost]]\n* [[Order (virtue)|Order]]\n* [[Polychronicity]]\n* [[Precommitment]]\n* [[Procrastination]]\n* [[Professional organizing]]\n* [[Prospective memory]]\n* [[Punctuality]]\n* [[Self-help]]\n* [[Time and attendance]]\n* [[Time perception]]\n* [[Time to completion]]\n* [[Time value of money]]\n* [[Work activity management]]\n* [[Workforce management]]\n* [[Workforce modeling]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n'''Book''':\n* [[The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]]\n\n'''Systems''':\n* [[Getting Things Done]]\n* [[Pomodoro Technique]]\n\n'''Psychology/neuroscience'''\n* [[Habit]]\n* [[Self-control]]\n* [[Impulsivity]]\n* [[Inhibitory control]]\n\n'''Psychiatry'''\n* [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box}}\n* {{Cite book\n|publisher = Viking\n| isbn = 978-0-670-88906-8\n| last = Allen\n| first = David\n| title = Getting things done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity\n| location = New York\n| year = 2001\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Penguin Group\n| isbn = 978-1-58542-552-5\n| last = Fiore\n| first = Neil A\n| title = The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt- Free Play\n| location = New York\n| year = 2006\n| url = https://archive.org/details/nowhabitstrategi00fior_0\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| publisher = Cranendonck Coaching\n| isbn = 978-90-79397-03-7\n| last = Le Blanc\n| first = Raymond\n| title = Achieving Objectives Made Easy!

Initially, time management referred to just business or work activities, but eventually the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any [[project development]] as it determines the project completion time and scope. It is also important to understand that both technical and structural differences in time management exist due to variations in cultural concepts of time.\n\nThe major themes arising from the literature on time management include the following:\n* Creating an environment conducive to effectiveness\n* Setting of priorities\n* The related process of reduction of time spent on non-priorities\n* Implementation of goals\n\n==Related concepts==\n\nTime management is related to different concepts such as:\n* [[Project management]]: Time management can be considered to be a project management subset and is more commonly known as [[project planning]] and [[Schedule (project management)|project scheduling]]. Time management has also been identified as one of the core functions identified in project management.<ref>{{cite book |last=Project Management Institute |year=2004 |title=A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK Guide) |isbn=1-930699-45-X |url=https://archive.org/details/guidetoprojectma00proj |url-status=dead |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n* [[Attention management]] relates to the management of [[cognition|cognitive]] resources, and in particular the time that humans allocate their mind (and organize the minds of their employees) to conduct some activities.\n\nOrganizational time management is the science of identifying, valuing and reducing time cost wastage within organizations. It identifies, reports and financially values sustainable time, wasted time and effective time within an organization and develops the business case to convert wasted time into productive time through the funding of products, services, projects or initiatives at a positive return on investment.\n\n== Cultural views of time management ==\nDifferences in the way a culture views time can affect the way their time is managed. For example, a ''linear time'' view is a way of conceiving time as flowing from one moment to the next in a linear fashion. This linear perception of time is predominant in America along with most Northern European countries such as, Germany, Switzerland, and England.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-different-cultures-understand-time-2014-5|title=How Different Cultures Understand Time|last=Communications|first=Richard Lewis, Richard Lewis|website=Business Insider|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> People in these cultures tend to place a large value on productive time management, and tend to avoid decisions or actions that would result in wasted time.<ref name=\":0\" /> This linear view of time correlates to these cultures being more \u201cmonochronic\u201d, or preferring to do only one thing at a time. Generally speaking, this cultural view leads to a better focus on accomplishing a singular task and hence, more productive time management.\n\nAnother cultural time view is ''multi-active time'' view. In multi-active cultures, most people feel that the more activities or tasks being done at once the happier they are.<ref name=\":0\" /> Multi-active cultures are \u201cpolychronic\u201d or prefer to do multiple tasks at once. This multi-active time view is prominent in most Southern European countries such as Spain, Portugal, and Italy.<ref name=\":0\" /> In these cultures, the people often tend to spend time on things they deem to be more important such as placing a high importance on finishing social conversations.<ref name=\":0\" /> In business environments, they often pay little attention to how long meetings last, rather, the focus is on having high quality meetings. In general, the cultural focus tends to be on synergy and creativity over efficiency.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2016/05/different-cultures-see-deadlines-differently|title=Different Cultures See Deadlines Differently|last=Pant|first=Bhaskar|date=2016-05-23|website=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref>\n\nA final cultural time view is a ''cyclical time'' view. In cyclical cultures, time is considered neither linear nor event related. Because days, months, years, seasons, and events happen in regular repetitive occurrences, time is viewed as cyclical. In this view, time is not seen as wasted because it will always come back later, hence, there is an unlimited amount of it.<ref name=\":0\" /> This cyclical time view is prevalent throughout most countries in Asia including Japan, China, and Tibet. It is more important in cultures with cyclical concepts of time to complete tasks correctly, therefore, most people will spend more time thinking about decisions and the impact they will have before acting on their plans.<ref name=\":1\" /> Most people in cyclical cultures tend to understand that other cultures have different perspectives of time and are cognizant of this when acting on a global stage.\n\n==Creating an effective environment==\nSome{{which|date=July 2013}} time-management literature stresses tasks related to the creation of an environment conducive to \"real\" effectiveness. These strategies include principles such as:\n* \"get organized\" - the [[triage]] of paperwork and of tasks\n* \"protecting one's time\" by insulation, isolation and delegation\n* \"achievement through goal-management and through goal-focus\" - [[motivation]]al emphasis\n* \"recovering from bad time-[[habit]]s\" - [[Recovery model|recovery]] from underlying psychological problems, e.g. [[procrastination]]\n\nIn addition, the timing of tackling tasks is important as tasks requiring high levels of concentration and mental energy are often done in the beginning of the day when a person is more refreshed.  Literature{{which|date=July 2013}} also focuses on overcoming chronic psychological issues such as [[procrastination]].\n\nExcessive and chronic inability to manage time effectively may result from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) or [[attention deficit disorder]] (ADD).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|title=NIMH \u00bb Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229084207/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd/index.shtml|archive-date=2016-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref> Diagnostic criteria include a sense of underachievement, difficulty getting organized, trouble getting started, trouble managing many simultaneous projects, and trouble with follow-through.<ref>\n{{cite book\n| last1                 = Hallowell\n| first1                = Edward M.\n| authorlink1           = Edward Hallowell (psychiatrist)\n| last2                 = Ratey\n| first2                = John J.\n| authorlink2           = John Ratey\n| title                 =  Driven To Distraction: Recognizing and Coping with Attention Deficit Disorder from Childhood Through Adulthood\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=VVhASraP67IC\n| accessdate            = 2013-07-30\n| year                  = 1994\n| publisher             = Touchstone\n| isbn                  =  9780684801285\n| quote                 =\n}}\n</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} Some authors{{which|date=July 2013}} focus on the [[prefrontal cortex]] which is the most recently evolved part of the brain.

The literature stresses themes such as:\n* \"Work in [[:wikt:priority|Priority]] Order\" \u2013 [[Goal setting|set goals]] and prioritize\n* \"Set gravitational goals\" \u2013 that attract actions automatically{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThese goals are recorded and may be broken down into a [[project management|project]], an [[action plan]], or a simple task list. For individual tasks or for goals, an importance rating may be established, deadlines may be set, and priorities assigned. This process results in a plan with a task list or a schedule or calendar of activities. Authors may recommend a daily, weekly, monthly or other planning periods associated with different scope of planning or review. This is done in various ways, as follows.\n\n===ABCD analysis===\nA technique that has been used in [[business management]] for a long time is the categorization of large data into groups. These groups are often marked A, B, and C\u2014hence the name. Activities are ranked by these general criteria:\n* '''A''' \u2013 Tasks that are perceived as being urgent and important,\n* '''B''' \u2013 Tasks that are important but not urgent,\n* '''C''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant but urgent,\n* '''D''' \u2013 Tasks that are unimportant and not urgent.\nEach group is then rank-ordered by priority. To further refine the prioritization, some individuals choose to then force-rank all \"B\" items as either \"A\" or \"C\". ABC analysis can incorporate more than three groups.<ref name=Lakein>{{Cite book\n| publisher = P.H.

Eisenhower]]. Note, however, that Eisenhower seems to say that things are never both important and urgent, or neither: So he has two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important.\n\n=== POSEC method ===\n\nPOSEC is an acronym for \"Prioritize by Organizing, Streamlining, Economizing and Contributing\". The method dictates a template which emphasizes an average individual's immediate sense of emotional and monetary security. It suggests that by attending to one's personal responsibilities first, an individual is better positioned to shoulder collective responsibilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.time-management-abilities.com/posec-method.html|title=The POSEC Method Of Time Management|website=Time-Management-Abilities.com|access-date=2019-08-29}}</ref>\n\nInherent in the acronym is a hierarchy of self-realization, which mirrors [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of needs]]:\n# '''P'''rioritize \u2013 Your time and define your life by goals.\n# '''O'''rganize \u2013 Things you have to accomplish regularly to be successful (family and finances).\n# '''S'''treamline \u2013 Things you may not like to do, but must do (work and chores).\n# '''E'''conomize \u2013 Things you should do or may even like to do, but they're not pressingly urgent (pastimes and socializing).\n# '''C'''ontribute \u2013 By paying attention to the few remaining things that make a difference (social obligations).\n\n==Elimination of non-priorities==\n\nTime management also covers how to eliminate tasks that do not provide value to the individual or organization.\n\nAccording to Sandberg,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|title=To-Do Lists Can Take More Time Than Doing, But That Isn't the Point|first=Jared|last=Sandberg|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2004-09-08|access-date=2018-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213818/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109460145618411891|archive-date=2018-04-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 a report on to-do lists and the people who make them and use them</ref> task lists \"aren't the key to productivity [that] they're cracked up to be\".

It is an unnecessary cost or a false aspect that can interfere with plans due to human factors. The Eisenhower Method is a strategy used to compete worry and dull-imperative tasks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Phillip Brown|title=26 Words That Can Change Your Life: Nurture Your Mind, Heart and Soul to Transform Your Life and Relationships|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb1WDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT76|year=2014|publisher=BookB|isbn=978-0-9939006-0-0|pages=76\u2013}}</ref> Worry as stress, is a reaction to a set of environmental factors; understanding this is not a part of the person gives the person possibilities to manage them.

To eliminate non-priorities in study time it is suggested to divide the tasks, capture the moments, review task handling method, postpone unimportant tasks (understood by its current relevancy and sense of urgency reflects wants of the person rather than importance), control life balance (rest, sleep, leisure), and cheat leisure and non productive time (hearing audio taping of lectures, going through presentations of lectures when in queue, etc.).<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard Walsh|title=Time Management: Proven Techniques for Making Every Minute Count|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B7frDQAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=978-1-4405-0113-5|pages=161\u2013163}}</ref>\n\nCertain unnecessary factors that affect time management are habits, lack of task definition (lack of clarity), over-protectiveness of the work, guilt of not meeting objectives and subsequent avoidance of present tasks, defining tasks with higher expectations than their worth (over-qualifying), focusing on matters that have an apparent positive outlook without assessing their importance to personal needs, tasks that require support and time, sectional interests and conflicts, etc.<ref>{{cite book|author=Patrick Forsyth|title=Successful Time Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3OGJflNd8HoC|year=2013|publisher=Kogan Page Publishers|isbn=978-0-7494-6723-4|pages=90\u201393}}</ref> A habituated systematic process becomes a device that the person can use with ownership for effective time management.\n\n==Implementation of goals==\n{{Redirect|To do|the auxiliary use of the verb \"to do\" in the English language|Do-support}}\n{{See also|shopping list}}[[File:My to do list is healed and in use! (4668030838).jpg|thumb|A to-do form with [[checkboxes]] [[tattoo]]ed into a person's arm. Some items have been written out with a black pen.]]\nA '''task list''' (also called a '''to-do list''' or \"things-to-do\") is a list of [[Task (project management)|tasks]] to be completed, such as chores or steps toward completing a project. It is an [[inventory]] tool which serves as an alternative or supplement to [[memory]].\n\nTask lists are used in self-management,<!--needs disambiguation before creating a link to this term, as the current article for self-management is out of context for this article--> [[management|business management]], [[project management]], and [[software development]]. It may involve more than one list.\n\nWhen one of the items on a task list is accomplished, the task is [[checkmark|checked]] or [[cross]]ed off. The traditional method is to write these on a piece of paper with a [[pen]] or [[pencil]], usually on a note pad or clip-board. Task lists can also have the form of paper or software [[checklist]]s.\n\nWriter Julie Morgenstern suggests \"do's and don'ts\" of time management that include:\n* Map out everything that is important, by making a task list.\n* Create \"an oasis of time\" for one to control.\n* Say \"No\".\n* Set priorities.\n* Don't drop everything.\n* Don't think a critical task will get done in one's [[spare time]].<ref name=Morgenstern>{{Cite book\n| edition = 2nd\n| publisher = Henry Holt/Owl Books\n| isbn = 0-8050-7590-9\n| pages = 285\n| last = Morgenstern\n| first = Julie\n| title = Time Management from the Inside Out: The Foolproof System for Taking Control of Your Schedule\u2014and Your Life\n| location = New York\n| year = 2004\n}}</ref>\n\nNumerous digital equivalents are now available, including [[personal information management]] (PIM) applications and most [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. There are also several web-based task list applications, many of which are free.\n\n=== Task list organization ===\n\nTask lists are often diarised and tiered. The simplest tiered system includes a general to-do list (or task-holding file) to record all the tasks the person needs to accomplish, and a daily to-do list which is created each day by transferring tasks from the general to-do list. An alternative is to create a \"not-to-do list\", to avoid unnecessary tasks.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n\nTask lists are often prioritized:\n* A daily list of things to do, numbered in the order of their importance, and done in that order one at a time until daily time allows, is attributed to consultant [[Ivy Lee]] (1877\u20131934) as the most profitable advice received by [[Charles M.

In his system \"A\" items were the most important (\"A-1\" the most important within that group), \"B\" next most important, \"C\" least important.<ref name=Lakein />\n* A particular method of applying the ''ABC method''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|title=Time Scheduling and Time Management for dyslexic students|work=Dyslexia at College|accessdate=October 31, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051026082426/http://www.dyslexia-college.com/schedule.html|archive-date=2005-10-26|url-status=live}} \u2014 ABC lists and tips for [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] students on how to manage to-do lists</ref> assigns \"A\" to tasks to be done within a [[day]], \"B\" a [[week]], and \"C\" a [[month]].\n* To prioritize a daily task list, one either records the tasks in the order of highest [[:wikt:priority|priority]], or assigns them a [[number]] after they are listed (\"1\" for highest priority, \"2\" for second highest priority, etc.) which indicates in which order to execute the tasks. The latter method is generally faster, allowing the tasks to be recorded more quickly.<ref name=Morgenstern />\n* Another way of prioritizing compulsory tasks (group A) is to put the most unpleasant one first. When it's done, the rest of the list feels easier. Groups B and C can benefit from the same idea, but instead of doing the first task (which is the most unpleasant) right away, it gives motivation to do other tasks from the list to avoid the first one.\n* A completely different approach which argues ''against'' prioritising altogether was put forward by British author [[Mark Forster (author)|Mark Forster]] in his book \"Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\". This is based on the idea of operating \"closed\" to-do lists, instead of the traditional \"open\" to-do list. He argues that the traditional never-ending to-do lists virtually guarantees that some of your work will be left undone. This approach advocates getting all your work done, every day, and if you are unable to achieve it helps you diagnose where you are going wrong and what needs to change.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = Hodder & Stoughton Religious\n| isbn = 0-340-90912-9\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224 224]\n| last = Forster\n| first = Mark\n| authorlink = Mark Forster (author)\n| title = Do It Tomorrow and Other Secrets of Time Management\n| date = 2006-07-20\n| url = https://archive.org/details/doittomorrowothe0000fors/page/224\n}}</ref>\n\nVarious writers have stressed potential difficulties with to-do lists such as the following:\n* Management of the list can take over from implementing it. This could be caused by [[procrastination]] by prolonging the planning activity. This is akin to [[analysis paralysis]]. As with any activity, there's a point of diminishing returns.\n* To remain flexible, a task system must allow for disaster. A company must be ready for a disaster. Even if it is a small disaster, if no one made time for this situation, it can [[Metastasis|metastasize]], potentially causing damage to the company.<ref>Horton, Thomas. New York ''The CEO Paradox (1992)''</ref>\n* To avoid getting stuck in a wasteful pattern, the task system should also include regular (monthly, semi-annual, and annual) planning and system-evaluation sessions, to weed out inefficiencies and ensure the user is headed in the direction he or she truly desires.<ref>\"Tyranny of the Urgent\" essay by Charles Hummel 1967</ref>\n* If some time is not regularly spent on achieving long-range goals, the individual may get stuck in a perpetual holding pattern on short-term plans, like staying at a particular job much longer than originally planned.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| title=86 Experts Reveal Their Best Time Management Tips| accessdate=March 3, 2017| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303123713/https://www.adaptrm.com/blog/time-management/| archivedate=March 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Software applications ===\n\nMany companies use [[time tracking software]] to track an employee's working time, billable hours etc., e.g. [[law practice management software]].\n\nMany software products for time management support multiple users. They allow the person to give tasks to other users and use the software for communication.\n\nTask list applications may be thought of as lightweight [[personal information manager]] or [[project management software]].\n\nModern task list [[software application|applications]] may have built-in task hierarchy (tasks are composed of subtasks which again may contain subtasks),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|title=ToDoList 5.9.2 - A simple but effective way to keep on top of your tasks - The Code Project - Free Tools|work=ToDoList 5.9.2|accessdate=October 3, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122052326/http://www.codeproject.com/tools/ToDoList2.asp|archivedate=November 22, 2008}} \u2014 Features, code, and description for ToDoList 5.3.9, a project-based time management application</ref> may support multiple methods of filtering and ordering the list of tasks, and may allow one to associate arbitrarily long notes for each task.\n\nIn contrast to the concept of allowing the person to use multiple filtering methods, at least one software product additionally contains a mode where the software will attempt to dynamically determine the best tasks for any given moment.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| publisher=Gaea News Network| last=Partho| date=18 February 2009| title=Top 10 Time Management Software for Windows| accessdate=October 9, 2016| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112000920/http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/top-10-time-management-software-for-windows/| archive-date=2017-01-12| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Time management systems===\n\nTime management systems often include a [[time clock]] or web-based application used to track an employee's work hours. Time management systems give employers insights into their workforce, allowing them to see, plan and manage employees' time. Doing so allows employers to control labor costs and increase productivity. A time management system automates processes, which eliminates paper work and tedious tasks.\n\n===GTD (Getting Things Done)===\n[[Getting Things Done]] was created by [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]. The basic idea behind this method is to finish all the small tasks immediately and a big task is to be divided into smaller tasks to start completing now. The reasoning behind this is to avoid the [[information overload]] or \"brain freeze\" which is likely to occur when there are hundreds of tasks. The thrust of GTD is to encourage the user to get their tasks and ideas out and on paper and organized as quickly as possible so they're easy to manage and see.\n\n===Pomodoro===\nFrancesco Cirillo's \"[[Pomodoro Technique]]\" was originally conceived in the late 1980s and gradually refined until it was later defined in 1992. The technique is the namesake of a pomodoro (Italian for tomato) shaped kitchen timer initially used by Cirillo during his time at university. The \"Pomodoro\" is described as the fundamental metric of time within the technique and is traditionally defined as being 30 minutes long, consisting of 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of break time. Cirillo also recommends a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes after every four Pomodoros.

This book is a seminal work which discusses how [[contract theory]] continues to affirm the [[patriarchy]] through methods of [[contract]]ual submission where there is ultimately a power imbalance from systemic sexism.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=16\u201318}}</ref> The focus of the ''The Sexual Contract'' is on the false narrative that there is a post-patriarchal or anti-patriarchal society that presently exists as a result of the conception of a civil society, instead Pateman argues that civil society continues to aid feminine oppression and that the orthodoxy of contracts such as [[marriage]] cannot become equitable to both women and men. Pateman uses a feminist lens when rationalising the argument proposed in ''The Sexual Contract'' through the use of works by classic political and liberal philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and later interpreted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] whom Pateman has before critiqued for on how modern rights, freedoms are derived from archaic standards of contract that are deeply embedded within [[Western world|Western Spheres]] particularly America, England and Australia which are the focus areas for her work . \u00a0\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Carole Pateman}}\nCarole Pateman when writing ''The Sexual Contract'' used her previous background in political theory as support to substantiate a feminist commentary and critique on the nature of contracts as tools to control womanhood establishing how \"the original contract constitutes men's freedom and women's subjection\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=Sophie|title=The Sexual Contract by Carole Pateman Review by: Sophie Watson|publisher=Feminist Review No. 33//Sage Publications, Ltd.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}</ref> Pateman writes within the confines of the [[Western world|Western Tradition]] which presents both how this tradition excludes women and how it fundamentally supported female oppression in western political and legal thought.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Boucher|first=Joanne|title=Male Power and Contract Theory: Hobbes and Locke in Carole Pateman\u2019s The Sexual Contract|publisher=Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue canadienne de science politique.|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}</ref> Pateman elucidates how ''The Sexual Contract'' as a theory is rooted in how the [[Age of Enlightenment|period of enlightenment]] was essentially led by men for the liberation of men with the quote [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]] excluding the liberation of women through language used within this period, effectively fashioning the beginnings of modern patriarchy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=125}}</ref> Pateman voices this in order to demonstrate her point that social contracts based upon these ideas of liberty are inherently skewed to favor the sex-right of men and the subordination of women to sustain social contract therefore becoming a sexual contract which inhibits the autonomy of women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n''The Sexual Contract'' is divided into eight chapters, Pateman utilizes 'feminist storytelling' structures to illustrate contract theory from its origins to its contemporary implications. Pateman displays how contracts affect womanhood in a multitude of ways such as economic and sexual capitalisation that is exploited from women through marriage, [[prostitution]] and [[prostitution|surrogacy]].<ref>Dietz, MG 2016, Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract. in JT Levy (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Classics in Contemporary Political Theory .'' <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198717133.013.12</nowiki></ref> ''The Sexual Contract'' reveals the complications associated with contract theory and how \"Feminists therefore cannot \"reform\" those parts of political theory, they must start anew and from scratch\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Shanley|first=Mary Lyndon|title=Manhood and Politics: A Feminist Reading in Political Theory by Wendy Brown; The Sexual Contract by Carole Pateman|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=Autumn 1990|isbn=|location=|pages=185}}</ref> The articulation throughout the book is that Contractarian Theory cannot be amended in a progressive manner, Contracts always initiates a political right entailing an intrinsically dominant and subordinate party. Moreover, ''The Sexual Contract'' explores how the basis of western society is built upon the contractual oppression of women in order to uphold a patriarchal regime, depicting how in the wake of social contract between enlightened men there exists \"another contract, the sexual contract, by which men gain possession of women.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Marriage ====\nPateman pays close attention to the contract obligations associated with marriage, \"Women are incorporated into society via the marriage contract but they may enter such a contract not as equal individuals but as natural subordinate\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=Sophie|title=Feminist Review, No. 33|publisher=Sage Publications, Ltd.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=107}}</ref> Marriage acts as a way to gain \"sexual access\" to a woman's body and the \"labour\" she provides as a wife\"<ref name=\":1\" /> it is regarded as a major institution in society  \"the institution of marriage gives each husband the capacity, if he so wishes, to ill-treat his wife.\"<ref name=\":4\">Thompson, Sharon et al.

The surrogacy contract is another facet of the sexual contract providing a new form of access to women's bodies, the issue within the surrogacy contract is its issues are inherently class-based wherein working-class women are attracted to the financial aspect of this contract but are ultimately unequal to the party that benefits from the time and nature of the service they are providing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=323}}</ref> Pateman uses the words of Locke as an example on the differences between a surrogacy contract and prostitution contract where although men don't use direct sexual use of a woman's body for surrogacy, the 'mixing of the man's seed' with the 'woman's uterus' if performed 'faithfully' results in a child essentially owned by the male party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=326}}</ref> Patemans argues the intervention of women within civil society demonstrates how the surrogacy contract remains a part of a dependence on female sexuality and how it is not the discretion of the woman which is valued in the contract but instead her body which is used by society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=340}}</ref>\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe Sexual Contract concludes with Pateman stating how the original contract is a political fiction that belongs to modern patriarchy, there is no true origin to the original contract instead it exists as a progression to liberty but only the liberty of certain individuals.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=334}}</ref> The crux of the issue as outlined by Pateman is that political and legal liberty need to be told from a perspective different from a traditionalist one, Pateman seeks in her work to elaborate more thoroughly on the issues with civil society and how it cannot be established as equal because of its patriarchal origins it instead must be dismissed and re-established to become equitable between the sexes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=339\u2013341}}</ref> Women can never truly become individuals because their bodies cannot be forgotten by their male counterparts, a contract between men and women is influenced because of the ideal of embodied feminine beings which can never truly exist as individuals like men can with civil society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=340}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Sexual Contract'' received the 2005 Benjamin E.

This book is a seminal work which discusses how [[contract theory]] continues to affirm the [[patriarchy]] through methods of [[contract]]ual submission where there is ultimately a power imbalance from systemic sexism.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=16\u201318}}</ref> The focus of the ''The Sexual Contract'' is on the false narrative that there is a post-patriarchal or anti-patriarchal society that presently exists as a result of the conception of a civil society, instead Pateman argues that civil society continues to aid feminine oppression and that the orthodoxy of contracts such as [[marriage]] cannot become equitable to both women and men. Pateman uses a feminist lens when rationalising the argument proposed in ''The Sexual Contract'' through the use of works by classic political and liberal philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and later interpreted by the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] whom Pateman has before critiqued for on how modern rights, freedoms are derived from archaic standards of contract that are deeply embedded within [[Western world|Western Spheres]] particularly America, England and Australia which are the focus areas for her work . \u00a0\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Carole Pateman}}\nCarole Pateman when writing ''The Sexual Contract'' used her previous background in political theory as support to substantiate a feminist commentary and critique on the nature of contracts as tools to control womanhood establishing how \"the original contract constitutes men's freedom and women's subjection\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=Sophie|title=The Sexual Contract by Carole Pateman Review by: Sophie Watson|publisher=Feminist Review No. 33//Sage Publications, Ltd.|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=106}}</ref> Pateman writes within the confines of the [[Western world|Western Tradition]] which presents both how this tradition excludes women and how it fundamentally supported female oppression in western political and legal thought.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Boucher|first=Joanne|title=Male Power and Contract Theory: Hobbes and Locke in Carole Pateman\u2019s The Sexual Contract|publisher=Canadian Journal of Political Science/Revue canadienne de science politique.|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=35}}</ref> Pateman elucidates how ''The Sexual Contract'' as a theory is rooted in how the [[Age of Enlightenment|period of enlightenment]] was essentially led by men for the liberation of men with the quote [[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]] excluding the liberation of women through language used within this period, effectively fashioning the beginnings of modern patriarchy.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=125}}</ref> Pateman voices this in order to demonstrate her point that social contracts based upon these ideas of liberty are inherently skewed to favor the sex-right of men and the subordination of women to sustain social contract therefore becoming a sexual contract which inhibits the autonomy of women.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=12\u201313}}</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n''The Sexual Contract'' is divided into eight chapters, Pateman utilizes 'feminist storytelling' structures to illustrate contract theory from its origins to its contemporary implications. Pateman displays how contracts affect womanhood in a multitude of ways such as economic and sexual capitalisation that is exploited from women through marriage, [[prostitution]] and [[prostitution|surrogacy]].<ref>Dietz, MG 2016, Carole Pateman, The Sexual Contract. in JT Levy (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Classics in Contemporary Political Theory .'' <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198717133.013.12</nowiki></ref> ''The Sexual Contract'' reveals the complications associated with contract theory and how \"Feminists therefore cannot \"reform\" those parts of political theory, they must start anew and from scratch\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Shanley|first=Mary Lyndon|title=Manhood and Politics: A Feminist Reading in Political Theory by Wendy Brown; The Sexual Contract by Carole Pateman|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=Autumn 1990|isbn=|location=|pages=185}}</ref> The articulation throughout the book is that Contractarian Theory cannot be amended in a progressive manner, Contracts always initiates a political right entailing an intrinsically dominant and subordinate party.

The surrogacy contract is another facet of the sexual contract providing a new form of access to women's bodies, the issue within the surrogacy contract is its issues are inherently class-based wherein working-class women are attracted to the financial aspect of this contract but are ultimately unequal to the party that benefits from the time and nature of the service they are providing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=323}}</ref> Pateman uses the words of Locke as an example on the differences between a surrogacy contract and prostitution contract where although men don't use direct sexual use of a woman's body for surrogacy, the 'mixing of the man's seed' with the 'woman's uterus' if performed 'faithfully' results in a child essentially owned by the male party.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=326}}</ref> Patemans argues the intervention of women within civil society demonstrates how the surrogacy contract remains a part of a dependence on female sexuality and how it is not the discretion of the woman which is valued in the contract but instead her body which is used by society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=340}}</ref>\n\n==== Conclusion ====\nThe Sexual Contract concludes with Pateman stating how the original contract is a political fiction that belongs to modern patriarchy, there is no true origin to the original contract instead it exists as a progression to liberty but only the liberty of certain individuals.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=334}}</ref> The crux of the issue as outlined by Pateman is that political and legal liberty need to be told from a perspective different from a traditionalist one, Pateman seeks in her work to elaborate more thoroughly on the issues with civil society and how it cannot be established as equal because of its patriarchal origins it instead must be dismissed and re-established to become equitable between the sexes.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pateman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=339\u2013341}}</ref> Women can never truly become individuals because their bodies cannot be forgotten by their male counterparts, a contract between men and women is influenced because of the ideal of embodied feminine beings which can never truly exist as individuals like men can with civil society.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patman|first=Carole|title=The Sexual Contract|publisher=Polity Press|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=340}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''The Sexual Contract'' received the 2005 Benjamin E.

The construction workers have not been paid for months. One night, the workers decide to leave the country by sea, in search of a brighter future in Spain. Among them is Souleiman, the lover of Ada. However, Ada is betrothed to another man \u2013 the wealthy Omar. Ada is deeply worried about Souleiman, as she waits for news of his fate in the run-up to her wedding. On her wedding day, Omar's bed mysteriously catches fire in a suspected arson attack, and a young detective is assigned to investigate the case.\n\nIn the coming days, Ada falls under suspicion and is subjected to interrogations and a virginity test. Meanwhile, her friend Fanta, as well as the young detective are suffering from a mysterious illness. It slowly emerges that the spirits of the men lost at sea have returned and each night take possession of the bodies of other inhabitants of Dakar. Most have their focus on the tycoon who withheld their pay, forcing them to go across the sea. They demand their pay, threatening to burn the tower down otherwise. When they receive their pay from the tycoon they force him to dig their graves so that their spirits may rest. But Souleiman wants only to be with Ada. Unfortunately, he has possessed the young detective, which initially scares Ada. But as she meets the other spirits, including one who possesses Fanta, she comes to understand and spends a last night with the new Souleiman.

Atlantique may not be perfect, but I admired the way that Diop did not simply submit to the realist mode expected from this kind of material, and yet neither did she go into a cliched magic-realist mode, nor make the romantic story the film\u2019s obvious centre.

be officially opened. The construction workers have not been paid for months. One night, the workers decide to leave the country by sea, in search of a brighter future in Spain. Among them is Souleiman, the lover of Ada. However, Ada is betrothed to another man \u2013 the wealthy Omar. Ada is deeply worried about Souleiman, as she waits for news of his fate in the run-up to her wedding. On her wedding day, Omar's bed mysteriously catches fire in a suspected arson attack, and a young detective is assigned to investigate the case.\n\nIn the coming days, Ada falls under suspicion and is subjected to interrogations and a virginity test. Meanwhile, her friend Fanta, as well as the young detective are suffering from a mysterious illness. It slowly emerges that the spirits of the men lost at sea have returned and each night take possession of the bodies of other inhabitants of Dakar. Most have their focus on the tycoon who withheld their pay, forcing them to go across the sea. They demand their pay, threatening to burn the tower down otherwise. When they receive their pay from the tycoon they force him to dig their graves so that their spirits may rest. But Souleiman wants only to be with Ada. Unfortunately, he has possessed the young detective, which initially scares Ada. But as she meets the other spirits, including one who possesses Fanta, she comes to understand and spends a last night with the new Souleiman. While reviewing footage from the wedding, the detective sees that he, under the possession of Souleiman's spirit, was the one who committed the arson.

While the foundation has discouraged (and occasionally taken legal action against) individuals and organizations that have used the Nobel name to refer to prizes not meeting the aforementioned criteria,<ref name=\"nobel foundation\"/> several prominent individuals and organizations have nonetheless used the label \"Nobel Prize of X\" to refer to highly prestigious awards in fields of activity not recognized by the \"real\" Nobel Prizes.

The first was the single \"[[I've Been Loving You]]\" (1968), produced by [[Caleb Quaye]], Bluesology's former guitarist. In 1969, with Quaye, drummer Roger Pope, and bassist Tony Murray, John recorded another single, \"[[Lady Samantha]]\", and an album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''. For their follow-up album, ''[[Elton John (album)|Elton John]]'', John and Taupin enlisted [[Gus Dudgeon]] as producer and [[Paul Buckmaster]] as musical arranger. ''Elton John'' was released in April 1970 on DJM Records/[[Pye Records]] in the UK and [[Uni Records]] in the US, and established the formula for subsequent albums: gospel-chorded rockers and poignant ballads. The album's first single, \"[[Border Song]]\", peaked at 92 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second, \"[[Your Song]]\", reached number seven in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number eight in the US, becoming John's first hit single as a singer.<ref name=\"Charts\">[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John \"Elton John: UK Chart History\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214060116/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/Elton%20John |date=14 February 2015 }}.

These animals were main source of their livelihood of highly priced Balut \n(duck eggs). In [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], the [[List of loanwords in Tagalog#Spanish|Spanish loanword]] for duck is ''pato''; and those who raise ducks are called ''pateros''. At that time, [[domestic duck]]s (whose eggs  produced [[balut (food)|''balut'']]) were abundant in the river that passed through Pateros.\n\nOne evening, under a full moon, a ''bayani'' (local hero) was on his way to the river to slay the creature. At the banks he saw a brilliant light surrounding the figure of Saint Martha;  the creature was never seen again and the local duck industry flourished. The people of Pateros attributed this miracle to Saint Martha and a grand fluvial procession has been held in remembrance of the miracle.\n\n==Feast==\n[[File:MartaRelic.jpg|thumbnail|left|Bone relic of Saint Martha]]\nFormerly, the local feast in honor of Santa Marta de Pateros was variously celebrated in either January, February, or March. The devotees selected a day within these months based on the abundance of the ''balut'' and rice harvested, and whether the date coincided with the full moon needed to illuminate the nighttime ''Pagoda sa Ilog'' (fluvial procession) as there was no electricity. \n\nIn the 1960s, the date was fixed to second Sunday of February to standardise the fiesta following economic and environmental changes to the town. It is also said that during this period, the parish priest Monsignor Sicat moved the celebration to July 29, Saint Martha\u2019s liturgical feast in the Catholic Church.\n\n===''Pamisa de Gracia''===\nThe ''Pamisa de Gracia'' (Tagalog-Spanish for \u201cMass of Grace\u201d) is a ritual and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] that opens every town fiesta. The ''Pamisa'' is done to give thanks for a miracle, birthday, or anniversary obtained or sustained through Saint Martha\u2019s intercession. The family who will organize one borrows the icons of Saints Martha, [[Roch]] and [[Isidore the Labourer]] from the houses of their respective ''camareros'' and ''camareras'' (literally \u201cchamberlains\u201d, the term is used for the official caretaker of a ''[[Santo (art)#Philippines|Santo]]''). \n\nA ''sunduan'' (\u201cfetching\u201d) procession for the images begins on a Friday at the house of the caretaker of St Isidore. A brass band accompanies the image and procession, which proceeds to collect the image of St Roch from its caretaker\u2019s house, before fetching St Martha\u2019s icon. The day after, Saturday, has the host family conducting a prayer vigil at their house. On Sunday, the host family removes the three icons from their house, and in a second procession brings them to the Parish of Saint Roch, for the actual thanksgiving Mass. A third procession after the Mass takes the images back to the house of host family, who then return each icon to the house of its respective caretaker.\n\nThe ''Pamisa'' is also held anytime a family borrows the icons.\n\n==Shrine==\nIn 2008, Rev. Fr. Orly Cantillon, the parish priest of the Church of San Roque in Pateros, filed a petition to [[Francisco San Diego|Bishop Francisco C. San Diego D.D.]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig|Bishop of Pasig]], requesting that the Parish be titled the Diocesan Shrine of Saint Martha. The request was granted and the decree was presented December 2008. The proclamation was made official February 7, 2009, followed by the annual fiesta the next day.\n\nA common error with the Filipinos that Saint Martha is the patron saint of Pateros and not Roch. This belief is supported by the fact that the Natives celebrate the event with Fiesta accompanied by merriments. While on the actual feast of Saint Roch 16 August, the moonsoon is active and often the procession cancelled. Only in the Sixties, that the Parish Priests tried to correct the problem by moving the celebration from 16 August  to the nearest Sunday of the same month. Until today, the town Fiesta is simple, devoid of activities and culinary delicacies.\n\n==Sources==\n\n* [http://stamartaysanroque.blogspot.com/ Diocesan Shrine of St. Martha, Parish of St. Roch Website (Filipino)]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/StaMartaYSanRoque Diocesan Shrine of St. Martha, Parish of St. Roch Facebook page (Filipino)]\n* [http://www.facebook.com/PoderesDeStaMarta Poderes de Santa Marta de Pateros Facebook page (Filipino)]\n*  Nocheseda, Elmer I.
