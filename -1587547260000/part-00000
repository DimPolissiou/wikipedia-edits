It met in [[Washington, DC]] from January 3, 1977, to January 3, 1979, during the final weeks of the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|administration]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]] and the first two years of the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|administration]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Jimmy Carter]].\n\nThe apportionment of seats in this [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[United States Census, 1970|Nineteenth Census of the United States in 1970]]. Both chambers had a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] majority.

Following graduation from the [[University of Tennessee]], he served in the [[United States Navy]] from 1968 to 1972. He was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] as a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]] in 1976, replacing Larry Bates, who mounted an unsuccessful [[primary election|primary]] challenge against U.S. Congressman [[Ed Jones (Tennessee politician)|Ed Jones]].\n\n==U.S. House of Representatives==\n\n===Elections===\nWhen Jones retired in 1988, Tanner won the Democratic nomination for the seat and handily defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] nominee [[Ed Bryant]], who went on to represent the neighboring 7th District from 1995 to 2003. Tanner was reelected in 1990 with no major-party opposition, a feat he repeated in 1992. In 1998, he was completely unopposed. He handily defeated Republican opponents in 1994 (the only time besides his initial election that he faced a serious or well-funded challenger), 1996, 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006.

On both occasions, Hart was disavowed by the state Republican Party.\n\nTanner announced on December 1, 2009 that he would not seek re-election in 2010 and would retire after 11 terms in Congress.

Indeed, no Democrat running in the district has cracked the 40 percent mark since Tanner left office.\n\n===Tenure===\nAs a Congressman, Tanner has sponsored a bill to repeal the [[inheritance tax]] (which was [[veto]]ed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]]) and he is in favor of a balanced budget. It is reported that Tanner could have been appointed to the [[United States Senate]] by [[governor of Tennessee]] [[Ned McWherter]] in 1992 to replace [[Al Gore]] but he declined the offer, and [[Harlan Mathews]] was appointed as a [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] instead. Tanner was a founder of the [[Blue Dog Democrats]] and has denied rumors that he might switch parties, and has an earned reputation as a [[moderate]]. Tanner gained notoriety during the [[Clinton\u2013Lewinsky scandal]] when it was revealed in the [[Starr Report]] that [[President Clinton]] was receiving [[fellatio]] from [[Monica Lewinsky]] while on the phone with Tanner on November 15, 1995 between 9:31pm and 9:35pm. <ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/icreport/srprintable.htm</ref>\n\nTanner is strongly in favor of balancing the budget and paying down the national debt. He has been a strong opponent of the fiscal policies of President [[George W. Bush]], voting against many of the tax cuts passed during his terms; yet, he was one of 43 Democrats to vote to repeal the estate tax in 2006. Tanner was one of the few Democrats in the House to vote in favor of CAFTA and has long distanced himself from the majority of his party on issues such as bankruptcy law and lawsuit reform. He voted for the Federal Marriage Amendment, the ban on \"partial-birth\" abortions, limiting death penalty appeals, and has voted against most gun control measures. On other issues he is more liberal: he often votes with his party on separation of church and states issues, and has consistently voted against the Flag Desecration Amendment. Tanner voted with the majority of his party to expand [[stem cell research]] and against renewing the controversial portions of the [[Patriot Act]]. He also supports [[affirmative action]] and [[public education]]. Tanner was firmly opposed to Bush's attempt to reform [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]].\n\nTanner received much of his knowledge of politics as a youth from his father E.B. \"Buzz\" Tanner who was successful in the financial and insurance business. He became a member of a highly political and influential law firm out of law school in his home town community and soon ran for office as a state legislator in the House of Representatives. He was also a relative of then House Speaker Ned McWherter, who later was elected governor twice and was an extremely powerful political force in the state, having friends on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIn 2004, Congressman Tanner made a brief but unintended cameo appearance alongside [[Michael Moore]] in ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', where Moore was trying to get Congressmen to have their children enlist in the Military to go to Iraq.\n\nHe recently drafted a bill that would require special bipartisan commissions rather than state legislatures to redraw congressional districts when necessary due to U.S. Census count changes.

After undergoing a brief training, from 27 August through 3 September 1937, she carried a special mission in connection with the operations of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. In 1938 she was reassigned to [[La Spezia]] and in 1940, in view of her limited usage, was moved to [[Massawa]] and became part of the 82nd Squadron (VIII Submarine Group) of the [[Red Sea Flotilla]]. On June 10, 1940, in the afternoon, she left Massawa under command of captain Dante Morone to begin her first war mission to operate in an area about eight miles east of [[Port Sudan]].\n\nIt was cloudy and foggy, and this made it virtually impossible for the submarine to use [[Celestial navigation]]. It was also difficult to identify the reference points along the shoreline, and that presented a bigger danger since the area ''Macall\u00e9'' had to cross was littered with islets, sandbanks, reefs and rock outcrops. Also, on June 12 the air conditioning system developed a leak of [[chloromethane]], but the problem was not immediately recognized. After checking the system and not finding any obvious leaks, it was thought that the symptoms were caused by food poisoning. As corrective measures were not taken, on June 14, 1940, all officers and almost all crew developed symptoms of chloromethane poisoning, including some cases of hallucinations.\n\nOn June 14, at dawn, a lighthouse was spotted and thought to be Sanganeb Reef Lighthouse, but it was actually Hindi Gider Lighthouse, located about thirty miles further. This misidentification led the crew to believe the submarine was in deeper waters, while ''Macall\u00e9'' was still moving through a dangerous area. At 02:35 on June 15, ''Macall\u00e9'' ran aground on the island of Bar Musa Chebir, southeast of [[Port Sudan]]. The submarine ended up leaning about 60\u00b0 on the left, with her bow completely out of the water and the stern still submerged. The crew managed to move necessary materials and food onshore and destroy all codes and secret documents. The submarine remained on the rocks for a few hours but then slipped stern first into the water and sank. However, in the confusion and probably still being poisoned by chloromethane the crew failed to inform Massawa about their fate and position. As a result, the submarine crew found itself on an isolated island with scarce supplies and without the base knowing their position, and the fact that ''Macall\u00e9'' sank.\n\nSince it would be impossible to survive for a long time on a deserted island, and not willing to surrender to the British, it was decided to send out a volunteer party to try to reach an Italian outpost on the coast of Eritrea. In the evening of June 15, three men, Elio Sandroni, Torchia and Costagliola Paolo left on a small sailboat. On June 17 they arrived on the coast of [[Sudan]], but since it was British territory, they had to continue. On June 20, 1940 they finally reached the lighthouse of Taclai, in Eritrea, and alerted Massawa's command.\n\nAn airplane ([[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81|SM-81]]) was sent from Massawa and dropped off some food on the island at around 8:00 on June 22, 1940. At the same time submarine ''Guglielmotti'' was sent from the base, and on June 22, 1940 around noon ''Guglielmotti'' rescued the crew of ''Macall\u00e9''. A British seaplane  landed near the island shortly after, but ''Guglielmotti'' was already submerged and on her way back to Massawa.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the crew members, Carlo Acefalo, who was severely poisoned, died on the island on June 17 and was buried there. Elio Sandroni received [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]].\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Bagnasco |first=Erminio |title=Submarines of World War Two |year=1977 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |isbn=0-87021-962-6}} \n*{{cite book|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|editor1-last=Chesneau|editor1-first=Roger|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=Greenwich, UK|year=1980|isbn=0-85177-146-7}}\n*{{cite book|last=Rovighi|first=Alberto|title=Le operazioni in Africa orientale: (giugno 1940-novembre 1941)|publisher=Stato maggiore dell'esercito|year=1988}}\n*{{cite book|last=Giorgerini|first=Giorgio|title=Uomini sul fondo.

In February 1993, [[Wellesley College]] European classics professor [[Mary Lefkowitz]] publicly confronted Ben-Jochannan about his teachings.  Ben-Jochannan taught that [[Aristotle]] visited the [[Library of Alexandria]].  During the question and answer session following the lecture, Lefkowitz asked ben-Jochannan, \"How would that have been possible, when the library was not built until after his death?\" Ben-Jochannan replied that the dates were uncertain.<ref>[http://www.skepdic.com/refuge/lefko.html Not Out of Africa  How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History]</ref> Lefkowitz writes that ben-Jochannan proceeded to tell those present that \"they could and should believe what only Black instructors told them\" and \"that although they might think that Jews were all 'hook-nosed and sallow faced,' there were other Jews who looked like Black like himself.\"<ref>''History Lesson'', pp. 67\u201369.</ref>\n\nAfrican-American professor Clarence E. Walker wrote that Ben-Jochannan not only confused [[Cleopatra VII]] with her daughter [[Cleopatra VIII]] and stated she was black, but also wrote that \"Cleopatra VIII committed suicide after being discovered in a plot with Marc Antonio [Mark Anthony] to murder Julius Caesar.\" This would be highly problematic considering Julius Caesar was assassinated 14 years before [[Cleopatra VII]]'s suicide.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=Clarence E|title=We Can't Go Home Again: An Argument About Afrocentrism|date=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509571-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/wecantgohomeagai0000walk/page/55 55]|url=https://archive.org/details/wecantgohomeagai0000walk|url-access=registration|quote=Yosef Ben-Jochannan cleopatra.}}</ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n* ''African Origins of Major Western Religions'', 1991. {{ISBN|978-0-933121-29-4}}\n* ''We the Black Jews'', 1993, {{ISBN|978-0-933121-40-9}}\n* ''Black Man of the Nile and His Family'', Black Classic Press, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0-933121-26-3}}\n* ''Africa: Mother of Western Civilization''. {{ISBN|978-0-933121-25-6}}\n* ''New Dimensions in African History'' {{ISBN|978-0-86543-226-0}}\n* ''The Myth of Exodus and Genesis and the Exclusion of Their African Origins'' {{ISBN|978-0-933121-76-8}}\n* ''Abu Simbel to Ghizeh: A Guide Book and Manual'', 1989 {{ISBN|978-0-933121-27-0}}\n* ''Cultural Genocide in the Black and African Studies Curriculum''.

He also served three terms in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], from 1967 to 1973.  Though he initiated a number of government reforms and was instrumental in bringing foreign investment to Tennessee, his term as governor was marred by scandal, namely over the selling of pardons and liquor licenses.<ref name=tehc />\n\n==Early life and Congress==\nBlanton was born near [[Adamsville, Tennessee]], the son of Leonard and Ova (Delaney) Blanton.<ref name=tehc /> He was raised in an impoverished [[sharecropping]] family with road-building interests.<ref name=rose />  While working with his family's road company, he occasionally got into fights at bars in [[Mississippi]], and was once grazed in the neck by a stray bullet.<ref name=rose />  Blanton graduated from Shiloh High School in 1948, and obtained a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000548|title=BLANTON, Leonard Ray - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref>  He taught school in [[Mooresville, Indiana]], from 1951 to 1953, when he returned to Adamsville to work in the family construction business, B&B Construction.<ref name=tsla />\n\nIn 1964, Blanton was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]], representing [[McNairy County, Tennessee|McNairy County]].<ref name=tsla />  He often sat in the back of the House chamber wearing sunglasses during House proceedings.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1966, Blanton ran for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]], challenging 12-term incumbent and former [[E. H. Crump|Crump machine]] ally [[Thomas Jefferson Murray|Tom J. Murray]] in the Democratic primary for the [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]], which was based in [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] and included Adamsville.  In a major upset, Blanton edged Murray for the nomination, winning by just 384 votes out of the nearly 70,000 votes cast.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=418862 Our Campaigns - TN District 7, Democratic primary].  ''Our Campaigns''.  Retrieved: 1 January 2013.</ref>   He went on to win the general election, and was twice reelected.\n\nAs a congressman, Blanton had relatively poor attendance, sponsored few bills of significance, and served on just two committees: the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee]], and the District of Columbia committee. He instead focused on his constituents, namely by trying to acquire funding for projects in Tennessee, including the state's first [[Head Start Program]].<ref name=tsla2 />  He spent a great deal of time at his district office responding to voter concerns, and frequently spoke to groups of students.<ref name=tsla2>[http://www.tn.gov/tsla/history/manuscripts/findingaids/95-098.pdf Finding Aid for Ray Blanton Congressional Papers], Tennessee State Library and Archives, 2003.

The merged district retained Blanton's district number, but was geographically more Jones' district.  Rather than run against Jones in 1972, Blanton decided to run for the [[U.S. Senate]].  He easily won the Democratic primary, and faced the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent, [[Howard Baker]], in the [[1972 United States Senate election in Tennessee|general election]]. Unlike Blanton, Baker had supported the Voting Rights Act and the lowering of the voting age, helping him make inroads among two key constituencies, black voters and young voters.<ref name=langsdon />  Baker also tied Blanton to the more liberal Democratic presidential candidate, [[George McGovern]].  On election day, Baker won in a landslide, 716,534 votes to 440,599.<ref name=langsdon />\n\n==Governor==\n\n[[1974 Tennessee gubernatorial election|In 1974]], Blanton won a twelve-person Democratic primary for governor. With just 23% of the vote,<ref name=tehc /> he defeated several well-financed opponents, including flamboyant [[East Tennessee]] banker [[Jake Butcher]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] news anchor Hudley Crockett, and former Senator [[Ross Bass]].<ref name=langsdon />  His opponent in the general election was [[Lamar Alexander]], who had been a campaign manager for the incumbent, [[Winfield Dunn]] (the state constitution at the time prevented governors from serving two consecutive terms, so Dunn could not run).  Though Dunn and Republicans had broken the Democrats' dominance of state politics in 1970, the Republican Party was tarnished by the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=langsdon />  On election day, Blanton defeated Alexander, 576,833 votes to 455,467.<ref name=langsdon />\n\nFollowing his inauguration, Blanton called for a state income tax, but the state legislature, fearing a revolt from voters, refused to consider it, and instead raised the state sales tax.<ref name=langsdon />  Blanton overhauled the state's [[excise tax in the United States|excise]] and [[franchise tax|franchise]] tax laws, and revised the state's [[Hall income tax]] to provide relief for the state's elderly residents.<ref name=langsdon />  He also elevated the state's Office of Tourism to a cabinet-level department, making Tennessee the first state in the nation to do so,<ref name=tehc /> and upgraded the state's retirement system.<ref name=tehc />\n\nBlanton's administration was noted for extensive recruiting of foreign industrial and trade opportunities.  He made several trips to Africa, the Middle East, Japan, and Europe, in an effort to form economic partnerships with foreign investors.  He was criticized for the costs of these trips, but was instrumental in bringing British, West German, and Japanese investment to the state.<ref name=tehc />  In 1976, he hosted a meeting with several [[United Nations]] representatives in Nashville.<ref name=tsla />\n\nIn February 1978, the state constitution was amended to allow Blanton and future Tennessee governors to succeed themselves.

He accepted a controversial $20,000 pay raise,<ref name=tsla />  and often took friends on trips at state expense.<ref name=rose />  He and his aides charged $21,000 to state accounts for bar tabs, limousine rentals, and personal phone calls, though they eventually paid the money back.<ref name=rose />  Blanton was criticized for setting up a large network of county [[patronage]] officials, stating they were his political advisers.\n\nHis family's company was awarded a paving contract at a state park, even though Blanton had assured the company would not do business with the state during his governorship.<ref name=rose />\n\nIn 1977, the \"surplus car scandal\" erupted when state officials were accused of selling surplus state-owned cars to political allies.  Charles Bell, Commissioner of General Services, resigned, and Sonny McCarter, director of the state's Surplus Property Division, pleaded guilty to two counts of [[embezzlement]]. Transportation Commissioner Eddie Shaw was indicted for his role in the scandal, but was acquitted.<ref name=rose />\n\n===Pardons and liquor licenses scandals===\n\nIn 1977, Blanton fired [[Marie Ragghianti]], chairwoman of the state's [[Tennessee Board of Pardons and Paroles|Board of Pardons and Paroles]], when she refused to release prisoners who, as was later determined, had bribed state officials in exchange for obtaining pardons (Ragghianti later sued and won a $38,000 judgment against the state).<ref name=tehc />  On December 15, 1978, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] raided the [[Tennessee State Capitol|state capitol]], and seized documents from the office of Blanton's legal advisor, T. Edward Sisk.  Sisk and two others were arrested, and Blanton appeared before a federal grand jury on December 23, where he denied any wrongdoing.<ref name=tehc />\n\nOn January 15, 1979, near the end of his term, Blanton issued pardons to 52 state prisoners,<ref>{{cite news|title=Blanton Demands Convict's Release|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1941773/blanton_demands_convicts_release/|work=Indiana Evening Gazette|date=23 Jan 1979|page=10}}</ref> including 20 convicted murderers.<ref name=tsla />  Among those pardoned was Roger Humphreys, the son of a Blanton supporter, who had been convicted of killing his ex-wife and a male companion in 1973.<ref name=tehc />  As Blanton signed Humphreys' pardon, he stated, \"this takes guts.\"  The [[Tennessee Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Gentry Crowell]], who was disgusted with the pardons, replied, \"some people have more guts than brains.\"<ref name=rose>Bill Rose, \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19790123&id=qcEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3VgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6562,1750111 The 'Hillbilly Nixon'],\" ''St. Petersburg Evening Independent'', 23 January 1979.

They found it in the state constitution, which is somewhat vague on when a newly elected governor must be sworn in.  It was eventually decided to swear in Lamar Alexander, who had won the 1978 gubernatorial election, three days before the traditional inauguration day.

He also served three terms in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], from 1967 to 1973.  Though he initiated a number of government reforms and was instrumental in bringing foreign investment to Tennessee, his term as governor was marred by scandal, namely over the selling of pardons and liquor licenses.<ref name=tehc />\n\n==Early life and Congress==\nBlanton was born near [[Adamsville, Tennessee]], the son of Leonard and Ova (Delaney) Blanton.<ref name=tehc /> He was raised in an impoverished [[sharecropping]] family with road-building interests.<ref name=rose />  While working with his family's road company, he occasionally got into fights at bars in [[Mississippi]], and was once grazed in the neck by a stray bullet.<ref name=rose />  Blanton graduated from Shiloh High School in 1948, and obtained a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000548|title=BLANTON, Leonard Ray - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref>  He taught school in [[Mooresville, Indiana]], from 1951 to 1953, when he returned to Adamsville to work in the family construction business, B&B Construction.<ref name=tsla />\n\nIn 1964, Blanton was elected to the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]], representing [[McNairy County, Tennessee|McNairy County]].<ref name=tsla />  He often sat in the back of the House chamber wearing sunglasses during House proceedings.<ref name=tehc />\n\nIn 1966, Blanton ran for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]], challenging 12-term incumbent and former [[E. H. Crump|Crump machine]] ally [[Thomas Jefferson Murray|Tom J. Murray]] in the Democratic primary for the [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district|7th congressional district]], which was based in [[Jackson, Tennessee|Jackson]] and included Adamsville.  In a major upset, Blanton edged Murray for the nomination, winning by just 384 votes out of the nearly 70,000 votes cast.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=418862 Our Campaigns - TN District 7, Democratic primary].  ''Our Campaigns''.  Retrieved: 1 January 2013.</ref>   He went on to win the general election, and was twice reelected.\n\nAs a congressman, Blanton had relatively poor attendance, sponsored few bills of significance, and served on just two committees: the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee]], and the District of Columbia committee. He instead focused on his constituents, namely by trying to acquire funding for projects in Tennessee, including the state's first [[Head Start Program]].<ref name=tsla2 />  He spent a great deal of time at his district office responding to voter concerns, and frequently spoke to groups of students.<ref name=tsla2>[http://www.tn.gov/tsla/history/manuscripts/findingaids/95-098.pdf Finding Aid for Ray Blanton Congressional Papers], Tennessee State Library and Archives, 2003.

The merged district retained Blanton's district number, but was geographically more Jones' district.  Rather than run against Jones in 1972, Blanton decided to run for the [[U.S. Senate]].  He easily won the Democratic primary, and faced the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent, [[Howard Baker]], in the [[1972 United States Senate election in Tennessee|general election]]. Unlike Blanton, Baker had supported the Voting Rights Act and the lowering of the voting age, helping him make inroads among two key constituencies, black voters and young voters.<ref name=langsdon />  Baker also tied Blanton to the more liberal Democratic presidential candidate, [[George McGovern]].  On election day, Baker won in a landslide, 716,534 votes to 440,599.<ref name=langsdon />\n\n==Governor==\n\n[[1974 Tennessee gubernatorial election|In 1974]], Blanton won a twelve-person Democratic primary for governor. With just 23% of the vote,<ref name=tehc /> he defeated several well-financed opponents, including flamboyant [[East Tennessee]] banker [[Jake Butcher]], [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] news anchor Hudley Crockett, and former Senator [[Ross Bass]].<ref name=langsdon />  His opponent in the general election was [[Lamar Alexander]], who had been a campaign manager for the incumbent, [[Winfield Dunn]] (the state constitution at the time prevented governors from serving two consecutive terms, so Dunn could not run).  Though Dunn and Republicans had broken the Democrats' dominance of state politics in 1970, the Republican Party was tarnished by the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=langsdon />  On election day, Blanton defeated Alexander, 576,833 votes to 455,467.<ref name=langsdon />\n\nFollowing his inauguration, Blanton called for a state income tax, but the state legislature, fearing a revolt from voters, refused to consider it, and instead raised the state sales tax.<ref name=langsdon />  Blanton overhauled the state's [[excise tax in the United States|excise]] and [[franchise tax|franchise]] tax laws, and revised the state's [[Hall income tax]] to provide relief for the state's elderly residents.<ref name=langsdon />  He also elevated the state's Office of Tourism to a cabinet-level department, making Tennessee the first state in the nation to do so,<ref name=tehc /> and upgraded the state's retirement system.<ref name=tehc />\n\nBlanton's administration was noted for extensive recruiting of foreign industrial and trade opportunities.  He made several trips to Africa, the Middle East, Japan, and Europe, in an effort to form economic partnerships with foreign investors.  He was criticized for the costs of these trips, but was instrumental in bringing British, West German, and Japanese investment to the state.<ref name=tehc />  In 1976, he hosted a meeting with several [[United Nations]] representatives in Nashville.<ref name=tsla />\n\nIn February 1978, the state constitution was amended to allow Blanton and future Tennessee governors to succeed themselves.

He accepted a controversial $20,000 pay raise,<ref name=tsla />  and often took friends on trips at state expense.<ref name=rose />  He and his aides charged $21,000 to state accounts for bar tabs, limousine rentals, and personal phone calls, though they eventually paid the money back.<ref name=rose />  Blanton was criticized for setting up a large network of county [[patronage]] officials, stating they were his political advisers.\n\nHis family's company was awarded a paving contract at a state park, even though Blanton had assured the company would not do business with the state during his governorship.<ref name=rose />\n\nIn 1977, the \"surplus car scandal\" erupted when state officials were accused of selling surplus state-owned cars to political allies.  Charles Bell, Commissioner of General Services, resigned, and Sonny McCarter, director of the state's Surplus Property Division, pleaded guilty to two counts of [[embezzlement]]. Transportation Commissioner Eddie Shaw was indicted for his role in the scandal, but was acquitted.<ref name=rose />\n\n===Pardons and liquor licenses scandals===\n\nIn 1977, Blanton fired [[Marie Ragghianti]], chairwoman of the state's [[Tennessee Board of Pardons and Paroles|Board of Pardons and Paroles]], when she refused to release prisoners who, as was later determined, had bribed state officials in exchange for obtaining pardons (Ragghianti later sued and won a $38,000 judgment against the state).<ref name=tehc />  On December 15, 1978, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigations|FBI]] raided the [[Tennessee State Capitol|state capitol]], and seized documents from the office of Blanton's legal advisor, T.

Sisk and two others were arrested, and Blanton appeared before a federal grand jury on December 23, where he denied any wrongdoing.<ref name=tehc />\n\nOn January 15, 1979, near the end of his term, Blanton issued pardons to 52 state prisoners,<ref>{{cite news|title=Blanton Demands Convict's Release|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1941773/blanton_demands_convicts_release/|work=Indiana Evening Gazette|date=23 Jan 1979|page=10}}</ref> including 20 convicted murderers.<ref name=tsla />  Among those pardoned was Roger Humphreys, the son of a Blanton supporter, who had been convicted of killing his ex-wife and a male companion in 1973.<ref name=tehc />  As Blanton signed Humphreys' pardon, he stated, \"this takes guts.\"  The [[Tennessee Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Gentry Crowell]], who was disgusted with the pardons, replied, \"some people have more guts than brains.\"<ref name=rose>Bill Rose, \"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19790123&id=qcEwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3VgDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6562,1750111 The 'Hillbilly Nixon'],\" ''St. Petersburg Evening Independent'', 23 January 1979.
