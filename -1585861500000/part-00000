It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]''. The song peaked at number 11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, number 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] as well as top-ten on many other European charts. \"Nothing Else Matters\" was featured as a playable track in the music video game ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]''. Recognized as one of Metallica's best known and most popular songs, it has become a staple in live performances. \n\n==History==\nLead singer and rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] wrote the song (credited to Hetfield/Ulrich<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |title=Metallica - Metallica |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/metallica-mw0000311315 |website=Allmusic.com |access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref>) in 1990 while he was on the phone with his then girlfriend. Since he held the phone with one hand, he plucked the four open strings of a standard E-minor chord with the other, which eventually made up the first two bars of the song. The lyrics, which talk about being \"so close, no matter how far\", were also dedicated to his girlfriend, indicating the bond they shared even when Hetfield was on tour. Initially, the song was not meant to be released, as Hetfield had written it for himself, but after drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] heard it, it was considered for the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/06/metallica_black_album_interview.php |title=James Hetfield And Kirk Hammett Look Back On Metallica's Black Album |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Demo==\nThe song's demo was also called \"Nothing Else Matters\" and was recorded in Lars Ulrich's home musical studio \"Dungeon\" on August 13, 1990.\n\n==Composition==\nIts intro is an E minor [[arpeggio]] (transposed one half-step lower on stage performances) beginning with the open low E followed by the open G, B and high E strings.\n\nIt is one of the few Metallica songs in which Hetfield plays the guitar solo. Given that Hetfield recorded all rhythm and most harmony tracks on the band's first five albums and that Hammett has stated he didn't learn how to play the song until they were well into the tour for the album, Hammett does not play on the studio recording, making it one of the few in the whole Metallica repertoire, along with [[Cliff Burton]]'s \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", in which he does not appear.\n\nThe orchestral arrangements were written by award-winning composer [[Michael Kamen]], who would later go on to collaborate with the group on [[S&M (album)|''S&M'']].\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video premiered on [[MTV]] on February 26, 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It was directed by [[Adam Dubin]], and edited by Sean Fullan.  The clip consists of parts of the ''[[A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica|A year and a half...]]'' video tape which was shot during the recordings of ''Metallica''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} One of them shows Hetfield playing a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] guitar during the second chorus. MTV will not air the video during daytime hours anymore because it features nudity in the form of pin-up posters and [[Playboy]] centerfolds that are taped up in the studio. It also has a picture of [[Winger (band)|Winger]]'s [[Kip Winger]] which Lars Ulrich is seen throwing darts at. On the band's 2006 music video compilation DVD, the posters are censored, as was done with the nudity featured in the music videos for \"[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)#Covers|Turn the Page]]\" and \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\".\n\n==Live==\nThe song has now become a staple in Metallica's live performances, and has been dedicated to their fans. When played live nowadays, Hammett does the first part of the intro, and Hetfield joins in for the second, to then sing and play it alone until after the first chorus, when the whole band kicks in. Also, the last verse is left out, ending the song with the heavily distorted guitar solo by Hetfield, and usually fading into \"[[Enter Sandman]]\". A live version on which this can be heard, can be found on the CD/DVD ''[[Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico]]''. Other live recordings can be found on ''[[Live Shit: Binge & Purge]]'', on ''[[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]]'', Cunning Stunts DVD as well as the [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''[[The Big 4 Live from Sofia, Bulgaria]]'' as well as on the soundtrack for the band's [[Metallica Through the Never|feature film \"Through the Never\"]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n|headline = U.S. cassette\n|title1

It was released in 1992 as the third single from their self-titled fifth studio album, ''[[Metallica (album)|Metallica]]''. The song peaked at number 11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart, number 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] as well as top-ten on many other European charts. \"Nothing Else Matters\" was featured as a playable track in the music video game ''[[Guitar Hero: Metallica]]''. Recognized as one of Metallica's best known and most popular songs, it has become a staple in live performances. \n\n==History==\nLead singer and rhythm guitarist [[James Hetfield]] wrote the song (credited to Hetfield/Ulrich<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web |title=Metallica - Metallica |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/metallica-mw0000311315 |website=Allmusic.com |access-date=16 July 2018}}</ref>) in 1990 while he was on the phone with his then girlfriend. Since he held the phone with one hand, he plucked the four open strings of a standard E-minor chord with the other, which eventually made up the first two bars of the song. The lyrics, which talk about being \"so close, no matter how far\", were also dedicated to his girlfriend, indicating the bond they shared even when Hetfield was on tour. Initially, the song was not meant to be released, as Hetfield had written it for himself, but after drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] heard it, it was considered for the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/06/metallica_black_album_interview.php |title=James Hetfield And Kirk Hammett Look Back On Metallica's Black Album |date=2012-06-22 |accessdate=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\n==Demo==\nThe song's demo was also called \"Nothing Else Matters\" and was recorded in Lars Ulrich's home musical studio \"Dungeon\" on August 13, 1990.\n\n==Composition==\nIts intro is an E minor [[arpeggio]] (transposed one half-step lower on stage performances) beginning with the open low E followed by the open G, B and high E strings.\n\nIt is one of the few Metallica songs in which Hetfield plays the guitar solo. Given that Hetfield recorded all rhythm and most harmony tracks on the band's first five albums and that Hammett has stated he didn't learn how to play the song until they were well into the tour for the album, Hammett does not play on the studio recording, making it one of the few in the whole Metallica repertoire, along with [[Cliff Burton]]'s \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", in which he does not appear.\n\nThe orchestral arrangements were written by award-winning composer [[Michael Kamen]], who would later go on to collaborate with the group on [[S&M (album)|''S&M'']].\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video premiered on [[MTV]] on February 26, 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} It was directed by [[Adam Dubin]], and edited by Sean Fullan.  The clip consists of parts of the ''[[A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica|A year and a half...]]'' video tape which was shot during the recordings of ''Metallica''.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} One of them shows Hetfield playing a [[Gibson EDS-1275]] guitar during the second chorus. MTV will not air the video during daytime hours anymore because it features nudity in the form of pin-up posters and [[Playboy]] centerfolds that are taped up in the studio. It also has a picture of [[Winger (band)|Winger]]'s [[Kip Winger]] which Lars Ulrich is seen throwing darts at. On the band's 2006 music video compilation DVD, the posters are censored, as was done with the nudity featured in the music videos for \"[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)#Covers|Turn the Page]]\" and \"[[Whiskey in the Jar]]\".\n\n==Live==\nThe song has now become a staple in Metallica's live performances, and has been dedicated to their fans. When played live nowadays, Hammett does the first part of the intro, and Hetfield joins in for the second, to then sing and play it alone until after the first chorus, when the whole band kicks in. Also, the last verse is left out, ending the song with the heavily distorted guitar solo by Hetfield, and usually fading into \"[[Enter Sandman]]\". A live version on which this can be heard, can be found on the CD/DVD ''[[Orgullo, Pasi\u00f3n y Gloria: Tres Noches en la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico]]''. Other live recordings can be found on ''[[Live Shit: Binge & Purge]]'', on ''[[S&M (Metallica album)|S&M]]'', Cunning Stunts DVD as well as the [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray]] ''[[The Big 4 Live from Sofia, Bulgaria]]'' as well as on the soundtrack for the band's [[Metallica Through the Never|feature film \"Through the Never\"]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n|headline = U.S. cassette\n|title1

[[Self-help]] advocate [[Samuel Smiles]] particularly praised his achievements. His chosen [[Track gauge#The Stockton and Darlington Railway|rail gauge]], sometimes called 'Stephenson gauge',{{efn-lr|'Stephenson gauge' was initially of {{convert|4|ft|8|in|mm}} in the North East of England. For the higher speeds of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], this was expanded slightly to {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} between the rails whilst keeping the same spacing between the wheels, making it more free-running. It is unclear how much of this was George Stephenson's initiative and how much was his son Robert's.}} was the basis for the {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} [[standard gauge]] used by most of the world's railways.\n\nPioneered by Stephenson, [[rail transport]] was one of the most important technological inventions of the 19th century and a key component of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Built by George and his son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]]'s company [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], the [[Locomotion No. 1|''Locomotion'' No. 1]] is the first [[steam locomotive]] to carry passengers on a public rail line, the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], which [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened in 1830]].\n\n==Childhood and early life==\nGeorge Stephenson was born on 9 June 1781 in [[Wylam]], [[Northumberland]], which is 9 miles (15&nbsp;km) west of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He was the second child of Robert and Mabel Stephenson,<ref name=\"odnb\">{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=M.

Robert was the fireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there was no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row Pit in [[Newburn]] nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to study at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic \u2013 he was [[illiterate]] until the age of 18. \n\nIn 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of [[Ponteland]] as a 'brakesman', controlling the winding gear at the pit.<ref>http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-Miners-lamp.html</ref> In 1802 he married Frances Henderson and moved to [[Willington Quay]], east of Newcastle. There he worked as a brakesman while they lived in one room of a cottage. George made shoes and mended clocks to supplement his income.\n\n[[File:Longbenton - Dial Cottage, Westmoor.jpg|thumb|Dial Cottage, [[West Moor]], Killingworth]]\nTheir first child [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was born in 1803, and in 1804 they moved to Dial Cottage at [[West Moor]], near [[Killingworth]] where George worked as a brakesman at Killingworth Pit. Their second child, a daughter, was born in July 1805. She was named Frances after her mother. The child died after just three weeks and was buried in [[St Bartholomew's Church, Long Benton]] north of Newcastle.\n\nIn 1806 George's wife Frances died of consumption ([[tuberculosis]]). She was buried in the same churchyard as their daughter on the 16th May 1806, though sadly the location of the grave is lost.<ref >{{cite web |url=https://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c4025218-ae88-43ae-8dec-8d2be92cbe37/attachment.aspx   |title=Robert Stephenson, Engineer 1803\u20131859 |website=Northumbria Trail |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers}}</ref>\n\nGeorge decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman while he went to work in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. After a few months he returned, probably because his father was blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a cottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after Robert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working properly and Stephenson offered to improve it.<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> He did so with such success that he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth, responsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines. He became an expert in steam-driven machinery.<ref name=\"Davies\" >{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Hunter |authorlink=Hunter Davies |year=1975 |title=George Stephenson |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |isbn=0-297-76934-0}}</ref>\n\n==The miner's safety lamp==\n{{Further information|Safety lamp}}\n[[File:Stephenson-safety-lamp.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's safety lamp shown with Davy's lamp on the left]]\nIn 1815, aware of the explosions often caused in mines by naked flames, Stephenson began to experiment with a [[safety lamp]] that would burn in a gaseous atmosphere without causing an explosion. At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman [[Humphry Davy]] was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass. \n\nA month before Davy presented his design to the [[Royal Society]], Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which [[firedamp]] was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded \u00a32,000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy,<ref>http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-Miners-lamp.html</ref> because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.\n\nStephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught to speak in [[Standard English]] with a [[Received Pronunciation]] accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with Parliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his father.\n\nA local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated him, proved he had been working separately to create the '[[Geordie]] Lamp', and awarded him \u00a31,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their findings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could come up with the solution he had. In 1833 a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committee found that Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went to his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson lamp was used almost exclusively in [[North East England]], whereas the Davy lamp was used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust of London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nIn his book ''George and Robert Stephenson'', the author [[L.T.C. Rolt]] relates that opinion varied about the two lamps' efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more light, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous atmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.\n\nThere is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of [[Geordie]]s to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the name of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By 1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=Geordie}}</ref>\n\n==Early locomotives==\nCornishman [[Richard Trevithick]] is credited with the first realistic design for a steam locomotive in 1802. Later, he visited [[Tyneside]] and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were inspired by this, and designed their own engines.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[File:Killingworth-locomotive.jpg|thumb|Early Stephenson locomotive illustrated in [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''Lives of the Engineers'' (1862).<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> <br>Described as an 1816 Killingworth Colliery locomotive, this is often claimed to be ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'', but more closely resembles the slightly later [[Hetton colliery railway]] locomotives, and their 1852 replica ''[[Lyons, Hetton colliery railway|Lyons]]'', which was still operating at Smiles' time. <ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" />]]\nStephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'' after the [[Prussia]]n general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]] (It was suggested the name sprang from Bl\u00fccher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]).{{efn-lr|Recent scholarship holds that Stephenson's ''My Lord'' of 1814 pre-dated ''Bl\u00fccher''<ref name=\"Bailey, Stephenson\" />}} ''Bl\u00fccher'' was modelled on [[Matthew Murray]]\u2019s locomotive ''Willington'', which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at {{convert|4|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction depended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail. \n\nAltogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at Killingworth,<ref name=\"Davies\"/> although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing list of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth or for the [[Hetton colliery railway]]. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]] in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast-iron rails.<ref>Smiles (1857)</ref> Another locomotive was supplied to Scott's Pit railroad at [[Llansamlet]], near [[Swansea]], in 1819 but it too was withdrawn, apparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the track.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Reynolds |chapter=George Stephenson's 1819 Llansamlet locomotive | editor-first=M.J.T. |editor-last=Lewis |title=Early Railways 2: papers from the Second International Early Railways Conference |location=London |publisher=Newcomen Society |date=2003 |pages=165\u201376}}</ref>\n\n[[File:stephenson-rail-patent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fishbelly rail]] with half-lap joint, patented by Stephenson 1816]]\nThe new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron edge rails were in their infancy, with [[cast iron]] exhibiting excessive brittleness. Together with [[William Losh]], Stephenson improved the design of cast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] at their Walker ironworks. \n\nAccording to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a [[steam spring]] (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] Stephenson used [[wrought-iron]] malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nock|first=Oswald|authorlink=O.

He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives for level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power, opened in 1822. This line used a gauge of {{railgauge|4ft8in|lk=on}} which Stephenson had used before at the [[Killingworth]] wagonway.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Robin|title=The Rocket Men|date=2013|publisher=Mortons Media Group|isbn=978-1909128255|page=33}}</ref>\n\nOther locomotives include:\n* 1817\u20131824 ''The Duke'' for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]]\n\n==Stockton and Darlington Railway==\n[[File:Stephenson-No.1-engine.jpg|thumb|The No. 1 engine, called ''Locomotion'', for the Stockton & Darlington Railway]]\nIn 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (S&DR). The {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} railway connected collieries near [[Bishop Auckland]] to the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], passing through [[Darlington]] on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts on metal rails, but after company director [[Edward Pease (1767-1858)|Edward Pease]] met Stephenson, he agreed to change the plans.\nStephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted by his eighteen-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n[[File:Stephenson-Experiment-.jpg|thumb|The Experiment \u2013 the first railway carriage]]\nA manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and Stephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture locomotives. It was set up as [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], and George's son Robert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of [[Bedlington Ironworks]].<ref name=\"Davies\"/> On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson & Co was described as \"Engineers, Millwrights & Machinists, Brass & Iron Founders\".<ref name=EllisandMorse>{{cite book |title=Steaming through Britain |first1=Chris |last1=Ellis |first2=Greg |last2=Morse |publisher=Conway |location=London |year=2010 |page=47 |isbn=978-1-84486-121-7}}</ref> In September 1825 the works at Forth Street, Newcastle completed the first locomotive for the railway: originally named ''Active'', it was renamed ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' and was followed by ''Hope'', ''Diligence'' and ''Black Diamond''. The Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by Stephenson, ''Locomotion'' hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} in two hours, reaching a speed of {{convert|24|mph|km/h|abbr=off}} on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, ''Experiment'', was attached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time passenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe rails used for the line were [[wrought-iron]], produced by [[John Birkinshaw]] at the [[Bedlington Ironworks]]. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer lengths than [[cast-iron]] and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy locomotives. [[William Losh]] of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with Stephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson's decision caused a permanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} which subsequently was adopted as the standard gauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Liverpool and Manchester Railway==\n[[File:George Stephenson - National Railway Museum - 2005-10-15.jpg|thumb|Statue of George Stephenson at the [[National Railway Museum]], [[York]]]]\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|First passenger railway, L&MR]]\nStephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power of the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260.<ref>{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=244}}</ref> He concluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this knowledge while working on the [[Bolton and Leigh Railway]], and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings, embankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of the original route of the L&MR caused by hostility from some affected landowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary scrutiny of the original bill, especially under [[cross-examination]] by [[Edward Alderson (judge)|Edward Hall Alderson]]. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment was submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment presented the problem of crossing [[Chat Moss]], an apparently bottomless peat bog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line across it.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The method he used was similar to that used by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]] who constructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a foundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight of the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.\n\nAs the L&MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a competition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the [[Rainhill Trials]] were run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to travel along the track for a total distance of {{convert|60|mi|km}}. Stephenson's entry was ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', and its performance in winning the contest made it famous. George's son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and returned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in [[Liverpool]] overseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the detailed design of ''Rocket'', although he was in constant postal communication with his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation, suggested by [[Henry Booth]], treasurer of the L&MR, was the use of a [[fire-tube boiler]], invented by French engineer [[Marc Seguin]] that gave improved heat exchange.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening ceremony of the L&MR]], on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool. The parade was led by ''[[Northumbrian (locomotive)|Northumbrian]]'' driven by George Stephenson, and included ''Phoenix'' driven by his son Robert, ''North Star'' driven by his brother Robert and ''Rocket'' driven by assistant engineer [[Joseph Locke]]. The day was marred by the death of [[William Huskisson]], the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck by ''Rocket''. Stephenson evacuated the injured Huskisson to [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the tragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and was offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other railways.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Stephenson's skew arch bridge==\n[[File:Stephensonbridge1.jpg|left|thumb|Stephenson's bridge]]\n[[File:StephensonBridgeClose.jpg|right|thumb|A close-up of the technique]]\n\n1830 also saw the grand opening of the [[skew arch|skew bridge]] in Rainhill over the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any railway at an angle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rainhillparish.org.uk/history/railway_history.html |title=Railway History |website=Rainhill Parish Council }}</ref> It required the structure to be constructed as two flat planes (overlapping in this case by {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}}) between which the stonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the effect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming the arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest). The technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides extra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simmons, Jack  |author2=Biddle, Gordon | title=The Oxford companion to British railway history | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | pages=45\u201347 |isbn=0-19-211697-5}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is still in use at [[Rainhill railway station|Rainhill station]], and carries traffic on the [[A57 road|A57]] (Warrington Road). The bridge is a [[Listed building|listed structure]].\n\n==Life at Alton Grange==\n[[File:George Stephenson's House at Alton Grange.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's House at Alton Grange]]\n\nGeorge Stephenson moved to the parish of [[Alton, Leicestershire|Alton]] Grange (now part of Ravenstone) in Leicestershire in 1830, originally to consult on the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]], a line primarily proposed to take coal from the western coal fields of the county to Leicester. The promoters of the line Mr [[William Stenson]] and [[John Ellis (businessman)|Mr John Ellis]], had difficulties in raising the necessary capital as the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the potential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested \u00a32,500 and raised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening in 1832.\n\nDuring this same period the [[Snibston]] estate in Leicestershire came up for auction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was believed to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial potential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the fact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by canal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.\n\nEmploying a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to access the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater. Stephenson\u2019s coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester dramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some \u00a340,000 per annum.\n\nStephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to [[Tapton House]] in Derbyshire. \n<ref>The Life of George & Robert Stephenson by Samuel Smile 1857</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:George Stephenson - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|thumb|George Stephenson]]\nThe next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson's life as he was besieged with requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad builders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so locomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops. Stephenson's conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he favoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than his successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the [[West Coast Main Line]] taking the direct route favoured by [[Joseph Locke]] over [[Lancaster and Carlisle Railway|Shap]] between [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route via [[Ulverston]] and [[Whitehaven]]. Locke's route was built. \n\nStephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in general. He worked with Joseph Locke on the [[Grand Junction Railway]] with half of the line allocated to each man. Stephenson's estimates and organising ability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board's dissatisfaction led to Stephenson's resignation causing a rift between them which was never healed.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDespite Stephenson's loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he was offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all that was offered. He worked on the [[North Midland Railway|North Midland]] line from [[Derby]] to [[Leeds]], the [[York and North Midland Railway|York and North Midland]] line from Normanton to York, the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway|Manchester and Leeds]], the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway|Birmingham and Derby]], the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway|Sheffield and Rotherham]] among many others.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nStephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical adviser.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He was the first president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled into semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire \u2013 tunnelling for the [[North Midland Railway]] revealed coal seams, and Stephenson put money into their exploitation.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGeorge first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner.<ref>Samuel Smiles disputes this account, saying that Miss Hindmarsh's brother assured him that she didn't meet him before 1818 or 1819. See ''Lives of the Engineers'' 1862 vol 3. p116 (footnote).\n</ref> George next paid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she rejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny), who was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at [[Newburn]] Church on 28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the latter died within months. George's wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the year after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a succession of neighbours and then by George's unmarried sister Eleanor (Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George's return.\n\nOn 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh at Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children and Betty died on 3 August 1845.<Ref>http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Stephenson_G/stephensonGeorge8.asp</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1848, at St John's Church in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, George married for the third time, to Ellen Gregory, another farmer's daughter originally from [[Bakewell]] in Derbyshire, who had been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted [[pleurisy]] and died, aged 67, at noon on 12 August 1848<Ref>Derbyshire Courier - 19 August 1848</ref> at [[Tapton House]] in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at [[Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield]], alongside his second wife.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDescribed by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the wives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident or misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen gardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built hothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a 'not too friendly' rivalry with [[Joseph Paxton]]'s father, head gardener at nearby [[Chatsworth House]], twice beating the master of the craft.\n\n===Descendants===\nGeorge Stephenson had two children. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was born on 16 October 1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London professional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no children. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a major railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the Alexandria\u2013Cairo railway that later connected with the [[Suez Canal]]. George Stephenson's daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth. Descendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam (Stephenson's birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live in Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, with later generations remaining to this day.\n\n==Legacy==\nBritain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus for the [[Industrial Revolution]] by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for the railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant [[Joseph Locke]] who carried out much work on his own account and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being built would eventually be joined together, and would need to have the same gauge. The [[standard gauge]] used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002, Stephenson was named in the [[BBC]]'s television show and list of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons \u2013 A complete list |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Victorian self-help advocate [[Samuel Smiles]] had published his first biography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the favour of George at the expense his rivals as well as his son, it was popular and 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The [[Band of Hope]] were selling biographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a suggestion to move George's body to Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Davies|1975|pp=288\u2013290}}{{sfn|Rolt|1984|p=ix}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rocket Men: George and Robert Stephenson|editor=Jones, Robin|year=2013|publisher=Morton's Media|isbn=978-1-909128-27-9|page=23}}</ref> The centenary of George's birth was celebrated in 1881 at [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] by 15,000 people,{{sfn|Davies|1975|p=295}} and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|five pound note]] issued by the [[Bank of England]] between 1990 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/withdrawn_notes.aspx | title=Notes recently withdrawn from circulation | publisher=Bank of England | accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> The [[Stephenson Railway Museum]] in [[North Shields]] is named after George and Robert Stephenson.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/stephenson/about-us.html | title=Join the railway revolution (about us) | publisher=Stephenson Railway Museum | year=2014 | accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials and commemorations==\n\n[[File:George Stephenson - geograph.org.uk - 2315455.jpg|thumb|right|George Stephenson statue, Chesterfield March 2011]]\n[[George Stephenson's Birthplace]] is an 18th-century [[historic house museum]] in the village of [[Wylam]], and is operated by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

[[Self-help]] advocate [[Samuel Smiles]] particularly praised his achievements. His chosen [[Track gauge#The Stockton and Darlington Railway|rail gauge]], sometimes called 'Stephenson gauge',{{efn-lr|'Stephenson gauge' was initially of {{convert|4|ft|8|in|mm}} in the North East of England. For the higher speeds of the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], this was expanded slightly to {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} between the rails whilst keeping the same spacing between the wheels, making it more free-running.

Built by George and his son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]]'s company [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], the [[Locomotion No. 1|''Locomotion'' No. 1]] is the first [[steam locomotive]] to carry passengers on a public rail line, the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825. George also built the first public inter-city railway line in the world to use locomotives, the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]], which [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opened in 1830]].\n\n==Childhood and early life==\nGeorge Stephenson was born on 9 June 1781 in [[Wylam]], [[Northumberland]], which is 9 miles (15&nbsp;km) west of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. He was the second child of Robert and Mabel Stephenson,<ref name=\"odnb\">{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=M.

Robert was the fireman for Wylam Colliery pumping engine, earning a very low wage, so there was no money for schooling. At 17, Stephenson became an engineman at Water Row Pit in [[Newburn]] nearby. George realised the value of education and paid to study at night school to learn reading, writing and arithmetic \u2013 he was [[illiterate]] until the age of 18. \n\nIn 1801 he began work at Black Callerton Colliery south of [[Ponteland]] as a 'brakesman', controlling the winding gear at the pit.<ref>http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-Miners-lamp.html</ref> In 1802 he married Frances Henderson and moved to [[Willington Quay]], east of Newcastle.

The child died after just three weeks and was buried in [[St Bartholomew's Church, Long Benton]] north of Newcastle.\n\nIn 1806 George's wife Frances died of consumption ([[tuberculosis]]). She was buried in the same churchyard as their daughter on the 16th May 1806, though sadly the location of the grave is lost.<ref >{{cite web |url=https://www.ice.org.uk/getattachment/c4025218-ae88-43ae-8dec-8d2be92cbe37/attachment.aspx   |title=Robert Stephenson, Engineer 1803\u20131859 |website=Northumbria Trail |publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers}}</ref>\n\nGeorge decided to find work in Scotland and left Robert with a local woman while he went to work in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]]. After a few months he returned, probably because his father was blinded in a mining accident. He moved back into a cottage at West Moor and his unmarried sister Eleanor moved in to look after Robert. In 1811 the pumping engine at High Pit, Killingworth was not working properly and Stephenson offered to improve it.<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> He did so with such success that he was promoted to enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth, responsible for maintaining and repairing all the colliery engines.

At the same time, the eminent scientist and Cornishman [[Humphry Davy]] was also looking at the problem. Despite his lack of scientific knowledge, Stephenson, by trial and error, devised a lamp in which the air entered via tiny holes, through which the flames of the lamp could not pass. \n\nA month before Davy presented his design to the [[Royal Society]], Stephenson demonstrated his own lamp to two witnesses by taking it down Killingworth Colliery and holding it in front of a fissure from which [[firedamp]] was issuing. The two designs differed; Davy's lamp was surrounded by a screen of gauze, whereas Stephenson's prototype lamp had a perforated plate contained in a glass cylinder. For his invention Davy was awarded \u00a32,000, whilst Stephenson was accused of stealing the idea from Davy,<ref>http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-Miners-lamp.html</ref> because he was not seen as an adequate scientist who could have produced the lamp by any approved scientific method.\n\nStephenson, having come from the North-East, spoke with a broad Northumberland accent and not the 'Language of Parliament,' which made him seem lowly. Realizing this, he made a point of educating his son Robert in a private school, where he was taught to speak in [[Standard English]] with a [[Received Pronunciation]] accent. It was due to this, in their future dealings with Parliament, that it became clear that the authorities preferred Robert to his father.\n\nA local committee of enquiry gathered in support of Stephenson, exonerated him, proved he had been working separately to create the '[[Geordie]] Lamp', and awarded him \u00a31,000, but Davy and his supporters refused to accept their findings, and would not see how an uneducated man such as Stephenson could come up with the solution he had. In 1833 a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] committee found that Stephenson had equal claim to having invented the safety lamp. Davy went to his grave believing that Stephenson had stolen his idea. The Stephenson lamp was used almost exclusively in [[North East England]], whereas the Davy lamp was used everywhere else. The experience gave Stephenson a lifelong distrust of London-based, theoretical, scientific experts.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nIn his book ''George and Robert Stephenson'', the author [[L.T.C. Rolt]] relates that opinion varied about the two lamps' efficiency: that the Davy Lamp gave more light, but the Geordie Lamp was thought to be safer in a more gaseous atmosphere. He made reference to an incident at Oaks Colliery in Barnsley where both lamps were in use. Following a sudden strong influx of gas the tops of all the Davy Lamps became red hot (which had in the past caused an explosion, and in so doing risked another), whilst all the Geordie Lamps simply went out.\n\nThere is a theory that it was Stephenson who indirectly gave the name of [[Geordie]]s to the people of the North East of England. By this theory, the name of the Geordie Lamp attached to the North East pit men themselves. By 1866 any native of Newcastle upon Tyne could be called a Geordie.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|chapter=Geordie}}</ref>\n\n==Early locomotives==\nCornishman [[Richard Trevithick]] is credited with the first realistic design for a steam locomotive in 1802. Later, he visited [[Tyneside]] and built an engine there for a mine-owner. Several local men were inspired by this, and designed their own engines.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n[[File:Killingworth-locomotive.jpg|thumb|Early Stephenson locomotive illustrated in [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''Lives of the Engineers'' (1862).<ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" /> <br>Described as an 1816 Killingworth Colliery locomotive, this is often claimed to be ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'', but more closely resembles the slightly later [[Hetton colliery railway]] locomotives, and their 1852 replica ''[[Lyons, Hetton colliery railway|Lyons]]'', which was still operating at Smiles' time. <ref name=\"Smiles, Lives of the Engineers, Stephenson, 43\" />]]\nStephenson designed his first locomotive in 1814, a travelling engine designed for hauling coal on the Killingworth wagonway named ''[[Bl\u00fccher (locomotive)|Bl\u00fccher]]'' after the [[Prussia]]n general [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]] (It was suggested the name sprang from Bl\u00fccher's rapid march of his army in support of Wellington at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]).{{efn-lr|Recent scholarship holds that Stephenson's ''My Lord'' of 1814 pre-dated ''Bl\u00fccher''<ref name=\"Bailey, Stephenson\" />}} ''Bl\u00fccher'' was modelled on [[Matthew Murray]]\u2019s locomotive ''Willington'', which George studied at Kenton and Coxlodge colliery on Tyneside, and was constructed in the colliery workshop behind Stephenson's home, Dial Cottage, on Great Lime Road. The locomotive could haul 30 tons of coal up a hill at {{convert|4|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and was the first successful flanged-wheel adhesion locomotive: its traction depended on contact between its flanged wheels and the rail. \n\nAltogether, Stephenson is said to have produced 16 locomotives at Killingworth,<ref name=\"Davies\"/> although it has not proved possible to produce a convincing list of all 16. Of those identified, most were built for use at Killingworth or for the [[Hetton colliery railway]]. A six-wheeled locomotive was built for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]] in 1817 but was withdrawn from service because of damage to the cast-iron rails.<ref>Smiles (1857)</ref> Another locomotive was supplied to Scott's Pit railroad at [[Llansamlet]], near [[Swansea]], in 1819 but it too was withdrawn, apparently because it was under-boilered and again caused damage to the track.<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul |last=Reynolds |chapter=George Stephenson's 1819 Llansamlet locomotive | editor-first=M.J.T. |editor-last=Lewis |title=Early Railways 2: papers from the Second International Early Railways Conference |location=London |publisher=Newcomen Society |date=2003 |pages=165\u201376}}</ref>\n\n[[File:stephenson-rail-patent.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fishbelly rail]] with half-lap joint, patented by Stephenson 1816]]\nThe new engines were too heavy to run on wooden rails or plate-way, and iron edge rails were in their infancy, with [[cast iron]] exhibiting excessive brittleness. Together with [[William Losh]], Stephenson improved the design of cast-iron edge rails to reduce breakage; rails were briefly made by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] at their Walker ironworks. \n\nAccording to Rolt, Stephenson managed to solve the problem caused by the weight of the engine on the primitive rails. He experimented with a [[steam spring]] (to 'cushion' the weight using steam pressure acting on pistons to support the locomotive frame), but soon followed the practice of 'distributing' weight by using a number of wheels or bogies. For the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] Stephenson used [[wrought-iron]] malleable rails that he had found satisfactory, notwithstanding the financial loss he suffered by not using his own patented design.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nock|first=Oswald|authorlink=O.

He used a combination of gravity on downward inclines and locomotives for level and upward stretches. This, the first railway using no animal power, opened in 1822. This line used a gauge of {{railgauge|4ft8in|lk=on}} which Stephenson had used before at the [[Killingworth]] wagonway.<ref name=\"jones\">{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Robin|title=The Rocket Men|date=2013|publisher=Mortons Media Group|isbn=978-1909128255|page=33}}</ref>\n\nOther locomotives include:\n* 1817\u20131824 ''The Duke'' for the [[Kilmarnock and Troon Railway]]\n\n==Stockton and Darlington Railway==\n[[File:Stephenson-No.1-engine.jpg|thumb|The No. 1 engine, called ''Locomotion'', for the Stockton & Darlington Railway]]\nIn 1821, a parliamentary bill was passed to allow the building of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] (S&DR). The {{convert|25|mi|km|sing=on}} railway connected collieries near [[Bishop Auckland]] to the [[River Tees]] at [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], passing through [[Darlington]] on the way. The original plan was to use horses to draw coal carts on metal rails, but after company director [[Edward Pease (1767-1858)|Edward Pease]] met Stephenson, he agreed to change the plans.\nStephenson surveyed the line in 1821, and assisted by his eighteen-year-old son Robert, construction began the same year.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n[[File:Stephenson-Experiment-.jpg|thumb|The Experiment \u2013 the first railway carriage]]\nA manufacturer was needed to provide the locomotives for the line. Pease and Stephenson had jointly established a company in Newcastle to manufacture locomotives. It was set up as [[Robert Stephenson and Company]], and George's son Robert was the managing director. A fourth partner was Michael Longridge of [[Bedlington Ironworks]].<ref name=\"Davies\"/> On an early trade card, Robert Stephenson & Co was described as \"Engineers, Millwrights & Machinists, Brass & Iron Founders\".<ref name=EllisandMorse>{{cite book |title=Steaming through Britain |first1=Chris |last1=Ellis |first2=Greg |last2=Morse |publisher=Conway |location=London |year=2010 |page=47 |isbn=978-1-84486-121-7}}</ref> In September 1825 the works at Forth Street, Newcastle completed the first locomotive for the railway: originally named ''Active'', it was renamed ''[[Locomotion No 1|Locomotion]]'' and was followed by ''Hope'', ''Diligence'' and ''Black Diamond''. The Stockton and Darlington Railway opened on 27 September 1825. Driven by Stephenson, ''Locomotion'' hauled an 80-ton load of coal and flour {{convert|9|mi|km|spell=in}} in two hours, reaching a speed of {{convert|24|mph|km/h|abbr=off}} on one stretch. The first purpose-built passenger car, ''Experiment'', was attached and carried dignitaries on the opening journey. It was the first time passenger traffic had been run on a steam locomotive railway.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe rails used for the line were [[wrought-iron]], produced by [[John Birkinshaw]] at the [[Bedlington Ironworks]]. Wrought-iron rails could be produced in longer lengths than [[cast-iron]] and were less liable to crack under the weight of heavy locomotives. [[William Losh]] of Walker Ironworks thought he had an agreement with Stephenson to supply cast-iron rails, and Stephenson's decision caused a permanent rift between them. The gauge Stephenson chose for the line was {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm}} which subsequently was adopted as the standard gauge for railways, not only in Britain, but throughout the world.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Liverpool and Manchester Railway==\n[[File:George Stephenson - National Railway Museum - 2005-10-15.jpg|thumb|Statue of George Stephenson at the [[National Railway Museum]], [[York]]]]\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|First passenger railway, L&MR]]\nStephenson had ascertained by experiments at Killingworth that half the power of the locomotive was consumed by a gradient as little as 1 in 260.<ref>{{harvnb|Smiles|1862|p=244}}</ref> He concluded that railways should be kept as level as possible. He used this knowledge while working on the [[Bolton and Leigh Railway]], and the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), executing a series of difficult cuttings, embankments and stone viaducts to level their routes. Defective surveying of the original route of the L&MR caused by hostility from some affected landowners meant Stephenson encountered difficulty during Parliamentary scrutiny of the original bill, especially under [[cross-examination]] by [[Edward Alderson (judge)|Edward Hall Alderson]]. The bill was rejected and a revised bill for a new alignment was submitted and passed in a subsequent session. The revised alignment presented the problem of crossing [[Chat Moss]], an apparently bottomless peat bog, which Stephenson overcame by unusual means, effectively floating the line across it.<ref name=\"Davies\"/> The method he used was similar to that used by [[John Metcalf (civil engineer)|John Metcalf]] who constructed many miles of road across marshes in the Pennines, laying a foundation of heather and branches, which became bound together by the weight of the passing coaches, with a layer of stones on top.\n\nAs the L&MR approached completion in 1829, its directors arranged a competition to decide who would build its locomotives, and the [[Rainhill Trials]] were run in October 1829. Entries could weigh no more than six tons and had to travel along the track for a total distance of {{convert|60|mi|km}}. Stephenson's entry was ''[[Stephenson's Rocket|Rocket]]'', and its performance in winning the contest made it famous. George's son Robert had been working in South America from 1824 to 1827 and returned to run the Forth Street Works while George was in [[Liverpool]] overseeing the construction of the line. Robert was responsible for the detailed design of ''Rocket'', although he was in constant postal communication with his father, who made many suggestions. One significant innovation, suggested by [[Henry Booth]], treasurer of the L&MR, was the use of a [[fire-tube boiler]], invented by French engineer [[Marc Seguin]] that gave improved heat exchange.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nThe [[Opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway|opening ceremony of the L&MR]], on 15 September 1830, drew luminaries from the government and industry, including the Prime Minister, the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]]. The day started with a procession of eight trains setting out from Liverpool. The parade was led by ''[[Northumbrian (locomotive)|Northumbrian]]'' driven by George Stephenson, and included ''Phoenix'' driven by his son Robert, ''North Star'' driven by his brother Robert and ''Rocket'' driven by assistant engineer [[Joseph Locke]]. The day was marred by the death of [[William Huskisson]], the Member of Parliament for Liverpool, who was struck by ''Rocket''. Stephenson evacuated the injured Huskisson to [[Eccles, Greater Manchester|Eccles]] with a train, but he died from his injuries. Despite the tragedy, the railway was a resounding success. Stephenson became famous, and was offered the position of chief engineer for a wide variety of other railways.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\n==Stephenson's skew arch bridge==\n[[File:Stephensonbridge1.jpg|left|thumb|Stephenson's bridge]]\n[[File:StephensonBridgeClose.jpg|right|thumb|A close-up of the technique]]\n\n1830 also saw the grand opening of the [[skew arch|skew bridge]] in Rainhill over the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The bridge was the first to cross any railway at an angle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rainhillparish.org.uk/history/railway_history.html |title=Railway History |website=Rainhill Parish Council }}</ref> It required the structure to be constructed as two flat planes (overlapping in this case by {{convert|6|ft|abbr=on}}) between which the stonework forms a parallelogram shape when viewed from above. It has the effect of flattening the arch and the solution is to lay the bricks forming the arch at an angle to the abutments (the piers on which the arches rest). The technique, which results in a spiral effect in the arch masonry, provides extra strength in the arch to compensate for the angled abutments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simmons, Jack  |author2=Biddle, Gordon | title=The Oxford companion to British railway history | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1997 | pages=45\u201347 |isbn=0-19-211697-5}}</ref>\n\nThe bridge is still in use at [[Rainhill railway station|Rainhill station]], and carries traffic on the [[A57 road|A57]] (Warrington Road). The bridge is a [[Listed building|listed structure]].\n\n==Life at Alton Grange==\n[[File:George Stephenson's House at Alton Grange.jpg|thumb|Stephenson's House at Alton Grange]]\n\nGeorge Stephenson moved to the parish of [[Alton, Leicestershire|Alton]] Grange (now part of Ravenstone) in Leicestershire in 1830, originally to consult on the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]], a line primarily proposed to take coal from the western coal fields of the county to Leicester. The promoters of the line Mr [[William Stenson]] and [[John Ellis (businessman)|Mr John Ellis]], had difficulties in raising the necessary capital as the majority of local wealth had been invested in canals. Realising the potential and need for the rail link Stephenson himself invested \u00a32,500 and raised the remaining capital through his network of connections in Liverpool. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was made chief engineer with the first part of the line opening in 1832.\n\nDuring this same period the [[Snibston]] estate in Leicestershire came up for auction, it lay adjoining the proposed Swannington to Leicester route and was believed to contain valuable coal reserves. Stephenson realising the financial potential of the site, given its proximity to the proposed rail link and the fact that the manufacturing town of Leicester was then being supplied coal by canal from Derbyshire, bought the estate.\n\nEmploying a previously used method of mining in the midlands called tubbing to access the deep coal seams, his success could not have been greater. Stephenson\u2019s coal mine delivered the first rail cars of coal into Leicester dramatically reducing the price of coal and saving the city some \u00a340,000 per annum.\n\nStephenson remained at Alton Grange until 1838 before moving to [[Tapton House]] in Derbyshire. \n<ref>The Life of George & Robert Stephenson by Samuel Smile 1857</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:George Stephenson - Project Gutenberg etext 13103.jpg|thumb|George Stephenson]]\nThe next ten years were the busiest of Stephenson's life as he was besieged with requests from railway promoters. Many of the first American railroad builders came to Newcastle to learn from Stephenson and the first dozen or so locomotives utilised there were purchased from the Stephenson shops. Stephenson's conservative views on the capabilities of locomotives meant he favoured circuitous routes and civil engineering that were more costly than his successors thought necessary. For example, rather than the [[West Coast Main Line]] taking the direct route favoured by [[Joseph Locke]] over [[Lancaster and Carlisle Railway|Shap]] between [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster]] and [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], Stephenson was in favour of a longer sea-level route via [[Ulverston]] and [[Whitehaven]]. Locke's route was built. \n\nStephenson tended to be more casual in estimating costs and paperwork in general. He worked with Joseph Locke on the [[Grand Junction Railway]] with half of the line allocated to each man. Stephenson's estimates and organising ability proved inferior to those of Locke and the board's dissatisfaction led to Stephenson's resignation causing a rift between them which was never healed.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDespite Stephenson's loss of some routes to competitors due to his caution, he was offered more work than he could cope with, and was unable to accept all that was offered. He worked on the [[North Midland Railway|North Midland]] line from [[Derby]] to [[Leeds]], the [[York and North Midland Railway|York and North Midland]] line from Normanton to York, the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway|Manchester and Leeds]], the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway|Birmingham and Derby]], the [[Sheffield and Rotherham Railway|Sheffield and Rotherham]] among many others.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nStephenson became a reassuring name rather than a cutting-edge technical adviser.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} He was the first president of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] on its formation in 1847. By this time he had settled into semi-retirement, supervising his mining interests in Derbyshire \u2013 tunnelling for the [[North Midland Railway]] revealed coal seams, and Stephenson put money into their exploitation.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGeorge first courted Elizabeth (Betty) Hindmarsh, a farmer's daughter from Black Callerton, whom he met secretly in her orchard. Her father refused marriage because of Stephenson's lowly status as a miner.<ref>Samuel Smiles disputes this account, saying that Miss Hindmarsh's brother assured him that she didn't meet him before 1818 or 1819. See ''Lives of the Engineers'' 1862 vol 3. p116 (footnote).\n</ref> George next paid attention to Anne Henderson where he lodged with her family, but she rejected him and he transferred his attentions to her sister Frances (Fanny), who was nine years his senior. George and Fanny married at [[Newburn]] Church on 28 November 1802. They had two children Robert (1803) and Fanny (1805) but the latter died within months. George's wife died, probably of tuberculosis, the year after. While George was working in Scotland, Robert was brought up by a succession of neighbours and then by George's unmarried sister Eleanor (Nelly), who lived with them in Killingworth on George's return.\n\nOn 29 March 1820, George (now considerably wealthier) married Betty Hindmarsh at Newburn. The marriage seems to have been happy, but there were no children and Betty died on 3 August 1845.<Ref>http://www.engineering-timelines.com/who/Stephenson_G/stephensonGeorge8.asp</ref>\n\nOn 11 January 1848, at St John's Church in [[Shrewsbury]], Shropshire, George married for the third time, to Ellen Gregory, another farmer's daughter originally from [[Bakewell]] in Derbyshire, who had been his housekeeper. Seven months after his wedding, George contracted [[pleurisy]] and died, aged 67, at noon on 12 August 1848<Ref>Derbyshire Courier - 19 August 1848</ref> at [[Tapton House]] in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. He was buried at [[Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield]], alongside his second wife.<ref name=\"Davies\"/>\n\nDescribed by Rolt as a generous man, Stephenson financially supported the wives and families of several who had died in his employment, due to accident or misadventure, some within his family, and some not. He was also a keen gardener throughout his life; during his last years at Tapton House, he built hothouses in the estate gardens, growing exotic fruits and vegetables in a 'not too friendly' rivalry with [[Joseph Paxton]]'s father, head gardener at nearby [[Chatsworth House]], twice beating the master of the craft.\n\n===Descendants===\nGeorge Stephenson had two children. His son [[Robert Stephenson|Robert]] was born on 16 October 1803. Robert married Frances Sanderson, daughter of a City of London professional John Sanderson, on 17 June 1829. Robert died in 1859 having no children. Robert Stephenson expanded on the work of his father and became a major railway engineer himself. Abroad, Robert was involved in the Alexandria\u2013Cairo railway that later connected with the [[Suez Canal]]. George Stephenson's daughter was born in 1805 but died within weeks of her birth. Descendants of the wider Stephenson family continue to live in Wylam (Stephenson's birthplace) today. Also relatives connected by his marriage live in Derbyshire. Some descendants later emigrated to Perth, Australia, with later generations remaining to this day.\n\n==Legacy==\nBritain led the world in the development of railways which acted as a stimulus for the [[Industrial Revolution]] by facilitating the transport of raw materials and manufactured goods. George Stephenson, with his work on the Stockton and Darlington Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, paved the way for the railway engineers who followed, such as his son Robert, his assistant [[Joseph Locke]] who carried out much work on his own account and [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. Stephenson was farsighted in realising that the individual lines being built would eventually be joined together, and would need to have the same gauge. The [[standard gauge]] used throughout much of the world is due to him. In 2002, Stephenson was named in the [[BBC]]'s television show and list of the ''[[100 Greatest Britons]]'' following a UK-wide vote, placing at no. 65.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html |title=100 great Britons \u2013 A complete list |newspaper=Daily Mail |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Victorian self-help advocate [[Samuel Smiles]] had published his first biography of George Stephenson in 1857, and although attacked as biased in the favour of George at the expense his rivals as well as his son, it was popular and 250,000 copies were sold by 1904. The [[Band of Hope]] were selling biographies of George in 1859 at a penny a sheet, and at one point there was a suggestion to move George's body to Westminster Abbey.{{sfn|Davies|1975|pp=288\u2013290}}{{sfn|Rolt|1984|p=ix}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rocket Men: George and Robert Stephenson|editor=Jones, Robin|year=2013|publisher=Morton's Media|isbn=978-1-909128-27-9|page=23}}</ref> The centenary of George's birth was celebrated in 1881 at [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] by 15,000 people,{{sfn|Davies|1975|p=295}} and it was George who was featured on the reverse of the Series E [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|five pound note]] issued by the [[Bank of England]] between 1990 and 2003.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/withdrawn_notes.aspx | title=Notes recently withdrawn from circulation | publisher=Bank of England | accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> The [[Stephenson Railway Museum]] in [[North Shields]] is named after George and Robert Stephenson.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/stephenson/about-us.html | title=Join the railway revolution (about us) | publisher=Stephenson Railway Museum | year=2014 | accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Memorials and commemorations==\n\n[[File:George Stephenson - geograph.org.uk - 2315455.jpg|thumb|right|George Stephenson statue, Chesterfield March 2011]]\n[[George Stephenson's Birthplace]] is an 18th-century [[historic house museum]] in the village of [[Wylam]], and is operated by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

It further stated however that the sergeant was limited by lack of experience and resources (including psychologists, solicitors, dogs), and recommended a review of {{lang|ga|Garda}} command structures, and that the ERU be equipped with stun guns and other non-lethal options.

{"title_page": "UHF CB", "text_new": "'''UHF CB''' is a class-licensed [[citizen's band|citizen's band radio]] service authorised by the governments of [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Malaysia]] in the [[UHF]] 477&nbsp;MHz [[band (radio)|band]].<ref>Jim Sinclair ''Radio Signal Finding''\nMcGraw-Hill Professional, 2000 {{ISBN|0-07-137191-5}} page 281</ref>  UHF CB provides 77 [[communication channel|channels]], including 32 channels (16 output, 16 input) allocated to repeater stations. It is similar in concept to [[CB usage in the United States|27 MHz CB Radio]] in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nClass licensing means that users do not have to apply for a licence or pay a licence fee however they must comply with the regulations of the class licence.<ref>http://www.acma.gov.au/Citizen/TV-Radio/Radio/Marine-and-Amateur-Radio/citizen-band-radio-service-cbrs-fact-sheet</ref>\n\nUser equipment designs are similar to commercial land mobile [[two-way radio]] except the maximum legal output power is 5 [[Watt]]s. External antennas are permitted and commercially manufactured antennas have gains as high as 12&nbsp;dB. Handheld transceivers (walkie talkies) are permitted and have transmit power from 500&nbsp;mW to 5 W (full legal power) and are relatively cheap compared to full-sized transceivers. Operation in the band is restricted to [[Types of radio emissions|modes]] F3E and G3E ([[Frequency modulation|FM]] or [[Phase modulation|PM]] of analogue voice telephony) except for channels 22 and 23, which are data modes only.<ref>https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2015L00876</ref>\n\nIt is illegal to use non-standard radios purchased from overseas because they interfere with licensed land-mobile services. This includes overseas [[personal radio service]] devices because they do not share the same band plan, power output and channels as UHF CB. Care must be taken when importing radios from overseas to ensure they comply with local regulations. Approved radios are identified by an Australian standards C Tick usually found on the tag or sticker of the radio.\n\n==Scan==\nMany UHF CB radios allow the user to scan channels to find a conversation. Several different scan modes may be provided:\n\n'''Open Scan''' scans all 80 channels to find an active conversation. Some radios allow skipping selected channels when scanning.\n\n'''Group Scan''' scans a small number of selected channels. For example, a caravanner travelling around the country may choose to group scan Channel 40 (Road Channel), 18 (Caravan Channel) and 5 (Emergency Channel) so they will hear any conversations relating to their travels.\n\n'''Priority Scan''' allows selection of a \"priority\" channel whilst scanning a handful of selected channels. This could be useful in a convoy of cars where vehicles can set their own convoy channel as a priority channel whilst scanning the designated road channel for traffic updates, if a member from their convoy speaks, the radio will always switch back to the priority channel even if someone is speaking on another channel.\n\n==Selcall==\nSelective calling ([[Selcall]]) allows a radio to call another radio using a sequence of tones, usually presented to the user as a series of 5 numbers. UHF CB radios can be set to be completely silent until they receive a series of tones matching a pre-programmed sequence. Radios which have this feature usually indicate that a call has been received by emitting a number of beeps and by opening the squelch. The popularity of selcall has dropped since the introduction of CTCSS.\n\n==CTCSS==\nContinuous tone coded squelch system ([[CTCSS]]) allows a group of radios set with the same tone to converse on a channel without hearing other radios using that channel. CTCSS can be used to silence a radio until another radio with the same tone transmits. This allows monitoring of a channel for transmissions from radios set with the same tone without hearing other conversations that use different or even no tone.\n\nThe use of CTCSS is not permitted on UHF CB repeaters or the designated emergency channels.\n\n==Repeaters==\n[[Radio repeater|Repeaters]] extend the range of transmission by receiving and automatically rebroadcasting a transmission using an antenna located in a high location, normally the top of a mountain, tall building or radio tower. Sometimes a transmission range of over 100&nbsp;kilometres (60 miles) can be achieved through the use of a repeater. Repeaters are on channels 1\u20138 and 41\u201348 and the duplex button should be pressed to access the repeater.<ref>http://www.uhfcb.com.au/CB-Radio-History.php CB radio History</ref>\n\n==Signage==\nIt is common practice to install signs at the rear of camper vans and caravans, worksites, roadworks, regional highways, national parks and heavy vehicle checking stations to advertise a UHF channel to communicate on. For example, during the widening of the M1 Pacific Motorway between Sydney and Newcastle, contractors installed \"UHF 29\" signs at the entry point to each worksite.\n\n==Channel use==\n\n===Legally restricted channels===\nThe following channels are legislated as a part of the ACMA UHF CB Class Licence.<ref>https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2015L00876</ref>\n\n* '''Channel 5''' and '''35''' are the designated emergency channels in Australia, Vanuatu and Malaysia, and are not to be used except in an emergency. Making an emergency call involves switching the radio to Channel 5 with duplex on, and trying again with duplex off if there's no response. In New Zealand channels 5 and 35 are not emergency channels, they are available for general use in duplex (repeater) mode. In New Zealand, if you use UHF PRS for emergency, you rely on someone listening on the same channel. Scan all channels for activity before requesting assistance.\n* '''Channel 9''' is the designated emergency channel in Malaysia.\n* '''Channel 11''' is the 'call channel' and is only to be used for initiating calls with another person, who should quickly organise another vacant channel to continue their discussion on.\n* '''Channel 22''' and '''23''' are only to be used for telemetry and telecommand.  Packet data and voice transmission are not allowed.\n* '''Channel 61''', '''62''' and '''63''' are reserved for future allocation and transmission on these channels is not allowed.\n\n===Channels used by consensus===\nThe following channels are not legislated as a part of the class licence however are used for the following purposes by consensus.\n\n* '''Channel 10''' is typically used by 4WD clubs when in a convoy and in national parks. This channel is used to avoid interfering with road safety communications on channel 29 or 40. If you are not in a convoy it is recommended that only 29 or 40 are used, depending on the road in question.\n* '''Channel 18''' is the campers and caravan convoy channel typically used by travellers.\n* '''Channel 29''' is the road safety channel on the M1 Pacific Motorway and Highway between Tweed Heads and Newcastle in NSW. It is used due to one transport company who travelled this road who always used this channel. Other drivers switched from 40 to 29 to talk to them and it became a custom. This custom prevails even though the original transport company no longer exists.\n* '''Channel 40''' is the primary road safety channel Australia-wide, most commonly used by trucks including pilot/escort vehicles for oversized loads.<ref>https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Final%20PDF%20version%20-%20OSOM%20Loads%5E2C%20Pilots%20and%20Escort%20vehicles%20brochure.RCN-D13%5E23398873.PDF</ref><ref>http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/rti/policies/documents/Circular%202-2014.pdf</ref>\n\nUsers should be aware that UHF CB channels 31 to 38 and 71 to 78 are the 'input' channels for repeaters. Users should avoid using these channels to avoid interfering with repeaters. If a repeater is to be used, switch to 1\u20138 or 41\u201348 and press the duplex button.\n\n==UHF CB band plan==\n\n===Expansion to 80 channels===\nOn 27 May 2011 the channel spacing on UHF CB was changed, allowing the band to expand from 40 channels to 80 channels.<ref>http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_287</ref> Due to data channels 22 and 23 occupying 25&nbsp;kHz bandwidth, the expansion effectively allows the use of 77 channels, as channels 61, 62 and 63 are reserved.\n\n===Current UHF CB band plan (80 Channels)===\nGeneral chat channels are used in simplex mode, repeater channels must be used in duplex mode. If you are not using a repeater it is recommended to choose a \"general chat\" channel.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! Channel Name: !!

Sometimes a transmission range of over 100&nbsp;kilometres (60 miles) can be achieved through the use of a repeater. Repeaters are on channels 1\u20138 and 41\u201348 and the duplex button should be pressed to access the repeater.<ref>http://www.uhfcb.com.au/CB-Radio-History.php CB radio History</ref>\n\n==Signage==\nIt is common practice to install signs at the rear of camper vans and caravans, worksites, roadworks, regional highways, national parks and heavy vehicle checking stations to advertise a UHF channel to communicate on. For example, during the widening of the M1 Pacific Motorway between Sydney and Newcastle, contractors installed \"UHF 29\" signs at the entry point to each worksite.\n\n==Channel use==\n\n===Legally restricted channels===\nThe following channels are legislated as a part of the ACMA UHF CB Class Licence.<ref>https://www.legislation.gov.au/Latest/F2015L00876</ref>\n\n* '''Channel 5''' and '''35''' are the designated emergency channels in Australia, Vanuatu and Malaysia, and are not to be used except in an emergency. Making an emergency call involves switching the radio to Channel 5 with duplex on, and trying again with duplex off if there's no response. In New Zealand channels 5 and 35 are not emergency channels, they are available for general use in duplex (repeater) mode. In New Zealand, if you use UHF PRS for emergency, you rely on someone listening on the same channel. Scan all channels for activity before requesting assistance.\n* '''Channel 9''' is the designated emergency channel in Malaysia.\n* '''Channel 11''' is the 'call channel' and is only to be used for initiating calls with another person, who should quickly organise another vacant channel to continue their discussion on.\n* '''Channel 22''' and '''23''' are only to be used for telemetry and telecommand.  Packet data and voice transmission are not allowed.\n* '''Channel 61''', '''62''' and '''63''' are reserved for future allocation and transmission on these channels is not allowed.\n\n===Channels used by consensus===\nThe following channels are not legislated as a part of the class licence however are used for the following purposes by consensus.\n\n* '''Channel 10''' is typically used by 4WD clubs when in a convoy and in national parks. This channel is used to avoid interfering with road safety communications on channel 29 or 40. If you are not in a convoy it is recommended that only 29 or 40 are used, depending on the road in question.\n* '''Channel 18''' is the campers and caravan convoy channel typically used by travellers.\n* '''Channel 29''' is the road safety channel on the M1 Pacific Motorway and Highway between Tweed Heads and Newcastle in NSW. It is used due to one transport company who travelled this road who always used this channel. Other drivers switched from 40 to 29 to talk to them and it became a custom. This custom prevails even though the original transport company no longer exists.\n* '''Channel 40''' is the primary road safety channel Australia-wide, most commonly used by trucks including pilot/escort vehicles for oversized loads.<ref>https://www.mainroads.wa.gov.au/Documents/Final%20PDF%20version%20-%20OSOM%20Loads%5E2C%20Pilots%20and%20Escort%20vehicles%20brochure.RCN-D13%5E23398873.PDF</ref><ref>http://www.police.qld.gov.au/Resources/Internet/rti/policies/documents/Circular%202-2014.pdf</ref>\n\nUsers should be aware that UHF CB channels 31 to 38 and 71 to 78 are the 'input' channels for repeaters. Users should avoid using these channels to avoid interfering with repeaters. If a repeater is to be used, switch to 1\u20138 or 41\u201348 and press the duplex button.\n\n==UHF CB band plan==\n\n===Expansion to 80 channels===\nOn 27 May 2011 the channel spacing on UHF CB was changed, allowing the band to expand from 40 channels to 80 channels.<ref>http://www.acma.gov.au/WEB/STANDARD/pc=PC_287</ref> Due to data channels 22 and 23 occupying 25&nbsp;kHz bandwidth, the expansion effectively allows the use of 77 channels, as channels 61, 62 and 63 are reserved.\n\n===Current UHF CB band plan (80 Channels)===\nGeneral chat channels are used in simplex mode, repeater channels must be used in duplex mode. If you are not using a repeater it is recommended to choose a \"general chat\" channel.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin-left: 1em\"\n|-\n! Channel Name: !!

For its time, the G-body was one of the strongest unibody car frames in production (25&nbsp;Hz). This fact did not go untouted as GM literature made much of the need to use a 'frame crusher' designed to test heavy-duty truck frames to finally break the G-body structure in their crush-to-failure procedures.

Models designated as \"G\" went out of production for MY 1999, but successor models were sold until MY 2011. \n\nThe G-body had an extremely resilient structure. For its time, the G-body was one of the strongest unibody car frames in production (25&nbsp;Hz). This fact did not go untouted as GM literature made much of the need to use a 'frame crusher' designed to test heavy-duty truck frames to finally break the G-body structure in their crush-to-failure procedures. Vehicles built on the G platform are also noted for having [[Seat belt#Belt-in-Seat .28BIS.29|belt-in-seat]] style seat belts like the mid-size [[GMT360]] SUVs. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The G-body also featured four-wheel [[independent suspension]] with a [[MacPherson strut]] style front suspension and a [[semi-trailing arm]] style rear suspension that utilized [[aluminum]] control arms. All-new aluminum control arms were introduced for the front suspension for 1998. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The handling was further enhanced with standard front and rear [[stabilizer bar]]s and lateral links in the rear suspension to further control wheel [[Toe (automotive)|toe]]. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n===Vehicles===\n[[File:1999 Buick Riviera.jpg|250px|right|thumb|1999 Buick Riviera]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Years\n!Wheelbase\n!Model\n!Platform Name*\n|-\n|1995\u20131999||113.8&nbsp;in||[[Buick Riviera]]||GM G platform\n|-\n|1995\u20131999||113.8&nbsp;in||[[Oldsmobile Aurora]]||GM G platform\n|-\n|1997-2005||113.8&nbsp;in||[[Buick Park Avenue]]||[[GM C platform (1985)|GM C platform]]\n|-\n|1998\u20132004||112.2&nbsp;in||[[Cadillac Seville]]||[[GM K platform (1980)|GM K platform]]\n|-\n|2000\u20132005||112.2&nbsp;in||[[Buick LeSabre]]||[[GM H platform (1986)|GM H platform]]\n|-\n|2000\u20132005||112.2&nbsp;in||[[Pontiac Bonneville]]||[[GM H platform (1986)|GM H platform]]\n|-\n|2001\u20132003||112.2&nbsp;in||[[Oldsmobile Aurora]]||GM G platform\n|-\n|2000\u20132005||115.3&nbsp;in||[[Cadillac DeVille]]||[[GM K platform (1980)|GM K platform]]\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Official designation given by GM, despite using a G platform-derivative.
