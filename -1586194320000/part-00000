In contrast, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen had three times as many visitors.

The origins of the name ''Hawai'' can be traced back to at least the [[Kamakura period]]. One historical document written in 1258 details a peace settlement that divided the land in central Tottori, and it refers to the area of modern-day Hawai Town as \u201cHawaida\u201d (\u4f2f\u4e95\u7530). These characters were later changed to \u7fbd\u5408\u7530 (\"Hawaida\"). For example, [[Kikkawa Motoharu]] referred to the area this way in a letter written around 1580, during the [[Sengoku period]].<ref name=\"twelve\">{{cite book |title=\u300e\u9ce5\u53d6\u770c\u306e\u5730\u540d\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u6b74\u53f2\u5730\u540d\u5927\u7cfb\uff09\u300f |page=450-451 |chapter=\u300c\u7fbd\u5408\u753a\u300d}}</ref>\n===Early discovery and development of the ''onsen''===\nThe discovery of hot spring waters at Hawai Onsen was first recorded in 1843. Fishermen discovered that hot spring water flowed out from the bottom of T\u014dg\u014d Lake, so local villagers requested permission from the [[Tottori Domain]] to use it. At the time, using hot spring water reduced the need to gather firewood for water heating. Thus, the domain anticipated that this ''onsen'' water would cause an increase in farming efficiency, so it granted permission to the villagers. This was the beginning of Hawai Onsen.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"seven\">{{cite book |title=\u300e\u9ce5\u53d6\u770c\u306e\u5730\u540d\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u6b74\u53f2\u5730\u540d\u5927\u7cfb\uff09\u300f |page=456 |chapter=\u300c\u7fbd\u5408\u6e29\u6cc9\u300d}}</ref>\n\nThe ''onsen''\u2019s development was pioneered by K\u014dsuke Yumura, a man from [[Iwami Province]] who is said to be a descendant of a ''[[samurai]]'' family. In 1866, Yumura inserted bamboo tubes into the bottom of T\u014dg\u014d Lake, extracting the hot spring water and funneling it into barrels in a boat. This water was used to make a bath on the surface of the lake, which was known as ''\u201cAozora yuba\u201d'', and it existed until the start of the [[Meiji Period]]. It fell out of use in 1880 due a variety of issues, such as rough waves rocking the boats and drifting them away. Around 1886, Yumura filled in parts of the lakeshore area and excavated some of this reclaimed land. He successfully located a hot spring source, and subsequently opened his own ''ryokan'' with an ''onsen'' attached.<ref name=\"six\" />\u3000This ''ryokan'' was built in the former village of Asozu, so the area was referred to as \u201cAsozu Onsen\u201d and \u201cOs\u014dzu Onsen\u201d.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"six\" /><ref name=\"seven\" />\n===Modern development of the ''onsen''===\n[[File:Matsuzaki Station (Tottori), ekisha.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Matsuzaki Station (Tottori)|Matsuzaki Station]]]]\nThe [[San'in Main Line]] was completed in Tottori Prefecture during the late Meiji Period. As a result, greater numbers of people from the [[Kansai region]] of Japan began to visit the prefecture as ''onsen'' tourists. This led to an increase in visitors to ''onsen'' districts that were close to the train line. T\u014dg\u014d Onsen became one of the most popular ''onsen'' districts in the prefecture due to its convenient location by [[Matsuzaki Station (Tottori)|Matsuzaki Station]].<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web |title=web\u7248\u6771\u90f7\u753a\u8a8c \u990a\u751f\u9928\u306e\u5275\u696d |url=http://www.yurihama.jp/town_history2/2hen/4syo/06010400.htm |website=Yurihama Town Website |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Asozu Onsen was comparatively inconvenient to reach, being on a separate shore of T\u014dg\u014d Lake away from Matsuzaki Station and T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. However, soon a boat route transporting visitors to Asozu Onsen was created, leading to increased development of the ''onsen'' district there during the [[Taish\u014d period]].<ref name=\"three\" /> In 1927, Asozu Onsen was renamed Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen (\u201cNew T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u201d).\n[[File:Hawai onsen.jpg|thumb|200px|A sign for Hawai Onsen on Prefectural Road 199]]\n[[Motorization]] after the end of the [[Pacific War]] led to a rapid increase in visitors to Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. This was due to its proximity to [[Japan National Route 9|National Route 9]], which brought groups of travelers to the area via bus. From 1954 to 1980, the number of visitors to Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen increased 24-fold, and larger multi-story inns and hotels were built. More hot spring sources were also developed, which meant that private homes in the area also had access to this hot water supply.<ref name=\"six\" /> During this time, the tourism sector began to rapidly grow in nearby Hawai Town, which originally relied solely on agriculture. In 1978, Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen was renamed to Hawai Onsen (\u7fbd\u5408\u6e29\u6cc9) to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hawai Town\u2019s founding.<ref name=\"six\" /><ref name=\"seven\" /><ref name=\"twelve\" />\n\nIn 1998, the written characters for Hawai Onsen were officially changed to \u306f\u308f\u3044\u6e29\u6cc9.<ref name=\"eleven\" /> In October of 2004, Hawai Town merged with the neighboring [[T\u014dg\u014d, Tottori|T\u014dg\u014d Town]] and [[Tomari, Tottori|Tomari Village]]. The new town\u2019s name, Yurihama (\u6e6f\u68a8\u6d5c), includes a reference to Hawai Onsen and T\u014dg\u014d Onsen, as the town\u2019s first character, \u6e6f, means \u201chot water\u201d.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.

According to these figures, Hawai Onsen had around 10,000 visitors per year in 1954, the lowest for any ''onsen'' district in the prefecture. In contrast, T\u014dg\u014d Onsen had three times as many visitors. However, Hawai Onsen rapidly gained popularity in the 1980s, eventually surpassing its neighbor; at the start of the 1990s, Hawai Onsen was one of the most popular ''onsen'' districts in Tottori.<ref name=\"eleven\">{{cite web |title=\u9ce5\u53d6\u770c\u6587\u5316\u89b3\u5149\u5c40\u89b3\u5149\u653f\u7b56\u8ab2 \u89b3\u5149\u5ba2\u5165\u8fbc\u52d5\u614b\u8abf\u67fb\u7d50\u679c\uff08\u5e73\u621022\u5e74\uff09 |url=http://www.pref.tottori.lg.jp/secure/226510/h22toukei.pdf |website=Tottori Prefecture Web Site |accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref>\n==History==\n===Origins of the name \"Hawai\"===\nHawai Onsen is written in Japanese as \u306f\u308f\u3044\u6e29\u6cc9 (''Hawai onsen''); this was changed from the characters \u7fbd\u5408\u6e29\u6cc9 (''Hawai onsen'') to the current name in 1998 by [[Hawai, Tottori|Hawai Town]]. The origins of the name ''Hawai'' can be traced back to at least the [[Kamakura period]]. One historical document written in 1258 details a peace settlement that divided the land in central Tottori, and it refers to the area of modern-day Hawai Town as \u201cHawaida\u201d (\u4f2f\u4e95\u7530). These characters were later changed to \u7fbd\u5408\u7530 (\"Hawaida\"). For example, [[Kikkawa Motoharu]] referred to the area this way in a letter written around 1580, during the [[Sengoku period]].<ref name=\"twelve\">{{cite book |title=\u300e\u9ce5\u53d6\u770c\u306e\u5730\u540d\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u6b74\u53f2\u5730\u540d\u5927\u7cfb\uff09\u300f |page=450-451 |chapter=\u300c\u7fbd\u5408\u753a\u300d}}</ref>\n===Early discovery and development of the ''onsen''===\nThe discovery of hot spring waters at Hawai Onsen was first recorded in 1843. Fishermen discovered that hot spring water flowed out from the bottom of T\u014dg\u014d Lake, so local villagers requested permission from the [[Tottori Domain]] to use it. At the time, using hot spring water reduced the need to gather firewood for water heating. Thus, the domain anticipated that this ''onsen'' water would cause an increase in farming efficiency, so it granted permission to the villagers. This was the beginning of Hawai Onsen.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"four\" /><ref name=\"seven\">{{cite book |title=\u300e\u9ce5\u53d6\u770c\u306e\u5730\u540d\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u6b74\u53f2\u5730\u540d\u5927\u7cfb\uff09\u300f |page=456 |chapter=\u300c\u7fbd\u5408\u6e29\u6cc9\u300d}}</ref>\n\nThe ''onsen''\u2019s development was pioneered by K\u014dsuke Yumura, a man from [[Iwami Province]] who is said to be a descendant of a ''[[samurai]]'' family. In 1866, Yumura inserted bamboo tubes into the bottom of T\u014dg\u014d Lake, extracting the hot spring water and funneling it into barrels in a boat. This water was used to make a bath on the surface of the lake, which was known as ''\u201cAozora yuba\u201d'', and it existed until the start of the [[Meiji Period]]. It fell out of use in 1880 due a variety of issues, such as rough waves rocking the boats and drifting them away. Around 1886, Yumura filled in parts of the lakeshore area and excavated some of this reclaimed land. He successfully located a hot spring source, and subsequently opened his own ''ryokan'' with an ''onsen'' attached.<ref name=\"six\" />\u3000This ''ryokan'' was built in the former village of Asozu, so the area was referred to as \u201cAsozu Onsen\u201d and \u201cOs\u014dzu Onsen\u201d.<ref name=\"three\" /><ref name=\"six\" /><ref name=\"seven\" />\n===Modern development of the ''onsen''===\n[[File:Matsuzaki Station (Tottori), ekisha.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Matsuzaki Station]]]]\nThe [[San'in Main Line]] was completed in Tottori Prefecture during the late Meiji Period. As a result, greater numbers of people from the [[Kansai region]] of Japan began to visit the prefecture as ''onsen'' tourists. This led to an increase in visitors to ''onsen'' districts that were close to the train line. T\u014dg\u014d Onsen became one of the most popular ''onsen'' districts in the prefecture due to its convenient location by [[Matsuzaki Station]].<ref name=\"thirteen\">{{cite web |title=web\u7248\u6771\u90f7\u753a\u8a8c \u990a\u751f\u9928\u306e\u5275\u696d |url=http://www.yurihama.jp/town_history2/2hen/4syo/06010400.htm |website=Yurihama Town Website |accessdate=23 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, Asozu Onsen was comparatively inconvenient to reach, being on a separate shore of T\u014dg\u014d Lake away from Matsuzaki Station and T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. However, soon a boat route transporting visitors to Asozu Onsen was created, leading to increased development of the ''onsen'' district there during the [[Taish\u014d period]].<ref name=\"three\" /> In 1927, Asozu Onsen was renamed Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen (\u201cNew T\u014dg\u014d Onsen\u201d).\n[[File:Hawai onsen.jpg|thumb|200px|A sign for Hawai Onsen on Prefectural Road 199]]\n[[Motorization]] after the end of the [[Pacific War]] led to a rapid increase in visitors to Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen. This was due to its proximity to [[Japan National Route 9|National Route 9]], which brought groups of travelers to the area via bus. From 1954 to 1980, the number of visitors to Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen increased 24-fold, and larger multi-story inns and hotels were built. More hot spring sources were also developed, which meant that private homes in the area also had access to this hot water supply.<ref name=\"six\" /> During this time, the tourism sector began to rapidly grow in nearby Hawai Town, which originally relied solely on agriculture. In 1978, Shin-T\u014dg\u014d Onsen was renamed to Hawai Onsen (\u7fbd\u5408\u6e29\u6cc9) to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Hawai Town\u2019s founding.<ref name=\"six\" /><ref name=\"seven\" /><ref name=\"twelve\" />\n\nIn 1998, the written characters for Hawai Onsen were officially changed to \u306f\u308f\u3044\u6e29\u6cc9.<ref name=\"eleven\" /> In October of 2004, Hawai Town merged with the neighboring [[T\u014dg\u014d, Tottori|T\u014dg\u014d Town]] and [[Tomari, Tottori|Tomari Village]]. The new town\u2019s name, Yurihama (\u6e6f\u68a8\u6d5c), includes a reference to Hawai Onsen and T\u014dg\u014d Onsen, as the town\u2019s first character, \u6e6f, means \u201chot water\u201d.\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
