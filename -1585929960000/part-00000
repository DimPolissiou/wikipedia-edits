He bought a [[transistor radio]] and earphones and joined the \"under the bedclothes\" club, listening to [[Tony Hall (music executive)|Tony Hall]], [[Jimmy Savile]], Don Moss and [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]] on [[Radio Luxembourg]], and keeping track of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' charts.<ref name=King4/> The music, particularly [[Buddy Holly]], [[Adam Faith]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Gene Pitney]], made him \"ache with desire\":\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;\">\nSince \"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" swept me off my feet, I had become a raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds.

He wrote that he \"loved Charterhouse immediately\", with its history and \"every possible area of encouragement from sport to intellectual pursuits.\" Unlike at Stoke House, there were other boys there who appreciated pop music. He bought a [[transistor radio]] and earphones and joined the \"under the bedclothes\" club, listening to [[Tony Hall (music executive)|Tony Hall]], [[Jimmy Savile]], Don Moss and [[Pete Murray (DJ)|Pete Murray]] on [[Radio Luxembourg]], and keeping track of the ''[[New Musical Express]]'' charts.<ref name=King4/> The music, particularly [[Buddy Holly]], [[Adam Faith]], [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Gene Pitney]], made him \"ache with desire\":\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:5em; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 3px #ccc; padding:1.5em;\">\nSince \"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" swept me off my feet, I had become a raving pop addict, desperate for a fix every few seconds.
