It is a [[video game remake|remake]] of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' (1999) and follows [[Jill Valentine]] and [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]] as they attempt to survive a [[zombie apocalypse]] while hunted by the intelligent [[bioweapon]] [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis]]. It was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on April 3, 2020. It has an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance''. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, with its graphics, presentation, and gameplay receiving commendation. Most criticism was directed towards the game's length, pace, and absence of certain elements from the original game, such as the missing mercenary mode and epilogues.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Resident Evil 3'' is a remake of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', a [[survival horror]] video game released for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a dream and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters you assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]], who has been going through PTSD from the events of the mansion incident, is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]] who informs Jill that they are the only two S.T.A.R.S. members left in Raccoon City and that the monster is targeting them. They escape a swarm of zombies but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies and how the gate they used got suspiciously locked. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad before Carlos takes him out . The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and watch a video message from Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Bard also tells them that he knows the cure for the T-Virus, and has been seeing other scientists getting killed off by someone. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Nicholai appears and praises Jill's fighting ability before disappearing. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos, angry at Umbrella, retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos defends the hospital from a zombie attack before traveling to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Nicholai tells Jill he will give the vaccine back to her if she can defeat the Nemesis. Jill, with the help of Carlos, attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Carlos pursues Nicholai while Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Carlos is unconscious while Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos attacks Nicholai and restrains Nicholai long enough for Jill to shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if they allow him a seat on the helicopter. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai to his fate. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill becomes sentimental, looking at the destroyed vaccine case and promising to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, inside an apartment a mysterious person wearing green, picks up the destroyed vaccine case from a table and observes it.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to

On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]], who has been going through PTSD from the events of the mansion incident, is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]] who informs Jill that they are the only two S.T.A.R.S. members left in Raccoon City and that the monster is targeting them. They escape a swarm of zombies but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies and how the gate they used got suspiciously locked. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad before Carlos takes him out . The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and watch a video message from Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Bard also tells them that he knows the cure for the T-Virus, and has been seeing other scientists getting killed off by someone. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Nicholai appears and praises Jill's fighting ability before disappearing. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos, angry at Umbrella, retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos defends the hospital from a zombie attack before traveling to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by Umbrella to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Nicholai tells Jill he will give the vaccine back to her if she can defeat the Nemesis. Jill, with the help of Carlos, attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Carlos pursues Nicholai while Jill uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Carlos is unconscious while Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for hiding Umbrella's involvement. Carlos attacks Nicholai and restrains Nicholai long enough for Jill to shoot and incapacitate him. When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if they allow him a seat on the helicopter. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai to his fate. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill becomes sentimental, looking at the destroyed vaccine case and promising to take down Umbrella.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Jill picks up the destroyed vaccine case from a table and observes it.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its announcement in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|

He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

An ordinary high school student who was accepted to the academy by raffle. He has no spectacular talents, aside from his belief that he is a bit more optimistic than most people, and was given the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}} due to winning the lottery. Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}. He manages to escape from the academy alive and joins an organization called the Future Foundation, dedicated to rebuilding the world and fighting against Junko's legacy.\n\n:During the events of ''[[Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair|Danganronpa 2]]'', he and the other survivors attempt to rehabilitate some of the Remnants of Despair by placing them inside a virtual world which would rewrite their memories of being Ultimate Despair students. However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game. His forbidden action is \"running in the hallway.\" After surviving the Monokuma Hunter game, Makoto becomes the headmaster of the rebuilt Hope's Peak Academy.<ref name=\"anotherepappearance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|title=Danganronpa: Another Episode Has Danganronpa 1's Hero, Makoto Naegi, In It - Siliconera|work=Siliconera|accessdate=2 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230839/http://www.siliconera.com/2014/08/19/danganronpa-another-episode-familiar-faces-murder-mystery-games/|archive-date=2015-09-11|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n;{{nihongo|Kyoko Kirigiri|\u9727\u5207 \u97ff\u5b50|Kirigiri Ky\u014dko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Erika Harlacher]] (game), [[Caitlin Glass]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ErikaHarlacher/status/357985813117665280|title=Erika Harlacher on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414012713/https://twitter.com/erikaharlacher/status/357985813117665280|archive-date=2016-04-14|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The main heroine of the first game. Kyoko is a mysterious woman who seemingly has amnesia but also possesses a cool head and reasoning skills. At the beginning of the game, her talent is unknown, so her presented title is {{nihongo|Ultimate ???|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c???\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"???\"|Super High School Level ???}}.

She always wears a pair of gloves, which is later revealed to be for hiding burns scars she received on her hands when she was younger. She is also the daughter of Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster, Jin Kirigiri. She survives the game and manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.\n\n:In ''Danganronpa 2'', she joins Makoto and Byakuya in confronting Junko's Alter Ego. In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her. She then becomes a teacher at the new Hope's Peak Academy. She is the protagonist of the spinoff novel series ''Danganronpa Kirigiri'', where she, along with her friend Yui, become involved in a deadly game in an abandoned hotel.\n\n;{{nihongo|Byakuya Togami|\u5341\u795e \u767d\u591c|Togami Byakuya}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Akira Ishida]]|Jason Wishnov (game), [[Josh Grelle]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=71233166&postcount=461|title=NeoGAF|website=NeoGAF|language=en|access-date=2017-01-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412024351/http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=71233166&postcount=461|archive-date=2016-04-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:The successor of a highly successful family corporation who considers himself superior to all the other students in the academy. He is initially cold towards others, seeing them as competition and, as he hates losing, initially refuses to cooperate with their attempts at escaping and investigating. He soon identifies Makoto as a potential competitor, and after the second murder, alters the crime scene as a test for Makoto. Eventually, he becomes more amicable to the group, especially after Sakura's death. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.

A charismatic [[gyaru]] fashion model who has modeled for many popular magazines. She is thought to have been killed by Monokuma near the start of the game, having been impaled by several spears after assaulting Monokuma as punishment for breaking the school rules. It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support. By the time the survivors confront her, it is said that Junko has gone completely insane, her original personality long since lost in her psychosis. She is also the cause of the current state of the school and the world, having manipulated and brainwashed the school's disgruntled reserve course students into rioting over their unfair treatment, which the school desperately tried to cover up until it spilled out into the outside world and caused a worldwide uprising against those perceived as special or privileged. When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students. At the last second before her death, she becomes bored with despair and dies without knowing the despair of death she was so excited about mere seconds ago.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down. Her avatar appears as a fully three-dimensional giant version possessing a video cell phone that she uses to communicate with the students in the virtual world.

In the alternative story depicted in the ''Danganronpa IF'' digital novel included with ''Danganronpa 2'', Mukuro is saved from being killed by Junko thanks to Makoto and decides to turn against Junko and help everyone escape from the academy alive once she realizes that Junko is beyond saving.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She is a sleepy, laid-back student who is inexperienced in the ways of the world, but very skilled at video games. Along with Hajime, she becomes a central figure of the trials. She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict. Her title is {{nihongo|Ultimate Gamer|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"G\u0113m\u0101\"|Super High School Level Gamer}}.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', it is revealed that the AI program was based on an actual student who attended Hope's Peak Academy along with the rest of the 77th class of Hope's Peak. Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

It is revealed in Chapter 4 that she had been sold out by the orphanage and lived with a group of assassins, where she learned her skills in murder that earned her title. Throughout the game, she gradually becomes close with Shuichi and Kaito, the latter of whom she develops romantic feelings for, identifying him as the first person whom she has ever opened up to; like every other event in the game, however, this is revealed to be the result of the Danganronpa reality show's production team's machinations.

He quickly develops a brotherly bond with Shuichi and becomes interested in Maki in-game, going out of his way to protect them at all costs. Haunted by a chronic disease that is slowly killing him, he resolves to himself that he won't let himself die because of the killing game. Kaito murdered Kokichi at the latter's request in Chapter 5, and is sentenced to an execution in a similar fashion to that of Jin Kirigiri from the first game, but dies due to his chronic disease before he can be successfully executed. Prior to entering the killing game, Kaito appears to have had far less altruistic intentions, with him merely reiterating his desire for fame and fortune by killing on and winning the show in his interview.\n\n;{{nihongo|Himiko Yumeno|\u5922\u91ce \u79d8\u5bc6\u5b50|Yumeno Himiko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aimi Tanaka]]}} (Japanese), [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/881317421377740801|title=I voice Himiko Yumeno in Danganronpa V3!

She was diagnosed with [[Anterograde amnesia|a psychological disorder that causes her constant loss of short and long term memories]], forgetting things shortly after she learns them. Hence, she writes everything down in a notebook she carries with her at all times. She is in love with her neurologist, Yasuke Matsuda, whom she visits frequently for check-ups. It is eventually revealed that in actuality, Ryoko is nothing but a fake identity of Junko, the product of her experimentation with various memory-erasing techniques in preparation for the first mutual killing game. Upon learning the truth, Ryoko falls into despair and kills Yasuke, subsequently reassuming her true identity of Junko to spread despair once more.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yasuke Matsuda|\u677e\u7530 \u591c\u52a9|Matsuda Yasuke}}\n:The {{nihongo|Ultimate Neurologist|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u795e\u7d4c\u5b66\u8005\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Shinkei Gakusha\"}}, Ryoko's abrasive love interest and the one she visits for check-ups regarding her psychological state. Ironically, Yasuke is actually the cause of her current condition; he was roped into helping Junko test memory-wiping procedures prior to the events of the novels, and in doing so, removed all her memories and planted false ones in her notebook. He later catalyses Junko's reawakening, per her pre-experiment orders.

He is a strange, remote-controlled [[teddy bear]] who proclaims himself to be the headmaster of Hope's Peak Academy and initiates a life of mutual killing among the students. He has various copies of himself throughout the academy and will punish anyone that attempts to attack him or breaks the academy's rules.\n\nVisually, Monokuma is divided into two halves. Seen from the front his left half is a cute white teddy bear with black details and grey shading; his right half has black fur and adds red as a spot color applied to his eye\nto contribute to his sadistic appearance together with an evil smirk.\n\nThe identity of Monokuma's controller, as well as his motives for bringing the students together, are central to the mysteries that the students must investigate. It is revealed that Monokuma is actually a series of robots created by Monaca Towa for an army that Junko Enoshima used. In the first two games, Monokuma was used as a proxy for Junko in her trials; in ''Another Episode'', he is a series of different types of enemies; in ''Danganronpa 3'', he is under the control of Kazuo Tengan to force Ryota Mitarai into brainwashing the entire world for the sake of hope. He is the only returning character in ''Danganronpa V3'' as a part of the Ultimate Academy for Gifted Juveniles, now controlled by Tsumugi Shirogane and accompanied by the Monokuma Kubs.\n\n==''Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc''==\n<!-- The NIS America release uses \"Ultimate\" in place of \"Super High School Level\".

Ironically, he often falls prey to bad luck more often than not. It is revealed in a short story that Makoto's luck comes from the fact that his bad luck is so powerful that it cancels the good luck of anyone around him, to the point where he managed to get a fellow Lucky Student candidate eliminated just by standing near the mailman carrying her acceptance letter. However, it is also shown that though his good luck rarely manifests, it is immensely powerful in its own right, allowing outcomes that are nearly statistically impossible to occur, such as getting the Escape Switch from the item machine or surviving his near-execution. His talent also proves instrumental in undoing Junko's plans, as his bizarre luck completely throws off her analytical abilities. While having the tendency to panic or let his emotions get the better of him, he can remain focused under pressure and shows a keen logic when piecing together mysteries. He is instrumental in solving all of the murder mysteries, and foils Monokuma's plot, earning the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}.

However, because of a virus containing Junko's Alter Ego, the world is turned into another killing game, prompting Makoto, Kyoko and Byakuya to eventually enter the virtual world themselves to help the surviving students activate a shutdown sequence to stop Junko once and for all. Makoto also appears in ''[[Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls|Danganronpa Another Episode]]''. He returns as the protagonist of ''[[Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School|Danganronpa 3]]'', where he becomes involved in Monokuma's Monokuma Hunter game.

She always wears a pair of gloves, which is later revealed to be for hiding burns scars she received on her hands when she was younger. She is also the daughter of Hope's Peak Academy's headmaster, Jin Kirigiri. She survives the game and manages to escape from the academy and becomes a member of the Future Foundation.\n\n:In ''Danganronpa 2'', she joins Makoto and Byakuya in confronting Junko's Alter Ego. In ''Danganronpa 3'', she becomes involved in the Monokuma Hunter game alongside other Future Foundation members. She is presumably killed by the poison in her wristband as a result of her forbidden action, \"passing the fourth time limit with Makoto still alive.\" At the end of the series, it is revealed she had survived thanks to an antidote created by Seiko, which slowed the poison's effects and put her in a coma until Mikan revived her. She then becomes a teacher at the new Hope's Peak Academy.

It is soon revealed that she is actually the true mastermind behind the events of the game, who had erased the memories of all the students and put them in this death game. The one who was really killed was her twin sister, Mukuro Ikusaba. Her true personality is one that is constantly changing as she gets bored easily and thrives to drive people to despair. The strangeness of her true persona is also compounded by her having to play the role of Monokuma, who has a drastically different personality from her own, as well as the stress of running the Mutual Killing Game by herself without any kind of support.

When her plans are foiled by Makoto's dedication to never give up hope, she begins to revel in the ultimate form of despair and commits suicide by subjecting herself to a combination of the executions she inflicted on the other students.

She attempts to get the remaining students to graduate so that her personality can take over the real world bodies of those that died within the virtual world, but she is ultimately thwarted by Hajime Hinata and the other students, being destroyed when the virtual world is shut down.

However, with his investigative skills, he manages to help solve the murder mysteries, and even uncovers the truth behind Jabberwock Island being a simulated reality. He also discovers that he was originally part of the Reserve Course, a section of Hope's Peak Academy for students without Ultimate talents that was built to help save the school from its approaching bankruptcy through its exorbitant entry fees. Being heavily mocked and ridiculed for his lack of actual talent, combined with a bad incident involving Juzo Sakakura, led him to become a test subject in the Hope Cultivation Project. The experiment led to his memory and personality to be erased and replaced with one incorporating multiple Ultimate talents. Due to this combination of talents, Hajime's ability to empathize and take joy in the people around him was removed as well. Under his new persona Izuru Kamukura, the {{nihongo|Ultimate Hope|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e0c\u671b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Kib\u014d\"|Super High School Level Hope}}, he grew bored with the world due to being unable to relate to anyone and was manipulated by Junko into being present at the prototype killing game, the killing of Hope's Peak Academy's student council, where the event was blamed on him to incite the events that destroyed human civilization. Despite learning of his past and Izuru, Hajime manages to think for himself and help the others delete Alter Ego Junko. He is one of the survivors that manages to escape to the real world, deciding to live on as Hajime and look for a way to try to restore those who had died within the virtual world. He is briefly seen during the epilogue of ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' as Izuru, ripping out parts of Kurokuma and Shirokuma before he is sent to Jabberwock Island. At the end of ''Danganronpa 3: Despair Arc'', it is revealed that Izuru, having never actually been part of Ultimate Despair, had been freed of Junko's manipulations by Chiaki's death which, when combined with being blamed for the prototype killing game, caused Izuru to enact a revenge scheme that would see Junko utterly erased from existence, which succeeds when Hajime deletes Alter Ego Junko. In ''Danganronpa 3: Hope Arc'',  Hajime is revealed to have retained his own memories and the talents he gained as Izuru and used them to revive everyone who died in the virtual world, managing to stop Ryota from using his hope video before taking him with everyone towards a new future. He and his friends then broadcast a video claiming responsibility for the final killing game, freeing the Future Foundation of suspicion.\n\n;{{nihongo|Chiaki Nanami|\u4e03\u6d77 \u5343\u79cb|Nanami Chiaki}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|[[Christine Marie Cabanos]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/435879404586020864|title=Christine M.

She is a sleepy, laid-back student who is inexperienced in the ways of the world, but very skilled at video games. Along with Hajime, she becomes a central figure of the trials. She accidentally kills Nagito, falling into his trap which was meant to ensure her survival alone, but she thwarts his plans by confessing her identity and offering herself to be executed by getting crushed by a [[Tetris]] block in order to save the remaining students. It is learned during the graduation that she is actually an AI program designed to observe and protect the students during the Future Foundation's experiment. However, some of her consciousness remains, allowing her to help Hajime during his conflict. Her title is {{nihongo|Ultimate Gamer|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u30b2\u30fc\u30de\u30fc\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"G\u0113m\u0101\"|Super High School Level Gamer}}.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', it is revealed that the AI program was based on an actual student who attended Hope's Peak Academy along with the rest of the 77th class of Hope's Peak. Chiaki quickly befriended Hajime and was unanimously elected class representative after bringing video games to the class to help everyone bond. However, it was because of these traits that she was chosen to be executed by Junko in order to drive the rest of her class into becoming Remnants of Despair, forced to go through a dungeon filled with deadly traps before being skewered to death. It is her death that breaks Izuru free of Junko's control, causing the once-apathetic genius to begin planning his revenge.\n:Chiaki is the only student of Class 77-B who stays dead permanently, as she was physically killed by Junko, compared to the other victims who died within the simulation, fell into comas, and were subsequently revived by Hajime. The ending of ''Danganronpa 3'' shows Hajime finally bidding farewell to the AI version of Chiaki, as he embraces and chases his own future by joining Nagito and his other classmates.\n\n;{{nihongo|Nagito Komaeda|\u72db\u679d \u51ea\u6597|Komaeda Nagito}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Megumi Ogata]]|[[Bryce Papenbrook]]}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\" />\n:Nagito is a deliberate foil to the previous protagonist, Makoto. Like Makoto, Nagito is an optimistic, subservient student who was accepted to the academy by raffle and received the title of {{nihongo|Ultimate Lucky Student|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u5e78\u904b\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"K\u014dun\"|Super High School Level Good Luck}}. Unlike Makoto, his title is more literal, as he experiences an extraordinary cycle of good and bad luck that ultimately works to his benefit when good or causes some sort of harm to him when bad. Initially thought to be a friendly, upbeat, somewhat meek young man, he is shown to be quite deranged in his pursuit of hope, believing it to be an absolute good that only his talented classmates can achieve. Because of his beliefs, he is completely willing to let his talented classmates walk over him, for he sees himself as inferior to them, all while keeping his cheerful, optimistic attitude and frequently referring to himself as a \"stepping stone for [their] hope.\" He remains cheerful and enthusiastic even in horrifying situations when someone has died, which results in his classmates fearing him and finding him creepy. He is highly unstable and suicidal, as the bad luck of his cycle causes catastrophes in his life that he believes are unavoidable; this is compounded by the fact that he has a degenerative brain disease that is slowly eating away at his ability to think rationally and which will soon kill him. He also feels deep self-loathing over his talent being, in his mind, lackluster compared to his classmates' talents. Despite his self-loathing, Nagito does still see himself as being superior to normal people, and has an intense hatred for the Reserve Course, seeing them as talentless parasites leeching off the academy. After learning that he and the other students (with the exception of Chiaki) are the members of Ultimate Despair who were responsible for the destruction of the world, he becomes aggressive and confrontational towards the others. In order to rid the island of the Ultimate Despair students, he sets up a trap for the others by setting up a scenario to looks like he committed suicide, while actually tricking Chiaki into inadvertently killing him with poison, hoping the end result will lead to the execution of all Ultimate Despair students and rescue Nanami alone. However, Hajime realizes what truly happened and Nanami takes responsibility for his death, saving the other students.\n:In ''Danganronpa Another Episode'', Nagito appears under the title of Servant (\u53ec\u4f7f\u3044 ''Meshitsukai''), serving under the Warriors of Hope who had captured him. The Warriors of Hope frequently abused him, though he took it all with a smile. It is later revealed that he was manipulating the Warriors of Hope, in order to allow Komaru to grow and defeat despair through her power of hope. Even though ''Danganronpa Another Episode'' took place during the 77th class's time as Ultimate Despair, Nagito was unique in that he still longed for hope, whereas the others were fighting for despair alone.\n:In ''Danganronpa 3'', Nagito appears with the rest of his classmates after having awoken from their comas to rescue Makoto. During the time skip between Nagito's death in the program and his appearance in ''Danganronpa 3'', he has changed his worldview and is no longer obsessed with talent or hope. He is also once again friendly with his other classmates, especially Hajime, although his fanboy-like tendencies remain, as seen in his excitement over finally meeting Makoto in person.\n\n;{{nihongo|Fuyuhiko Kuzuryu|\u4e5d\u982d\u9f8d \u51ac\u5f66|Kuzury\u016b Fuyuhiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Daisuke Kishio]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (game), [[Aaron Dismuke]] (anime)}}<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\"danganronpa3dubcast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|title=Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope's Peak High School Broadcast Dub Cast Announcement|publisher=[[Funimation]].com|date=July 28, 2016|access-date=2016-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160730004611/http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/07/28/danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hopes-peak-high-school-broadcast-dub-cast-announcement/|archive-date=2016-07-30|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|title=Steve Prince - Alright you Danga Rompa fans: Danga Rompa 2... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224804/https://www.facebook.com/steve.prince.5437/posts/10152212832069921|archive-date=2016-02-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n:A wary student who is the successor of the largest [[yakuza]] family in Japan.

He does not get along with Kokichi, as Kokichi often teases Keebo due to his nature of not understanding jokes and sarcasm, and often ridicules his possibilities, which annoys Keebo to no end since he is a strong defender of robot rights and an opposer of robophobia. Throughout the game, he hears a voice in his head telling him what to do, and often listens to said voice. However, after his ahoge is destroyed in Chapter 5, he ponders the nature of hope and despair and notes the absence of the voice inside his head, subsequently going on a destructive rampage and leaving Shuichi and the remaining survivors with only until dawn to unearth the Mastermind of the killing game. Keebo is later revealed to be a creation of the Danganronpa reality show production team, with his past memories of Professor Iidabashi having all been lies. Keebo temporarily becomes the playable character in Chapter 6, before having his A.I. erased and replaced with the audience to vote on the fate of the killing game show at the end of the trial. Although he survives the final trial, he launches an attack on the school and self-destructs to destroy the dome surrounding the school and execute Tsumugi, effectively making him the final casualty of the game.\n\n;{{nihongo|Maki Harukawa|\u6625\u5ddd \u9b54\u59eb|Harukawa Maki}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Maaya Sakamoto]]}} (Japanese), [[Erica Mendez]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tsunderica/status/881269561995087872|title=Got the okay to say that I'm Maki Harukawa in Danganronpa V3!

It is revealed in Chapter 4 that she had been sold out by the orphanage and lived with a group of assassins, where she learned her skills in murder that earned her title. Throughout the game, she gradually becomes close with Shuichi and Kaito, the latter of whom she develops romantic feelings for, identifying him as the first person whom she has ever opened up to; like every other event in the game, however, this is revealed to be the result of the Danganronpa reality show's production team's machinations.

He quickly develops a brotherly bond with Shuichi and becomes interested in Maki in-game, going out of his way to protect them at all costs. Haunted by a chronic disease that is slowly killing him, he resolves to himself that he won't let himself die because of the killing game. Kaito murdered Kokichi at the latter's request in Chapter 5, and is sentenced to an execution in a similar fashion to that of Jin Kirigiri from the first game, but dies due to his chronic disease before he can be successfully executed. Prior to entering the killing game, Kaito appears to have had far less altruistic intentions, with him merely reiterating his desire for fame and fortune by killing on and winning the show in his interview.\n\n;{{nihongo|Himiko Yumeno|\u5922\u91ce \u79d8\u5bc6\u5b50|Yumeno Himiko}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Aimi Tanaka]]}} (Japanese), [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] (English)<ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":19\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ChristineMCVA/status/881317421377740801|title=I voice Himiko Yumeno in Danganronpa V3!

She was diagnosed with [[Anterograde amnesia|a psychological disorder that causes her constant loss of short and long term memories]], forgetting things shortly after she learns them. Hence, she writes everything down in a notebook she carries with her at all times. She is in love with her neurologist, Yasuke Matsuda, whom she visits frequently for check-ups. It is eventually revealed that in actuality, Ryoko is nothing but a fake identity of Junko, the product of her experimentation with various memory-erasing techniques in preparation for the first mutual killing game. Upon learning the truth, Ryoko falls into despair and kills Yasuke, subsequently reassuming her true identity of Junko to spread despair once more.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yasuke Matsuda|\u677e\u7530 \u591c\u52a9|Matsuda Yasuke}}\n:The {{nihongo|Ultimate Neurologist|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u795e\u7d4c\u5b66\u8005\u300d|Ch\u014d-k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Shinkei Gakusha\"}}, Ryoko's abrasive love interest and the one she visits for check-ups regarding her psychological state. Ironically, Yasuke is actually the cause of her current condition; he was roped into helping Junko test memory-wiping procedures prior to the events of the novels, and in doing so, removed all her memories and planted false ones in her notebook. He later catalyses Junko's reawakening, per her pre-experiment orders. He is killed in a fit of despair by Ryoko after she regains her memories and his body is mutilated post-mortem.\n\n;{{nihongo|Yuto Kamishiro|\u795e\u4ee3 \u512a\u514e|Kamishiro Y\u016bto}}\n:The {{nihongo|Ultimate Secret Agent|\u8d85\u9ad8\u6821\u7d1a\u306e\u300c\u8adc\u5831\u54e1\u300d|Ch\u014d k\u014dk\u014d-ky\u016b no \"Ch\u014dh\u014din\"}}.

He then traveled all over the world, hunting down serial killers as a sort of vigilante, until he returned to Japan one day and discovered that Takumi was also murdering killers in order to recreate the beauty he saw in Mukuro's massacre. Horrified, Shuji decided that he needed to \"save\" Takumi from himself by any means, even if that means wiping out all of humanity, due to them all being, in his eyes, potential serial killers.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Danganronpa}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Danganronpa}}\n[[Category:Danganronpa|List of Danganronpa characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters]]\n[[Category:Lists of video game characters]]\n", "name_user": "91.110.21.92", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Danganronpa_characters"}

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault captured [[Siege of Nicaea|captured ]] Nicea in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians. The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]].

However, the breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] gave rise to an entire class of warriors who now had little to do but fight among themselves.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=3\u20134}}.</ref> The random violence of the knightly class was regularly condemned by the church, and in response, it established the [[Peace and Truce of God]] to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, resulting in the [[Investiture Controversy]]. Popes such as [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of [[Christendom]], not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against [[Al-Andalus]], or, theoretically, against the [[Seljuq dynasty]] in the east.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|pp=5\u20138}}.</ref>\n\nTo the east of Europe lay the Byzantine Empire, composed of Christians who had long followed a separate [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] rite; the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches had been [[East\u2013West Schism|in schism]] since 1054.

The Seljuq Turks had taken over almost all of Anatolia after the Byzantine defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071; however, their conquests were piecemeal and led by semi-independent warlords, rather than by the sultan.

The Fatimids, under the nominal rule of [[caliph]] [[al-Musta'li]] but actually controlled by [[vizier]] [[al-Afdal Shahanshah]], had lost Jerusalem to the Seljuqs in 1073 (although some older accounts say 1076);<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|pp=410, 411 note 61}}.</ref> they recaptured it in 1098 from the [[Artuqids]], a smaller Turkish tribe associated with the Seljuqs, just before the arrival of the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Holt|1989|pp=11\u201314}}.</ref>\n\nFrom 1092 the status quo in the Middle East disintegrated following the death of the [[vizier]] and effective ruler of the Seljuk Empire, [[Nizam al-Mulk]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal.

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders. Finally, at the beginning of 1099, the march restarted, leaving Bohemond behind as the first Prince of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\n===Continued march to Jerusalem===\n{{main|First Crusade: March down the Mediterranean coast}}\n[[File:Byzantium after the First crusade.PNG|thumb|300px|Route of the First Crusade through Asia]]\n\nProceeding down the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coast, the crusaders encountered little resistance, as local rulers preferred to make peace with them and furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned [[siege of Arqa]].<ref name=\"Tyerman150\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=150}}.</ref>\n\n[[Iftikhar ad-Daula]], the Fatimid governor of Jerusalem, was aware of the arrival of the Crusaders.  He expelled all of Jerusalem's Christian inhabitants, to avoid the possibility of the city falling due to treason from the inside, and he poisoned most of the wells in the area and Christians were expelled from Jerusalem before the Crusaders' arrival.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=33}} The crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before, on 7 June.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege. Nevertheless, some historians propose that the scale of the massacre has been exaggerated in later medieval sources.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=34}}</ref>\n\nAfter the successful assault on the northern wall, the defenders fled to the [[Temple Mount]], pursued by Tancred and his men. Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

Outnumbered two to one the Franks launched a surprise dawn attack and routed the over confident and unprepared Muslim force. The opportunity was wasted though, as squabling between Raymond and Godfrey prevented an attempt by the city's garrison to surrender to the more trusted Raymond.

In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders,<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=443\u2013447}}.</ref> culminating in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recapture]] of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=616\u2013620}}.</ref>\n\nThe success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]].

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question.

A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan\nfurther argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n* [[Battle of Civetot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Baldwin |first=Marshall W. |title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |year=1969 |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne |isbn=978-0-299-04834-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bartlett |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Bartlett (historian) |title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950\u20131350 |publisher=Princeton |year=1994 |isbn=0-691-03780-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Chazan |first=Robert |title=In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |year=1997 |isbn=0-8276-0575-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/inyear1096firstc00chaz|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Hamilton |first1=Bernard |last2=France |first2=John |last3=Zajac |first3=William G. |title=The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton |publisher=Ashgate |year=1998 |isbn=0-86078-624-2|ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Housley |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Housley |title=Contesting the Crusades |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2006 |isbn=1-4051-1189-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.

of a number of [[religious war]]s initiated, supported and sometimes directed by the [[Latin Church]] in the [[medieval period]]. The initial objective was the recovery of the [[Holy Land]] from [[Muslim conquests|Islamic rule]]. These campaigns were subsequently given the name [[crusades]]. The first iniative for this crusade began in 1095 when the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]], [[Alexios I Komnenos]], requested military support from the [[Council of Piacenza]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s conflict with the Seljuk Turks. This was followed later in that year by the Council of Clermont where Pope Urban supported this request for military assistance and also urged for an armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem. This call was met with an enthusiastic popular response across all social classes in western Europe. Mobs of predominantly poor Christians numbering in the thousands led by a [[Peter the Hermit]], a French priest, responded first. What has become known as known as the [[People's Crusade]] passed through Germany and indulged in wide-ranging [[History of the Jews in Germany|anti-Jewish]] activities and [[Rhineland massacres|massacres]]. On leaving Byzantine-controlled territory in [[Byzantine Anatolia|Anatolia]] they were annihilated in a Turkish ambush at the [[Battle of Civetot]] in October 1096.\n\nIn what has become known as the '''Princes' Crusade''' members of the high nobility and their followers embarked in late summer 1096 and arrived at [[Constantinople]] between November and April the following year. This was a feudal host led by five princes: [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]]; the [[Italo-Normans]] [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] and his nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; the brothers [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] and [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin]] who led forces from [[Lotharingia]] and [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]]. The army was further augmented by northern French forces under [[Robert Curthose]]; Count [[Stephen, Count of Blois]]; and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders|Robert]]. In total and including non-combatants the army could possible be estimated as numbering 100,000. The crusaders marched into Anatolia. While the [[List of Seljuk sultans of R\u00fbm|Seljuk Sultan of R\u00fbm]], [[Kilij Arslan I|Kilij Arslan]], was away resolving a dispute a Frankish [[Siege of Nicaea|siege]] and Byzantine naval assault captured [[Siege of Nicaea|captured ]] Nicea in June 1097. In marching through Anatolia, the crusaders suffered starvation, thirst and disease before gaining experience of the Turkish lightly armoured mounted archers at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)|Battle of Dorylaeum]]. Baldwin left with a small force to establish the [[County of Edessa]], the first Crusader state and [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]] was captured in June 1098. Jerusalem was reached in June 1099 and the city was taken by [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|assault]] on 7 July 1099, massacring the defenders. A counter attack was repulsed at the [[Battle of Ascalon]]. After this the majority of the crusaders returned home.\n\nFour [[Crusader states]] were established in the [[Near East]]: the [[County of Edessa]], the [[Principality of Antioch]], the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]]. The crusader presence remained in the region in some form until the city of [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre fell]] in 1291 leading to the rapid loss of all remaining territory in the [[Levant]]. There were no further substantive attempts to recover the Holy Land after this.\n\n==Historical context==\n\nThe causes of the First Crusade, is [[#Historiographical debate|widely debated among historians]]. While the relative weight or importance of the various factors may be the subject of ongoing disputes, it is clear that the First Crusade came about from a combination of factors earlier in the 11th{{nbsp}}century in both Europe and the Near East. In Western Europe, Jerusalem was increasingly seen as worthy of penitential pilgrimages. The Seljuk hold on the Jerusalem was weak, and indeed they lost the city to the Fatimids, and returning pilgrims reported difficulties and the oppression of Christians. The Byzantine need for military support coincided with an increase in the willingness of the western European warrior class to accept papal military command.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=28}}{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=46}} Western Christians wanted a more effective Church and demonstrated an increased [[piety]]. From 1000 there was an increasing number of pilgrimages to the Holy Land using safer routes through Hungary. The knighthood and aristocracy developed new devotional and penitential practises that created a fertile ground for crusading recruitment.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|p=31}} \n\nThe motivation of the Crusaders' is unknown. There may have been a spiritual dimension seeking [[absolution]] through warfare. At one time historian [[Georges Duby]]'s theory that crusades offered economic and social opportunity for [[Primogeniture|younger, aristoctaic landless sons]] was popular amongst historians but this was challenged because it does not account for the wider kinship groups in Germany and Southern France. ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' talks about the opportunity for plunder and \"great booty\". Adventure was another explanation including the enjoyment of warfare. As was the fact that many crusaders had no choice as they obliged to follow their feudal lords.{{sfn|Jotischky|2004|pp=12\u201313,15\u201316}}\n\nChristianity had been adopted throughout the [[Roman Empire]] in [[Late Antiquity]], but in the 7th to 8th centuries, the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] had [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]], [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], and [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|North Africa]] from the predominantly Christian Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] from the [[Visigothic Kingdom]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=51\u201354}}.</ref> In North Africa, the Umayyad empire eventually collapsed and a number of smaller Muslim kingdoms emerged, such as the [[Aghlabids]], who attacked [[Italy]] in the [[Christianity in the 9th century|9th century]].

There were signs of considerable co-operation between [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in the years immediately before the crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=19\u201323}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1095, Urban turned to his homeland of France to recruit men for the expedition. His travels there culminated in the ten-day [[Council of Clermont]], where on Tuesday 27 November he gave an impassioned sermon to a large audience of French nobles and clergy. There are five versions of the speech recorded by people who may have been at the council ([[Baldric of Dol]], [[Guibert of Nogent]], [[Robert the Monk]], and [[Fulcher of Chartres]]) or who went on crusade (Fulcher and the anonymous author of the [[Gesta Francorum]]), as well as other versions found in later historians (such as [[William of Malmesbury]] and William of Tyre). All of these versions were written after Jerusalem had been captured. Thus it is difficult to know what was actually said and what was recreated in the aftermath of the successful crusade. The only contemporary records are a few letters written by Urban in 1095.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nThe five versions of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars, but all versions except that in the Gesta Francorum agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society and the necessity of maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=31\u201339}}</ref> They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal.

Urban had planned the departure of the first crusade for 15 August 1096, the [[Assumption of Mary|Feast of the Assumption]], but months before this, a number of unexpected armies of peasants and petty nobles set off for Jerusalem on their own, led by a charismatic priest called [[Peter the Hermit]]. Peter was the most successful of the preachers of Urban's message, and developed an almost hysterical enthusiasm among his followers, although he was probably not an \"official\" preacher sanctioned by Urban at Clermont.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=78\u201382}}.</ref> It is commonly believed that Peter's followers purely consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but there were also many knights among the peasants, including [[Walter Sans Avoir]], who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\">{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=28}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=82}}.</ref>\n\nLacking military discipline, in what likely seemed to the participants a strange land (Eastern Europe), Peter's fledgling army quickly found itself in trouble despite the fact they were still in Christian territory. The army led by Walter fought with the Hungarians over food at [[Belgrade]], but otherwise arrived in Constantinople unharmed. Meanwhile, the army led by Peter, which marched separately from Walter's army, also fought with the Hungarians, and may have captured Belgrade. At [[Ni\u0161|Nish]] the Byzantine governor tried to supply them, but Peter had little control over his followers and Byzantine troops were needed to quell their attacks. Peter arrived at Constantinople in August, where his army joined with the one led by Walter, which had already arrived, as well as separate bands of crusaders from France, Germany, and Italy. Another army of [[Bohemia]]ns and [[Saxony|Saxons]] did not make it past Hungary before splitting up.<ref name=\"Riley-Smith, p. 28\" />\n\nThis unruly mob began to attack and pillage outside the city in search of supplies and food, prompting Alexios to hurriedly ferry the gathering across the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] one week later.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=26\u201327}}.</ref> After crossing into Asia Minor, the crusaders split up and began to pillage the countryside, wandering into Seljuq territory around Nicaea. The greater experience of the Turks was overwhelming; and most of this group of the crusaders were massacred because of it. Some Italian and German crusaders were defeated and killed at Xerigordon at the end of August. Meanwhile, Walter and Peter's followers, who, although for the most part untrained in battle but led by about 50&nbsp;knights, fought a battle against the Turks [[Battle of Civetot|at Civetot]] in October. The Turkish archers destroyed the crusader army, and Walter was among the dead. Peter, who was absent in Constantinople at the time, later joined the main crusader army, along with the few survivors of Civetot.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=101\u2013103}}.</ref>\n\nAt a local level, the preaching of the First Crusade ignited the [[Rhineland massacres]] perpetrated against Jews, which some historians have deemed \"the first [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}}.</ref> At the end of 1095 and beginning of 1096, months before the departure of the official crusade in August, there were attacks on Jewish communities in France and Germany. In May 1096, [[Emicho|Emicho of Flonheim]] (sometimes incorrectly known as Emicho of Leiningen) attacked the Jews at Speyer and Worms. Other unofficial crusaders from Swabia, led by Hartmann of Dillingen, along with French, English, Lotharingian and Flemish volunteers, led by Drogo of Nesle and [[William the Carpenter]], as well as many locals, joined Emicho in the destruction of the Jewish community of Mainz at the end of May.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=84\u201385}}.</ref> In Mainz, one Jewish woman killed her children rather than see them killed; the chief rabbi, [[Kalonymus Ben Meshullam]], committed suicide in anticipation of being killed.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=102}}.</ref>\nEmicho's company then went on to Cologne, and others continued on to Trier, Metz, and other cities.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=103}}.</ref> Peter the Hermit may have been involved in violence against the Jews, and an army led by a priest named Folkmar also attacked Jews further east in Bohemia.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=24}}.</ref> Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of [[Coloman, King of Hungary|Coloman of Hungary]]. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.<ref name=\"Tyerman, p. 103\" />\nMany of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert, although they were also interested in acquiring money from them. Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy's official policy for crusading, and the Christian bishops, especially the Archbishop of Cologne, did their best to protect the Jews. A decade before, the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter. Nevertheless, some also took money in return for their protection. The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ, and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity. Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz, and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non-believers when there were already non-believers closer to home.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=103\u2013106}}.</ref> \n\n==Princes' Crusade==\n{{anchor|Princes' Crusade}}\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Routes of the leaders of the First Crusade]]\n\nThe four main crusader armies left Europe around the appointed time in August 1096. They took different paths to Constantinople and gathered outside its [[Walls of Constantinople|city walls]] between November 1096 and April 1097; Hugh of Vermandois arrived first, followed by Godfrey, Raymond, and Bohemond. This time, Emperor Alexios was more prepared for the crusaders; there were fewer incidents of violence along the way.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=103\u2013105}}.</ref> It is impossible to estimate the numbers involved. Some historians put a figure of 70,000 to 80,000 on the number who left Western Europe in the year after Clermont, and more joined in the three year duration.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|p=75}} Estimates for the number of Knights range from 7,000 to 10,000; 35,000 to 50,000 foot soldiers; and including non-combatants a total of 60,000 to 100,000.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}}\n\n===Recruitment===\n{{see|Christian Forces of the First Crusades|Army of Godfrey of Bouillon|Army of Hugh the Great|Army of Robert Curthose|Armies of Bohemond of Taranto}}\nUrban's speech had been well-planned: he had discussed the crusade with [[Adhemar of Le Puy]] and [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], and instantly the expedition had the support of two of southern France's most important leaders. Adhemar himself was present at the Council and was the first to \"take the cross\". During the rest of 1095 and into 1096, Urban spread the message throughout France, and urged his bishops and legates to preach in their own dioceses elsewhere in France, Germany, and Italy as well. However, it is clear that the response to the speech was much greater than even the Pope, let alone Alexios, expected. On his tour of France, Urban tried to forbid certain people (including women, monks, and the sick) from joining the crusade, but found this nearly impossible. In the end, most who took up the call were not knights, but peasants who were not wealthy and had little in the way of fighting skills, in an outpouring of a new emotional and personal piety that was not easily harnessed by the ecclesiastical and lay aristocracy.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> Typically, preaching would conclude with every volunteer taking a vow to complete a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; they were also given a cross, usually sewn onto their clothes.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=65\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAs Thomas Asbridge wrote, \"Just as we can do nothing more than estimate the number of thousands who responded to the crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=41}}.</ref> Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, \"This image is ... profoundly misleading.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=68}}.</ref> He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=69}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=15}}.</ref> It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=69\u201371}}.</ref>\n\nDespite this popular enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured that there would be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he recruited throughout 1096 included [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]], a southern Italian ally of the reform popes; Bohemond's nephew [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]]; [[Godfrey of Bouillon]], who had previously been an anti-reform ally of the Holy Roman Emperor; his brother [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]]; [[Hugh I, Count of Vermandois]], brother of the excommunicated [[Philip I of France]]; [[Robert Curthose]], brother of [[William II of England]]; and his relatives [[Stephen II, Count of Blois]] and [[Robert II, Count of Flanders]]. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=55\u201365}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusade was led by some of the most powerful nobles of France, who left everything behind, and it was often the case that entire families went on crusade at their own great expense.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|p=21}}.</ref> For example, Robert of Normandy loaned the [[Duchy of Normandy]] to his brother William II of England, and Godfrey sold or mortgaged his property to the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=77}}.</ref> According to Tancred's biographer, he was worried about the sinful nature of knightly warfare, and was excited to find a holy outlet for violence.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=71}}.</ref> Tancred and Bohemond, as well as Godfrey, Baldwin, and their older brother [[Eustace III, Count of Boulogne]], are examples of families who crusaded together. Riley-Smith argues that the enthusiasm for the crusade was perhaps based on family relations, as most of the French crusaders were distant relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1998|pp=93\u201397}}.</ref> Nevertheless, in at least some cases, personal advancement played a role in Crusaders' motives. For instance, Bohemond was motivated by the desire to carve himself out a territory in the east, and had previously campaigned against the Byzantines to try to achieve this. The Crusade gave him a further opportunity, which he took after the [[Siege of Antioch]], taking possession of the city and establishing the Principality of Antioch.<ref name=\"Neveux186\">{{harvnb|Neveux|2008|pp=186\u2013188}}.</ref>\n\nThe size of the entire crusader army is difficult to estimate; various numbers were given by the eyewitnesses, and equally various estimates have been offered by modern historians. Crusader military historian [[David Nicolle]] considers the armies to have consisted of about 30,000\u201335,000 crusaders, including 5,000 [[cavalry]]. Raymond had the largest contingent of about 8,500 [[infantry]] and 1,200 cavalry.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2003|pp=21, 32}}.</ref>\n\nThe princes arrived in Constantinople with little food and expected provisions and help from Alexios. Alexios was understandably suspicious after his experiences with the People's Crusade, and also because the knights included his old Norman enemy, Bohemond, who had invaded Byzantine territory on numerous occasions with his father, [[Robert Guiscard]], and may have even attempted to organize an attack on Constantinople while encamped outside the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=106}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders may have expected Alexios to become their leader, but he had no interest in joining them, and was mainly concerned with transporting them into Asia Minor as quickly as possible.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=110}}.</ref> In return for food and supplies, Alexios requested the leaders to swear [[fealty]] to him and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land recovered from the Turks. Godfrey was the first to take the oath, and almost all the other leaders followed him, although they did so only after warfare had almost broken out in the city between the citizens and the crusaders, who were eager to pillage for supplies. Raymond alone avoided swearing the oath, instead pledging that he would simply cause no harm to the Empire. Before ensuring that the various armies were shuttled across the Bosporus, Alexios advised the leaders on how best to deal with the Seljuq armies that they would soon encounter.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=110\u2013113}}.</ref>\n\n===Siege of Nicaea===\n{{Main|Siege of Nicaea}}\n\nThe Crusader armies crossed over into Asia Minor during the first half of 1097, where they were joined by Peter the Hermit and the remainder of his relatively small army. In addition, Alexios also sent two of his own generals, [[Manuel Boutoumites]] and [[Tatikios]], to assist the crusaders. The first objective of their campaign was [[Nicaea]], previously a city under Byzantine rule, but which had become the capital of the Seljuq [[Sultanate of Rum]] under [[Kilij Arslan I]]. Arslan was away campaigning against the [[Danishmends]] in central Anatolia at the time, and had left behind his treasury and his family, underestimating the strength of these new crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=117\u2013120}}.</ref>\n\nSubsequently, upon the Crusaders' arrival, the city was subjected to a lengthy siege, and when Arslan had word of it he rushed back to Nicaea and attacked the crusader army on 16 May. He was driven back by the unexpectedly large crusader force, with heavy losses being suffered on both sides in the ensuing battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=124\u2013126}}.</ref> The siege continued, but the crusaders had little success as they found they could not blockade [[Lake \u0130znik|the lake]], which the city was situated on, and from which it could be provisioned.  To break the city, Alexios sent the Crusaders' ships rolled over land on logs, and at the sight of them the Turkish garrison finally surrendered on 18 June.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=126\u2013130}}.</ref> \n\nThere was some discontent amongst the Franks who were forbidden from looting the city. This was ameliorated by Alexius financially rewarding the crusaders. Later chronicles exagerate tension between the Greeks and Franks but Stephen of Blois, in a letter to his wife [[Adela of Normandy|Adela of Blois]]  confirms goodwill and cooperation continued at this point.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=55}} As Thomas Asbridge writes, \"the fall of Nicaea was a product of the successful policy of close co-operation between the crusaders and Byzantium.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=130}}.</ref> \n\n===Battle of Dorylaeum===\n{{Main|Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)}}\n\n[[File:Baldwin of Boulogne entering Edessa in Feb 1098.JPG|thumb|230px|right|[[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin of Boulogne]] entering [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] in 1098 ([[history painting]], [[Joseph-Nicolas Robert-Fleury]] 1840)]]\n\nAt the end of June, the crusaders marched on through Anatolia. They were accompanied by some Byzantine troops under Tatikios, and still harboured the hope that Alexios would send a full Byzantine army after them. They also divided the army into two more-easily managed groups\u2014one contingent led by the Normans, the other by the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=132\u201334}}.</ref> The two groups intended to meet again at [[Dorylaeum]], but on 1 July the Normans, who had marched ahead of the French, were attacked by Kilij Arslan. Arslan had gathered a much larger army than he previously had after his defeat at Nicaea, and now surrounded the Normans with his fast-moving mounted archers. The Normans \"deployed in a tight-knit defensive formation\",<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=135}}.</ref> surrounding all their equipment and the non-combatants who had followed them along the journey, and sent for help from the other group. When the French arrived, Godfrey broke through the Turkish lines and the legate Adhemar outflanked the Turks from the rear; thus the Turks, who had expected to destroy the Normans and did not anticipate the quick arrival of the French, fled rather than face the combined crusader army.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=135\u201337}}.</ref>\n\nThe crusaders' march through Anatolia was thereafter unopposed, but the journey was unpleasant, as Arslan had burned and destroyed everything he left behind in his army's flight. It was the middle of summer, and the crusaders had very little food and water; many men and horses died.<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|pp=138\u201339}}.</ref> Fellow Christians sometimes gave them gifts of food and money, but more often than not, the crusaders simply looted and pillaged whenever the opportunity presented itself. Individual leaders continued to dispute the overall leadership, although none of them were powerful enough to take command on their own, as Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader. After passing through the [[Cilician Gates]], Baldwin of Boulogne set off on his own towards the Armenian lands around the [[Euphrates]]; his wife, his only claim to European lands and wealth, had died after the battle, giving Baldwin no incentive to return to Europe. Thus, he resolved to seize a fiefdom for himself in the Holy Land. Early in 1098, he was adopted as heir by [[Thoros of Edessa]], a ruler who was disliked by his Armenian subjects for his [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] religion. Thoros was later killed, during an uprising that Baldwin may have instigated.<ref name=\"Hindley37\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=37}}.</ref> Then, in March 1098, Baldwin became the new ruler, thus creating the [[County of Edessa]], the first of the crusader states.<ref name=\"Hindley37\" />\n\n===Siege of Antioch===\n{{Main|Siege of Antioch|Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan}}\n{{See also|Tafurs}}\n\n[[File:Gustave dore crusades bohemond alone mounts the rampart of antioch.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond of Taranto]] Alone Mounts the Rampart of [[Antioch]]'' by [[Gustave Dor\u00e9]] (1871)|alt=Bohemond of Taranto is illuminated in the engraving as he is shown being the only one climbing the rampart of Antioch.

Described by Stephen of Blois as \"a city great beyond belief, very strong and unassailable\", the idea of taking the city by assault was a discouraging one to the crusaders.<ref name=\"Hindley28\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=38}}.</ref> Hoping rather to force a capitulation, or find a traitor inside the city\u2014a tactic that had previously seen Antioch change to the control of the Byzantines and then the Seljuq Turks\u2014the crusader army set Antioch to siege on 20 October 1097.<ref name=\"Hindley39\">{{harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=39}}</ref> Antioch was so large that the crusaders did not have enough troops to fully surround it, and as a result it was able to stay partially supplied.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=135}}.</ref> \n\nBy January the attritional eight month siege led to hundreds, or possibly thousands, of crusaders dieing of starvation. Adhemar considered this was caused by their sinful nature; woman were expelled from the camp, fasting, prayer, almsgiving and procession undertaken. Many, such as Stephen of Blois,  deserted. Foraging systems eased the situation, as did supplies from Cicilia, Edessa, through the recently captured ports of [[Latakia]] and [[Port Saint Symeon]] and in March  a small English fleet.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=68\u201369}} The Franks benefited from disunity in the Muslim world and the possible misunderstanding that they were thought to be Byzantine merceneries. The Seljuk brothers,[[Duqaq]] of Syria and [[Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan]] of Aleppo dispatched separate relief armies in December and Febuary that if they had been combined would probably have been victorious.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=71}} In response to these failures the [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]] raised a coalition from southern Syria, nothern Iraq and Anatolia with the ambition of extending his power from Syria to the Mediterranean sea. Bohemond persuaded that other leaders that in Antioch fell he would keep it for himself and that an Armenian commander of a section of the cities walls had agreed to enable the crusaders to enter. Stephen of Blois had been his only competitor and while deserting his message to Alexius that the cause was lost persuaded the Emperor to halt his advance through Anatolia at [[Philomelium]] before returning to Constantinople. Alexius failure to reach the seige was used by Bohemond to rationalise his refusal to return the city to the Empire as promised.{{sfn|Tyerman|2019|pp=87\u201388}} The Armenian, [[Firouz]], helped Bohemond and a small party enter the city on the 2nd June and open a gate at which point horns were sounded, the city's Christian majority opened the other gates and the crusaders entered. In the sack they killed most of the Muslim inhabitants and many Christian Greeks, Syrians and Armenians in the confusion.\n\nOn 4 June the vanguard of Kerbogha's 40,000 strong army arrived surrounding the Franks. From the 10 Junes for 4 days waves of Kerbogha's men assailed the city walls from dawn until dusk. Bohemond and Adhemar barred the city gates to prevent mass desertions and managed to hold out. Kerbogha then changed tactics to trying to starve the crusaders out. Morale inside the city was low and defeat looked imminent but a peasant visionary called [[Peter Bartholomew]] claimed the apostle [[St Andrew]] came to him to show the location of the [[Holy Lance]] that had pierced Christ on the cross. This supposedly encouraged the crusaders but the accounts are misleading as it was two weeks before the final battle for the city. On the 24 June the Franks sought terms for surrender that were refused. On 28 June 1098 at dawn the Franks marched out of the city in four battle groups to engage the enemy. Kerbogha allowed them to deploy with the aim of destroying them in the open. However the discipline of the Muslim army did not hold and a disorderly attack was launched. Unable to overrun a bedraggled force they outnumbered two to one Muslims attacking the Bridge Gate fled through the advancing main body of the Muslim army. With very few casualities the Muslim army broke and fled the battle.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|pp=74\u201382}} \n\nStephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in [[Alexandretta]] when he learned of the situation in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army on his way back to France.{{sfn|Madden|2005|p=28}} Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the [[Franks]] of northern France, the [[Provence|Proven\u00e7als]] of southern France, and the [[Normans]] of southern Italy considered themselves separate \"nations\", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might just be as easily blamed.<ref name=\"Neveux186\" />\n\nMeanwhile, a plague broke out, killing many among the army, including the legate Adhemar, who died on 1 August.<ref name=\"Lock23\">{{harvnb|Lock|2006|p=23}}.</ref> There were now even fewer horses than before, and worse, the Muslim peasants in the area refused to supply the crusaders with food. Thus, in December, after the Arab town of [[Ma'arrat al-Numan]] was captured following [[Siege of Ma'arrat al-Numan|a siege]], history describes the first occurrence of [[cannibalism]] among the crusaders.<ref>{{harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=261}}.</ref> Radulph of Caen wrote, \"In Ma'arrat our troops boiled pagan adults in cooking pots; they impaled children on spits and devoured them grilled.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Hotaling|2003|p=114}}</ref> At the same time, the minor knights and soldiers had become increasingly restless and threatened to continue to Jerusalem without their squabbling leaders.

Here there was no prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as they had at Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> They might have been left with little choice, as by the time the Crusader army reached Jerusalem, it has been estimated that only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained.<ref name=\"crusadearmy\">{{harvnb|Konstam|2004|p=133}}.</ref> These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Proven\u00e7al contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nAfter the failure of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was organized in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under [[Guglielmo Embriaco]] arrived at [[Jaffa]], and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build [[siege engine]]s.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of [[Joshua]] at the siege of [[Tell es-Sultan|Jericho]].<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" /> After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount of Olives where Peter the Hermit preached to them,<ref>Runciman284</ref> and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.<ref name=\"Tyerman153\" />\n\nThe final assault on Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops attacked the south gate while the other contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Proven\u00e7als at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched at both ends of the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\">{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=157\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1099 Siege of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|Siege of Jerusalem]] as depicted in a medieval manuscript]]\nThe massacre that followed the capture of Jerusalem has attained particular notoriety, as a \"juxtaposition of extreme violence and anguished faith\".<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|p=159}}.</ref> The eyewitness accounts from the crusaders themselves leave little doubt that there was great slaughter in the aftermath of the siege.

Arriving before the defenders could secure the area, Tancred's men assaulted the precinct, butchering many of the defenders, with the remainder taking refuge in the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]. Tancred then called a halt to the slaughter, offering those in the mosque his protection.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> When the defenders on the southern wall heard of the fall of the northern wall, they fled to the citadel, allowing Raymond and the Proven\u00e7als to enter the city. [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]], the commander of the garrison, struck a deal with Raymond, surrendering the citadel in return for being granted safe passage to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]].<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\nThe slaughter continued for the rest of the day; Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue died when it was burnt down by the Crusaders. The following day, Tancred's prisoners in the mosque were slaughtered. Nevertheless, it is clear that some Muslims and Jews of the city survived the massacre, either escaping or being taken prisoner to be ransomed.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" /> The Eastern Christian population of the city had been expelled before the siege by the governor, and thus escaped the massacre.<ref name=\"Tyerman157*\" />\n\n===Establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem===\n[[File:Crusader Graffiti in the Church of the holy supulchure Jerusalem Victor 2011 -1-21.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crusader graffiti in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nOn 22 July, a council was held in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] to establish governance for Jerusalem. The death of the Greek Patriach meant there was no obvious candidate to establish an ecclesiastical realm the clergy contended. Raymond of Toulouse's support had waned since Arqa so Godfrey accepted the title [[Defender of the Holy Sepulchre]] and took secular power. Raymond was incensed at this development, attempted to seize the [[Tower of David]] before leaving the city.{{sfn|Asbridge|2012|p=42}} The exact nature and meaning of Godfrey's title is somewhat controversial. Although it is widely claimed that he took the title ''Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri'' (\"advocate\" or \"defender\" of the Holy Sepulchre), this title is only used in a letter that was not written by Godfrey. Instead, Godfrey himself seems to have used the more ambiguous term ''princeps'', or simply retained his title of ''dux'' from Lower Lorraine. According to William of Tyre, writing in the later 12th century when Godfrey was already a legendary hero in crusader Jerusalem, he refused to wear \"a crown of gold\" where Christ had worn \"a crown of thorns\".<ref>William of Tyre, [http://thelatinlibrary.com/williamtyre/9.html#9 Book 9, Chapter 9].</ref> [[Robert the Monk]] is the only contemporary chronicler of the crusade to report that Godfrey took the title \"king\".<ref>Riley-Smith (1979), \"The Title of Godfrey of Bouillon\", ''Bulletin of the Institute of Historical Research'' '''52''', pp. 83\u201386.</ref><ref>Murray, Alan V.

In the wake of the death of Malik Shah I in 1092, political instability and the division of the [[Great Seljuq Empire]] prevented a coherent defence against the Latin states. Cooperation between them remained difficult for many decades, but from Egypt to Syria to Baghdad there were calls for the expulsion of the crusaders,<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=443\u2013447}}.</ref> culminating in the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recapture]] of Jerusalem under [[Saladin]] later in the century when the [[Ayyubid]]s had united the surrounding areas.<ref>{{harvnb|Baldwin|1969|pp=616\u2013620}}.</ref>\n\nThe success of the crusade inspired the literary imagination of poets in France, who, in the 12th century, began to compose various ''[[chansons de geste]]'' celebrating the exploits of Godfrey of Bouillon and other crusaders. Some of these, such as the [[Chanson d'Antioche]], are semi-historical, while others are completely fanciful, describing battles with a dragon or connecting Godfrey's ancestors to the legend of the [[Knight of the Swan]].

Following the [[Battle of Manzikert|defeat]] at [[Malazgirt|Manzikert]] in 1071, Muslims had taken half of the Byzantine Empire's territory, and such strategically and religiously important cities as Antioch and Nicaea had only fallen to Muslims in the decade before the [[Council of Piacenza]].<ref name=\"treadgold\" /> Moreover, the harrowing accounts of the atrocities committed by the invaders against the Anatolian population recorded by Eastern Christian chroniclers such as [[John Skylitzes]], [[Michael Attaleiates]], [[Matthew of Edessa]], Michael the Syrian and others (summarized Vryonis 1971) align with the primary motivation of relieving the acute distress suffered by the Byzantine empire.\nIn addition, the early 11th century saw a worsening of Muslim-Christian relations in the Levant; for example, in 1009 the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been [[Destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre 1009|destroyed]] by the Fatimid Caliph [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]]; [[Pope Sergius IV]] had supposedly already called for a military expedition in response to this.<ref>\nThe bull attributed to Sergius was considered genuine by Erdmann (1935), but its authenticity was later called into question.

A theory proposed by [[Carl Erdmann]] (1935), known as the \"Erdmann thesis\", links the First Crusade l to the [[Gregorian Reform]], the series of reforms initiated by [[Pope Gregory VII]] during c. 1050\u201380. These reforms re-established the [[Western Christianity|Western Church]], which had been [[Saeculum obscurum|much weakened]] during the 10th century, as a relevant power able to inspire and co-ordinate the crusades.<ref>Erdmann (1935), ''Die Entstehung des Kreuzzugsgedankens''. Translated into English as ''The Origin of the Idea of Crusade'' by Marshall W. Baldwin and Walter Goffart in 1977.</ref> \nThe \"Erdmann thesis\" proposes that the strengthened Western Church, combined with the weakened Byzantine Empire, permitted a projection of power from west to east, with the actual conquest of Jerusalem figuring at best as a secondary, popular goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|1991|p=1}}.</ref>\n\nWhile it is clear that the motivations for and causes of the First Crusade are to be sought both in the East and in the West, there has still been much debate among historiographers of the later 20th century on how the relative impact of such causes should be weighed.\n\n[[Steven Runciman]]'s literary three-volume work ''[[A History of the Crusades]]'', published between 1951 and 1954, significantly shaped the popular perception of the crusades in the later 20th century. However, academic crusade historians now consider it dated, polemical, derivative, tendentious and misleading. Stylisticly it owes much in style to Gibbons, Greek specialist [[George Finlay]] and his [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] tutor [[J. B. Bury]]. Runciman used literary devices and even invented events. His coverage of the First Crusade is largely based on {{lang|fr|Histoire de la Premi\u00e8re Croisade jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9lection de Godefroi de Bouillon}} by [[Ferdinand Chalandon]]. Runciman viewed the crusade as a \"[[clash of civilisations]]\" using broad stereotypes: western Europeans were ignorant, rough and rude; Byzantine Greeks were cultivated, sophisticated and decadent; Muslims had tolerance, faith and martial vigour. [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] quotes Runciman as saying \"''[he] was not an historian, but a writer of literature''\".{{sfn|Tyerman|2011|pp=192\u2013199}}\n\nIn a similar vein, [[Thomas Asbridge]] (2004) argues that the First Crusade was a strategic attempt to expand the power of the Western Church, and reunite the churches of Rome and Constantinople, which had been in [[East\u2013West Schism|schism since 1054]]. According to this view, the Islamic conquests were of little importance in this, as \"Islam and Christendom had coexisted for centuries in relative equanimity\".<ref>{{harvnb|Asbridge|2004|p=17}}; for Urban's personal motives, see pp.&nbsp;19\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, historians of the second half of the 20th century, such as [[Speros Vryonis]] (1971), have emphasized the importance of the military threat of Islamic expansion and the atrocities and attacks against Christians in Anatolia and the Levant.<ref name=\"Vryonis\">{{harvnb|Vryonis|1971|pp=85\u2013117}}.</ref>\nSimilarly, [[Moshe Gil]] (1997) argues against Runciman on the basis of contemporary Jewish [[Cairo Geniza]] documents, as well as later Muslim accounts, concluding that the Seljuq invasion of Anatolia and the occupation of Palestine (c.&nbsp;1073\u20131098) was a period of \"slaughter and vandalism, of economic hardship, and the uprooting of populations\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gil|1997|p=420}}; for details on the Seljuq occupation of Palestine, see pp.&nbsp;410\u2013420.</ref> Indeed, drawing upon earlier writers such as Ignatius of Melitene, [[Michael the Syrian]] had recorded that the Seljuqs subjected Coele-Syria and the Palestinian coast to \"cruel destruction and pillage\".<ref>''Chronique de Michel le Syrien'', pp.&nbsp;170\u2013171.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas F. Madden]] represents a view almost diametrically opposed to that of Asbridge; while the crusade was certainly linked to church reform and attempts to assert papal authority, he argues that it was most importantly a pious struggle to liberate fellow Christians, who, Madden claims, \"had suffered mightily at the hands of the Turks\". This argument distinguishes the relatively recent violence and warfare that followed the conquests of the Turks from the general advance of Islam in the early medieval period, the significance of which had been dismissed by Runciman and Asbridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Madden|2005|p=7}}.</ref>\n \n[[Christopher Tyerman]] (2006) attempted a resolution by arguing for compound causes, presenting the First Crusade as developing out of the Western church reform and theories of holy war as much as being a response to conflicts with the Islamic world throughout Europe and the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|2006|pp=56\u201357}}.</ref>\n\nIn the view of [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] (2005), additional contingencies such as poor harvests, overpopulation, and a pre-existing movement towards colonizing the frontier areas of Europe have also contributed to the crusade; however, he also takes care to say that \"most commentators then and a minority of historians now have maintained that the chief motivation was a genuine idealism\".<ref>{{harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|p=17}}.</ref>\n\n[[Peter Frankopan]] (2012) has argued that the First Crusade has been fundamentally distorted by the attention paid by historians to western (Latin) sources, rather than Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Arabic and Hebrew material from the late 11th and 12th centuries. The expedition to Jerusalem, he argues, was conceived of not by the Pope but by the Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], in response to a dramatic deterioration of Byzantium's position in Asia Minor and also as a result of a state of near anarchy at the imperial court where plans to depose Alexios or even murder him were an open secret by 1094. \nThe appeal to Pope [[Urban II]] was a desperate move to shore up Emperor and Empire. Frankopan\nfurther argues that the primary military targets of the First Crusade in Asia Minor \u2014 [[Nicaea]] and [[Antioch]] \u2014 required large numbers of soldiers with experience in siege warfare, precisely the type of force recruited by Urban in France in his call to arms of 1095/6.<ref>{{harvnb|Frankopan|2012|pp=87\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Commons category|First Crusade}}\n\n* [[Christian Forces of the First Crusades]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Godfrey of Bouillon]]\n** [[The Crusader Army of Hugh the Great]]\n** [[Army of Robert Curthose on the First Crusade|The Crusader Army of Robert Curthose]]\n* [[Second Crusade]]\n* [[Battle of Civetot]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Asbridge |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Asbridge |title=The First Crusade: A New History |publisher=Oxford |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-517823-8 |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/firstcrusadenewh00asbr }}\n* {{cite book|last=Asbridge|first=Thomas|authorlink=Thomas Asbridge|title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land|year=2012|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|isbn=978-1-84983-688-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Baldwin |first=Marshall W. |title=A History of the Crusades: The First Hundred Years |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wisconsin |year=1969 |url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/History.CrusOne |isbn=978-0-299-04834-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bartlett |first=Robert |author-link=Robert Bartlett (historian) |title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950\u20131350 |publisher=Princeton |year=1994 |isbn=0-691-03780-9|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Chazan |first=Robert |title=In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |year=1997 |isbn=0-8276-0575-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/inyear1096firstc00chaz|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Frankopan |first=Peter |title=The First Crusade: The Call from the East |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2012 | isbn=978-0-674-05994-8 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Gil |first=Moshe |authorlink=Moshe Gil |title=A History of Palestine, 634\u20131099 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-59984-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last1=Hamilton |first1=Bernard |last2=France |first2=John |last3=Zajac |first3=William G. |title=The Crusades and their Sources: Essays Presented to Bernard Hamilton |publisher=Ashgate |year=1998 |isbn=0-86078-624-2|ref=harv}}\n* Harris, Jonathan (2014), ''Byzantium and the Crusades'', Bloomsbury, 2nd ed. {{ISBN|978-1-78093-767-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Hillenbrand |first=Carole |authorlink=Carole Hillenbrand |title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=0-415-92914-8|ref=harv}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hindley |first=Geoffrey |title=A Brief History of the Crusades: Islam and Christianity in the Struggle for World Supremacy |year=2004 |publisher=Constable & Robinson |location=London |isbn=978-1-84119-766-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 300] |ref=harv |url=https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofcr0000hind/page/300 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=Holt |first=Peter M. |title=The Age of the Crusades: The Near East from the Eleventh Century to 1517 |publisher=Longman |year=1989 |isbn=0-582-49302-1 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hotaling |first=Edward |title=Islam Without Illusions: Its Past, Its Present, and Its Challenge for the Future |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8156-0766-3 |url=https://archive.org/details/islamwithoutillu0000hota|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Housley |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Housley |title=Contesting the Crusades |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Malden, MA |year=2006 |isbn=1-4051-1189-5|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Jotischky|first=Andrew|title=Crusading and the Crusader States|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-582-41851-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rTUlDwAAQBAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Konstam |first=Angus |author-link=Angus Konstam |title=Historical Atlas of the Crusades |publisher=Mercury Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-904668-00-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Lock |first=Peter |title=Routledge Companion to the Crusades |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=0-415-39312-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Madden |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas F.
