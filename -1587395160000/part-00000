In addition to [[policy studies]] and [[policy analysis]], the school requires its students to pursue training in [[economics]] and [[statistics]] through preliminary examinations and course requirements.

The Center on Public Policy, established in 1966, was a research center and so did not offer degrees. The Center hosted fellows and conferences and published research in the field of public policy, primarily urban studies and urban journalism.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = What's Wrong With Women's Pages?\n | contribution = The Urban Journalism Fellowship Program\n | series = University of Chicago Center for Policy Studies\n | publisher = Chicago, Illinois\n | date = 1971\n | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_wrong_with_women_s_pages.html?id=OvHyAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Committee on Public Policy was formed to offer master's degrees to students interested in policy studies. The Committee, formed of professors employed by different academic divisions, began offering classes in 1976 to a small group of one-year Master's students who had applied internally from other graduate divisions within the University of Chicago. The Committee's long term viability was called into question for reasons including the small demand for one year master's degrees in public policy and weak administrative support for such a small program.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Look Back at the Committee on Public Policy Studies |url=https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/look-back-committee-public-policy-studies|publisher= Harris School of Public Policy|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Over the next three years the Committee began offering two year degrees, joint BA/MA degrees and PhDs, but it continued to be threatened by weak administrative support and unstable funding.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = The Irving B.

In addition to [[policy studies]] and [[policy analysis]], the school requires its students to pursue training in [[economics]] and [[statistics]] through preliminary examinations and course requirements. Further, Harris Public Policy takes part in curricular interactions with the University-at-large, with students cross-enrolling in courses at the [[University of Chicago Graduate School of Business|Booth School of Business]], [[University of Chicago Law School|Law School]], [[University of Chicago School of Social Service Administration|School of Social Service Administration]], and the Graduate Division of the Social Sciences. The school's namesake is businessman [[Irving B. Harris]], who made a donation that established the Harris School in 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Who was Irving B.

A former residence hall designed by architect [[Edward Durell Stone]] was renovated and renamed The Keller Center, housing the Harris School of Public Policy as of 2019. The Keller Center's Forum provides a venue for speakers and open work space. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Keller Center At Harris Public Policy|url=http://www.thekellercenter.com/project-updates/|publisher=Harris School of Public Policy|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Harris School of Public Policy was predated by the Committee on Public Policy and The University of Chicago Center for Policy Study. The Center on Public Policy, established in 1966, was a research center and so did not offer degrees. The Center hosted fellows and conferences and published research in the field of public policy, primarily urban studies and urban journalism.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = What's Wrong With Women's Pages?\n | contribution = The Urban Journalism Fellowship Program\n | series = University of Chicago Center for Policy Studies\n | publisher = Chicago, Illinois\n | date = 1971\n | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_wrong_with_women_s_pages.html?id=OvHyAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Committee on Public Policy was formed to offer master's degrees to students interested in policy studies. The Committee, formed of professors employed by different academic divisions, began offering classes in 1976 to a small group of one-year Master's students who had applied internally from other graduate divisions within the University of Chicago. The Committee's long term viability was called into question for reasons including the small demand for one year master's degrees in public policy and weak administrative support for such a small program.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Look Back at the Committee on Public Policy Studies |url=https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/look-back-committee-public-policy-studies|publisher= Harris School of Public Policy|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Over the next three years the Committee began offering two year degrees, joint BA/MA degrees and PhDs, but it continued to be threatened by weak administrative support and unstable funding.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = The Irving B.

Harry, Vada's father, is a widowed funeral director who does not understand Vada, so he constantly ignores her. Their house, which operates as the town [[funeral home]], has led Vada to develop an obsession with death. Vada regularly cares for her paternal grandmother, 'Gramoo', who has [[Alzheimer's disease]] and whose wandering mind likewise affects Vada. Vada's uncle, Phil lives nearby and frequently stops by to help the family. Vada is a [[hypochondriasis|hypochondriac]] and spends time with her best friend, Thomas J. Sennett, an unpopular boy her age who suffers from various [[allergy|allergies]]. However, other girls tease the two about being more than just friends. Thomas J. often accompanies Vada when she visits the doctor, who assures her that she is not sick. Vada befriends Shelly DeVoto, the new makeup artist at Harry's funeral parlor, who provides her with guidance. Vada also develops a crush on her fifth-grade school teacher, Mr. Bixler, and hears about an adult poetry writing class that he is teaching. Vada steals some money from the cookie jar in Shelly's trailer to cover the cost of the class. When advised to write about what is in her soul, it emerges that Vada fears that she killed her mother, who died two days after giving birth to her. \n\nWhen Harry and Shelly start dating, this affects Vada's attitude towards Shelly. One night, Vada follows the pair to a bingo game and brings Thomas J. along to disrupt it. On the Fourth of July, when Shelly's ex-husband Danny arrives, Vada hopes that he is there to take Shelly back and becomes even more distressed when Harry and Shelly announce their [[engagement]] at a carnival, leading her to contemplate running away with Thomas J. Vada is starting to see changes within herself. She runs around screaming that she is hemorrhaging until Shelly explains to her that her [[Menarche|first period]] is a completely natural process. As Vada realizes this only occurs with girls, she doesn't want to see Thomas J., who happens to come by shortly afterward. A couple of days later, Vada and Thomas J. are sitting under a tree by a river, where they share an innocent first kiss. Vada and Thomas J. come across a bees' nest hanging from a tree, which Thomas J. decides to knock down. Vada loses her [[mood ring]] in the process, so they start looking for it, but the search is cut short as the bees start swarming, making them run away. Thomas J. later returns to find Vada\u2019s mood ring, but gets stung and dies from an [[Anaphylaxis|allergic reaction]].\n\nHarry is left to deliver the news to Vada, which upsets her so much that she will not even leave her bedroom. When she does attend Thomas J.'s funeral, she has to run away, but on hurrying to Mr. Bixler's house she discovers that he is about to get married. She then runs to her and Thomas J.'s favorite spot to reflect on what has happened. When Vada returns home, everyone is relieved, including Shelly, whom Vada begins to accept as her future [[stepmother]]. Vada's grief also manages to mend the rift between her and Harry, who explains to Vada that her mother's death wasn't her fault and things like that can happen without explanation. Later, Vada and Harry see Thomas J.\u2019s Mother, who still struggles with Thomas J.'s death and gives Vada her mood ring, which Thomas J. had found while Vada comforts Thomas J.\u2019s Mother. On the last day of her writing class, Vada reads out a poem that she wrote about the death of Thomas J. and then goes outside to ride bikes with her new best friend, Judy.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Dan Aykroyd]] as Harry Sultenfuss\n*[[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Shelly DeVoto\n*[[Macaulay Culkin]] as Thomas J.

[[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] had them erected between 1291 and about 1295 in memory of his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], who died in November 1290, marking the nightly resting-places along the route taken when her body was transported to London. The crosses stood at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Grantham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], all in [[Lincolnshire]]; [[Geddington]] and [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]]; [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] and [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]]; [[St Albans]] and Waltham (now [[Waltham Cross]]) in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Cheapside]] in London; and Charing (now [[Charing Cross]]) in [[Westminster]]. Three \u2013 those at Geddington, Hardingstone and Waltham Cross \u2013 survive more or less intact; but the other nine, other than a few fragments, are lost. The largest and most ornate of the twelve was Charing Cross.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Procession and burials===\n[[File:Eleonora Eduard1.jpg|thumb|[[Eleanor of Castile]], Queen Consort of England 1272\u201390]]\n\nFollowing her death on 28 November 1290 at [[Harby, Nottinghamshire]], the body of Queen Eleanor was carried to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], about {{convert|7|mi|km}} away, where she was embalmed \u2013 probably either at the [[Gilbertine]] [[St Catherine's, Lincoln#St Catherine's|priory of St Catherine]] in the south of the city, or at the priory of the Dominicans.<ref>Powrie 1990, pp. 32\u201334.</ref> Her [[Organ (anatomy)|viscera]], less her heart, were buried in the Angel Choir of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] on 3 December.<ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 344.</ref> Eleanor's other remains were carried to London, a journey of about {{convert|180|mi|km}}, that lasted 12 days. Her body was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], at the feet of her father-in-law King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] on 17 December; while her heart was buried in the church of the London Dominicans' priory at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] (a house that she and Edward had heavily patronised) on 19 December, along with those of her young son [[Alphonso, Earl of Chester]], who had died in 1284, and of [[John de Vesci]], who had died in 1289.<ref name=\"cock344\">Cockerill 2014, p. 344.</ref>\n\n===Commemoration===\n====Tomb monuments====\nBoth the burial of Eleanor's body at Westminster and her visceral burial at Lincoln were subsequently marked by ornate [[effigial monument]]s, both with similar life-sized gilt bronze effigies cast by the goldsmith [[William Torell]].<ref>Colvin 1963, pp. 481\u201382.</ref><ref>Alexander and Binski 1987, pp. 364\u201366.</ref> Her heart burial at the Blackfriars was marked by another elaborate monument, but probably not with a life-sized effigy.<ref name=\"colv482_3\">Colvin 1963, pp. 482\u201383.</ref><ref>Hunter 1842, pp. 186\u201387.</ref><ref name=\"gall79_80\">Galloway 1914, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> The Blackfriars monument was lost following the priory's [[dissolution of the monasteries|dissolution]] in 1538.<ref name=\"colv482_3\"/><ref name=\"gall79_80\"/> The Lincoln monument was destroyed in the 17th century, but was replaced in 1891 with a reconstruction, not on the site of the original.<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.<ref>Botfield and Turner 1841.</ref> By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun. It is assumed that these last three were erected in 1294 or 1295, and that they were certainly finished before the financial crisis of 1297 which brought a halt to royal building works.<ref name=\"colv483_4\">Colvin 1963, pp. 483\u20134.</ref> A number of artists worked on the crosses, as the account rolls show, with a distinction generally drawn between the main structures, made locally under the direction of master masons appointed by the King, and the statues of Eleanor, made of [[Caen stone]], and other sculptural details, brought from London. Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275).

The crosses stood at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Grantham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], all in [[Lincolnshire]]; [[Geddington]] and [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]]; [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] and [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]]; [[St Albans]] and Waltham (now [[Waltham Cross]]) in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Cheapside]] in London; and Charing (now [[Charing Cross]]) in [[Westminster]].

Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.<ref>Botfield and Turner 1841.</ref> By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun.

Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the ''montjoies'', being of at least three rather than two tiers.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite journal |first=Joan |last=Evans |authorlink=Joan Evans (art historian) |title=A prototype of the Eleanor crosses |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=91 |year=1949 |pages=96\u201397 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Branner |authorlink=Robert Branner |chapter=The Montjoies of Saint Louis |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Fraser |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Hibbard |editor2-link=Howard Hibbard |editor3-first=Milton J. |editor3-last=Lewine |title=Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |year=1967 |pages=13\u201316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Zukowsky |title=Montjoies and Eleanor Crosses reconsidered |journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=39\u201344 }}</ref><ref name=\"colv484_5\"/><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 351.</ref>\n\n==The twelve crosses==\n===Lincoln===\n[[File:Lincoln 128a.jpg|thumb|upright|The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross]]\n<small>({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})</small><br/>\nEleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290.

It was a misogynistic troll-laden mess\". France refused to hand over the tapes for ''Star Dust'' (she accused him of physical abuse, and he responded by saying it was the other way around), though eventually he did, but not after filing a restraining order against le Fey.<ref name=\"sfweekly\" /> A court granted France a five-year restraining order against le Fey based on threatening and verbally abusive online messages she sent to him, as well as allegations that she had attempted to enter France's house without permission and physically threatened members of his family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/psych-folk-singer-songwriter-globelamp-strives-to-turn-her-struggles-into-art/|title=Psych-Folk Singer-Songwriter Globelamp Strives to Turn Her Struggles Into Art|first=Vincenza|last=Blank|date=February 14, 2017|website=LA Weekly}}</ref>\n\nThe restraining order was renewed in March 2019 because le Fey continued to \u201cverbally assault\u201d him and \u201cthreaten physical harm\u201d to him online, according to court documents. However, in an interview published in May after another hearing, after which Le Fey sought a restraining order against France, Le Fey's lawyer told ''Pitchfork'' in an email that \"The restraining order that was issued five years ago should never have been issued.\" The lawyer stated \"We believe that Mr. France sought this restraining order not because he is actually in fear of any physical harm, but rather he wants to silence Ms. Gomez from speaking out about their relationship and his physical assault on her.\" Le Fey was denied the restraining order, after not being able to physically serve him. According to a court document transcript obtained by ''Pitchfork'' of their January 2014 hearing, there was admission of France hitting Le Fey once by accident whilst being startled out of sleep and denied otherwise ever hitting her, kicking her, or threatening her with physical violence of any type. To the contrary, France alleged that Le Fey physical abused him on October 16, 2013, when he and le Fey were living together in his house in Olympia. \u201cOur fighting had gotten to a point that I feared for my life,\u201d court documents filed by France read. \u201cShe entered my house while I was asleep, jumped on me, strangled me, and punched me. She threw one of my canes at me, missing my head.\u201d (He was recovering from a broken leg at the time.)France also claimed that le Fey went to his parents\u2019 Los Angeles home twice without permission and opened the door. In his written statement, he claims that on one occasion, she told him over the phone, \u201cI\u2019m going to throw a fucking rock throught [sic] that window,\u201d and, \u201cIf your mother blocks me I am going to fucking tase her in the face.\u201d France also alleged multiple instances of \u201conline threats and harassment,\u201d including snooping through his email accounts, threatening to post a video of him naked, and threatening to share private information.

However, in an interview published in May after another hearing, after which Le Fey sought a restraining order against France, Le Fey's lawyer told ''Pitchfork'' in an email that \"The restraining order that was issued five years ago should never have been issued.\" The lawyer stated \"We believe that Mr. France sought this restraining order not because he is actually in fear of any physical harm, but rather he wants to silence Ms. Gomez from speaking out about their relationship and his physical assault on her.\" Le Fey was denied the restraining order, after not being able to physically serve him. According to a court document transcript obtained by ''Pitchfork'' of their January 2014 hearing, there was admission of France hitting Le Fey once by accident whilst being startled out of sleep and denied otherwise ever hitting her, kicking her, or threatening her with physical violence of any type. To the contrary, France alleged that Le Fey physical abused him on October 16, 2013, when he and le Fey were living together in his house in Olympia. \u201cOur fighting had gotten to a point that I feared for my life,\u201d court documents filed by France read. \u201cShe entered my house while I was asleep, jumped on me, strangled me, and punched me. She threw one of my canes at me, missing my head.\u201d (He was recovering from a broken leg at the time.)France also claimed that le Fey went to his parents\u2019 Los Angeles home twice without permission and opened the door. In his written statement, he claims that on one occasion, she told him over the phone, \u201cI\u2019m going to throw a fucking rock throught [sic] that window,\u201d and, \u201cIf your mother blocks me I am going to fucking tase her in the face.\u201d France also alleged multiple instances of \u201conline threats and harassment,\u201d including snooping through his email accounts, threatening to post a video of him naked, and threatening to share private information. Le Fey also recounted an alleged incident where he physically threatened her life.<ref name=\"pitchforkcase\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/foxygens-sam-france-and-ex-bandmate-elizabeth-le-fey-trade-domestic-violence-claims-in-court-and-online/|title=Foxygen\u2019s Sam France and Ex-Bandmate Elizabeth le Fey Trade Domestic Violence Claims in Court and Online|website=pitchfork.com|accessdate=25 August 2019|date=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Star Dust''===\n\n''Star Dust'' began as a lo-fi 8 track cassette recording experiment, recorded in many different houses across the United States.<ref name=\"tristateindie\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tristateindie.com/globelampstardust/|title=Folk-Psychedelia band, Globelamp releases solo debut 'Star Dust'|website=tristateindie.com|date=5 June 2014|first=Alexa|last=Knoll|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"globaltexanchronicals\">{{cite web|url=http://globaltexanchronicles.com/3-reasons-globelamp/|title=3 Reasons Why Globelamp|website=globaltexanchronicles.com|date=7 February 2015|first=Walter|last=Price|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> Le Fey first released ''Star Dust'' as an EP before re-releasing it as a full length, a year later on June 3, 2014 through Gazelle Recordings, holding six additional tracks. <ref name=\"cooperpointjournal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperpointjournal.com/2014/09/21/best-new-music-globelamp-star-dust/|title=Best New Music: Globelamp \u2013 \u201cStar Dust\u201d|website=cooperpointjournal.com|first=Blaine|last=Ewen|date=21 September 2014|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccompanying the release of ''Star Dust'', Le Fey released a music video for the song \"Breathing Ritual\", June 2014.<ref name=\"thedelimagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://m-atx.thedelimagazine.com/category/bands/globelamp|title=Video: Globelamp, \"Breathing Rituals\"|website=thedelimagazine|date=4 June 2014|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"buzzbands\">{{cite web|url=http://buzzbands.la/2014/06/02/video-premiere-globelamp-breathing-ritual/|title=Video premiere: Globelamp, \u2018Breathing Ritual\u2019|website=buzzbands.la|first=Sepaphina|last=Lotkhamnga|date=2 June 2014|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Covers Album''===\n\nIn November 2014, le Fey produced and self released a covers album.<ref name=fortherabbits />\n\n===''The Orange Glow''===\n\nIn May 2015 she opened for [[Laura Jane Grace]] in New York City at [[City Winery]], and in Los Angeles at Hollywood Forever's Masonic Lodge.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/show-review-laura-jane-grace-globelamp-city-winery-nyc/|title=Show Review: Laura Jane Grace and Globelamp at City Winery in NYC -

Caverject and Edex are similarly fast-acting, but instead are injected by syringe directly into the [[corpus cavernosum penis|corpus cavernosum of the penis]].\n\nAlprostadil is also available as a generic. The major cost is that it must be mixed by a [[compounding|compounding pharmacy]] and supplies may be difficult to obtain. The different formulations, including Bimix and [[Trimix (injection)|Trimix]], may include [[papaverine]] and/or [[phentolamine]]. A typical mix might be 30&nbsp;mg of papaverine, 2&nbsp;mg of phentolamine, and  20 \u03bcg alprostadil.  As a generic, it is much less expensive than the packaged injectables.

The institution of the presidency began after the declaration of independence on 8 September 1991. The first [[President (government title)|president]] was [[Kiro Gligorov]], the oldest president in the world until his resignation in 1999.

Williams then went on to win the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris when [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] withdrew from the final, and the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in [[Antwerp|Antwerp, Belgium]], defeating Henin in the final. As a result of her strong start to the season, Williams assumed the world No. 1 position for the first time on February 25, dislodging Capriati. Williams was the first African-American woman ever to hold the ranking. She held it for just three weeks before surrendering it back to Capriati.\n\nWilliams failed to defend her title in Miami after losing in the semifinals to her sister Serena. However, she made a strong start to the clay-court season, winning the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island, Florida]], defeating Henin in the final. A week after winning that tournament, she once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1, before losing it again to Capriati after three weeks.

However, there, she lost to her sister Serena. This result meant Serena Williams replaced Venus as the No. 1. The Williams sisters teamed up to win the women's doubles title at the event, their fifth Grand Slam women's doubles title together.\n\nWilliams won the titles in San Diego and New Haven for the third consecutive year, defeating Davenport and Dokic to win the former and defeating Davenport in the final of the latter. At the [[2002 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]], Williams defeated Seles in the quarterfinals and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] in three sets to make the final. Playing her younger sister Serena for their third consecutive Grand Slam final, her sister won once again. After that, Williams played just four more matches during the season. She reached the semifinals at the year-ending [[2001 WTA Tour Championships \u2013 Singles|Sanex Championships]] after defeating Seles in the quarterfinals, but she then was forced to retire against Clijsters due to injury. Williams finished the year ranked No. 2 having won seven titles, her best showing in both respects of her career.\n\n===2003\u201306: Injuries and losses===\n====2003: Australian Open final and injuries====\nWilliams started 2003 by defeating fifth seed [[Justine Henin]] to make the final of the [[2003 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Australian Open]] for the first time. In the final, however, she lost to her sister Serena. This marked the first time in the open era that the same two players had met in four consecutive Grand Slam finals. Venus and Serena Williams teamed to win the women's doubles title at the event, their sixth Grand Slam title in women's doubles.\n\nIn February, Williams won the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in [[Antwerp, Belgium]] for the second consecutive year, defeating [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final. However, shortly afterwards, she began to struggle with injury. She reached the final of the clay-court [[J&S Cup]] in Warsaw, before being forced to retire against [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]].

Williams defeated former champion [[Lindsay Davenport]] in the quarterfinals and [[Kim Clijsters]] in the semifinals to advance to her fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, where she lost again to sister Serena.\n\nWimbledon was Williams's last event of the year as an abdominal injury that occurred during the Clijsters match prevented her from playing again.

As the third seed because of a protected ranking, she reached the third round of the Australian Open, where she lost to [[Lisa Raymond]]. She then lost in the quarterfinals of her next three tournaments.\n\nWilliams began to find her form at the beginning of the clay-court season. At the [[Tier I]] [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Williams defeated [[Conchita Mart\u00ednez]] in the final to win her first title in over a year and the second Tier I title on clay of her career. She then won in Warsaw, defeating [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the final, before reaching the final of the Tier I [[Qatar Telecom German Open|German Open]] in Berlin. She then withdrew from that match against Mauresmo due to injury. Going into the [[2004 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], Williams had the best clay-court record among the women and was among the favorites to win the title; however, after making the quarterfinals to extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, she lost to eventual champion [[Anastasia Myskina]].

In the final, Williams was a set and a service break up against Mauresmo before eventually losing.\n\nIn March, at the [[NASDAQ-100 Open]] in Miami, Williams defeated sister and Australian Open champion Serena Williams in the quarterfinals, the first time she had defeated her sister Serena since 2001. Williams went on to lose in the semifinals to No. 3 Sharapova. In May, Williams won her first title in over a year at the clay-courts at the [[\u0130stanbul Cup]], defeating [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]] in the final. However, at the French Open, she lost in the third round to 15-year-old [[Sesil Karatantcheva]], who subsequently tested positive for steroids and was suspended.\n\nWilliams was seeded 14th for the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles]]. In the quarterfinals of the tournament, she defeated French Open runner-up Pierce in a second-set tiebreak, winning it 12\u201310 to make the semifinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in two years. There, she defeated defending champion and second-seeded [[Maria Sharapova]] to make the Wimbledon final for the fifth time in six years. Playing top-seeded Davenport in the final, Williams saved a match point with a backhand winner en route to winning.

She returned in late April on clay in Warsaw, where she defeated former No. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] in the second round, before losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals. Williams completed the clay-court season by reaching the quarterfinals of the [[2006 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], where she lost to [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]].\n\nWilliams was the defending champion and one of the favorites to win the singles title at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]]. However, she lost in the third round to 26th-seeded [[Jelena Jankovi\u0107]]. After the loss, Williams said that she was having pain in her left wrist, although she admitted that the injury was not the cause of her loss. Williams did not play in the [[US Open Series|US Open series]] or the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] itself due to the wrist injury. In October, during her first tournament in almost three months, she reinjured her wrist at the [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|tournament in Luxembourg]] and lost in the second round to qualifier [[Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska]]. Williams finished the season as No. 46, her lowest finish since she began to play on the WTA Tour full-time in 1997. It was the second consecutive year she finished higher than her sister Serena, who finished the year at No. 95.\n\n===2007\u201310: Return to form and No. 2 ranking===\n====2007: Fourth Wimbledon title====\nWilliams withdrew from the [[2007 Australian Open]], the second consecutive Grand Slam that she had missed due to her recurring wrist injury.

She also lost to fourth seed Jankovi\u0107 in the third round of the [[2007 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], her third consecutive loss to Jankovi\u0107. During her second round win over [[Ashley Harkleroad]], Williams hit a {{convert|206|km/h|mi/h|abbr=on}} serve, which was the second fastest woman's serve ever recorded and the fastest ever recorded during a main draw match at the time.\n[[File:Venus Williams WTT.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Venus competing in the World Tennis Team (WTT)]]\nWilliams was ranked No. 31 going into [[2007 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]] and was seeded 23rd at the tournament due to her previous results at Wimbledon.

At the [[2008 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]], Williams was playing some of her best tennis since dominating the circuit in 2003, However, she was defeated in two tiebreaks by Serena Williams (the eventual tournament winner) in a close quarterfinal match, after Williams had led 5\u20133 in both sets.\n\n[[File:Venus Williams at the 2008 WTA Tour Championships.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Venus Williams at the 2008 WTA Tour Championships]]\nAt the [[Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart, Germany]] in October, Williams defeated a player ranked in the top three for the first time that season by defeating No. 3 [[Dinara Safina]] to reach her third semifinal of the year.

Williams rebounded in singles play in February at the Premier 5 (formerly Tier I) [[Dubai Tennis Championships]], defeating defending champion and No. 4 Dementieva in the quarterfinals and No. 1 Serena Williams in the semifinals on a third set tiebreak. The latter win meant that Williams led the head-to-head in career matches with her sister for the first time since 2002. Williams went on to defeat [[Virginie Razzano]] in the final. This win meant Williams was ranked in the top five for the first time since 2003, while it also marked her 40th professional singles title, only the twelfth player in the open era to achieve the feat.<ref name=\"2009 Memphis win\">[http://www.wtatennis.com/1/newsroom/stories/?ContentID=3015 Williams Beats Razzano for 40th Career Singles Title] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Williams won another title the following week at the [[Abierto Mexicano Telcel]] in [[Acapulco, Mexico]], defeating Pennetta in the final.

She lost her first match against Dementieva, and her second match against her sister Serena- both in straight sets, after taking the first set.

In doubles, she teamed with her sister Serena to successfully defend their title, defeating the top-ranked team of [[Cara Black]] and [[Liezel Huber]] in the final. She went onto the [[clay courts|clay]] at the [[2010 Abierto Mexicano Telcel|Abierto Mexico Telcel]] in Acapulco, where she was the defending champion. She reached the semifinals after recovering from a 1\u20135 third set deficit to [[Laura Pous Ti\u00f3]] in the quarterfinals.

She defeated No. 9 [[Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska]] in the quarterfinals and No. 13 [[Marion Bartoli]] in the semifinals to reach her third straight WTA tour final and fourth Sony Ericsson Open final. She was defeated by [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final in just 58 minutes, ending her 15-match winning streak. By reaching the final, her ranking improved to No. 4 and she crossed the $26&nbsp;million mark in career prize money, the only player besides Serena Williams to do so.\n\nThe knee injury that hampered her during the final of the Sony Ericsson Open forced her to skip the [[Fed Cup]] tie against Russia and the [[2010 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart. Williams returned to the tour at the Premier 5 [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome.

They then defeated 12th seeded [[Kv\u011bta Peschke]] and [[Katarina Srebotnik]] in the final to win their fourth consecutive Grand Slam women's doubles title. By virtue of reaching the No. 1-ranking in doubles on June 7, 2010, Venus and Serena became just the 6th and 7th women to reach the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles following in the footsteps of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, and Kim Clijsters.\n\nHer next tournament was the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she had reached the final the previous three years. Despite her knee injury, she made it to the quarterfinals, where she lost to [[Tsvetana Pironkova]]. Pironkova was ranked No. 82 and had never gone past the second round of a Grand Slam event. As a result, Williams dropped to No. 4. She was the defending champion in doubles with her sister Serena, having won the tournament in the previous two years. However, they lost this time in the quarterfinals to [[Elena Vesnina]] and [[Vera Zvonareva]].\n\nWilliams then missed all tournaments in the [[2010 US Open Series|US Open Series]] because of a left knee injury but still participated at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] as the third seed.

Williams won the first set of their match and recovered from 5\u20132 down in the second set but ultimately double-faulted on a key point near the end of the match and lost in three sets. Because of Serena's withdrawal from the US Open, Williams did not participate at the doubles event, where she was the defending champion.\n\nThe recovery of her left knee took longer than expected and it forced her to miss the rest of 2010, including the year-ending [[2010 WTA Tour Championships|Sony Ericsson Championships]] and [[2010 Fed Cup|Fed Cup final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usta.com/venus_williams_out_for_the_remainder_of_2010_will_miss_fed_cup_final/ |title=Venus Williams out for the remainder of 2010; Will miss Fed Cup Final, Pro Tennis \u2013 News |publisher=USTA |date=October 6, 2010 |accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> Williams ended the year ranked fifth in singles, the first time she ended a year in the top five since 2002, while playing only nine tournaments.

She subsequently withdrew from the [[Miami Open (tennis)|Miami Open]] causing her ranking to drop to number fifteen. She also missed the clay court season which caused her ranking to drop to number twenty-nine.

Retrieved July 6, 2008.</ref> Although WTA tour President [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] commented that she left \"a very meaningful impression\", Williams's demands were rejected.\n\nThe turning point was an essay published in ''[[The Times]]'' on the eve of Wimbledon in 2006. In it, Williams accused Wimbledon of being on the \"wrong side of history\", writing:\n\n{{quote|I feel so strongly that Wimbledon's stance devalues the principle of meritocracy and diminishes the years of hard work that women on the tour have put into becoming professional tennis players.<br />I believe that athletes \u2013 especially female athletes in the world's leading sport for women \u2013 should serve as role models. The message I like to convey to women and girls across the globe is that there is no glass ceiling. My fear is that Wimbledon is loudly and clearly sending the opposite message....<br />Wimbledon has argued that women's tennis is worth less for a variety of reasons; it says, for example, that because men play a best of five sets game they work harder for their prize money.<br />This argument just doesn\u2019t make sense; first of all, women players would be happy to play five sets matches in grand slam tournaments....<br />Secondly, tennis is unique in the world of professional sports. No other sport has men and women competing for a grand slam championship on the same stage, at the same time. So in the eyes of the general public the men's and women's games have the same value.<br />Third,&nbsp;... we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators, not the amount of time we spend on the stage. And, for the record, the ladies\u2019 final at Wimbledon in 2005 lasted 45 minutes longer than the men's....<br />Wimbledon has justified treating women as second class because we do ''more'' for the tournament. The argument goes that the top women \u2013 who are more likely also to play doubles matches than their male peers \u2013 earn more than the top men if you count singles, doubles and mixed doubles prize money. So the more we support the tournament, the more unequally we should be treated! But doubles and mixed doubles are separate events from the singles competition. Is Wimbledon suggesting that, if the top women withdrew from the doubles events, that then we would deserve equal prize money in singles? And how then does the All England Club explain why the pot of women's doubles prize money is nearly \u00a3130,000 smaller than the men's doubles prize money?<br />I intend to keep doing everything I can until [[Billie Jean King|Billie Jean's]] original dream of equality is made real. It's a shame that the name of the greatest tournament in tennis, an event that should be a positive symbol for the sport, is tarnished.<ref name=venus/>}}\n\nIn response, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and members of Parliament publicly endorsed Williams's arguments.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/5119748.stm |title=Blair adds support for equal pay |date=June 28, 2006 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, the Women's Tennis Association and [[UNESCO]] teamed for a campaign to promote gender equality in sports, asking Williams to lead the campaign.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/sports/EU_SPT_TEN_WTA_Tour_UNESCO.php WTA Tour and UNESCO to promote gender equality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154922/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/sports/EU_SPT_TEN_WTA_Tour_UNESCO.php |date=May 6, 2008 }}, ''International Herald Tribune'', November 11, 2006.

[[Serena Williams]] has since joined these 2 women in completing this feat when she won gold in the Singles at [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Summer Olympics]].\n* By winning the [[2001 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Doubles|2001 Australian Open doubles championship]], [[Williams Sisters|Venus and Serena Williams]] became the fifth pair to complete a Career Doubles Grand Slam, and the only pair to win a Career Doubles Golden Slam.\n* The [[2001 US Open (tennis)|2001 US Open]] marked the first time in the open era, and only the second time in 117 years, that [[Williams Sisters|sisters]] met in a Grand Slam singles final (with [[Serena Williams]]).\n* In 2001, she became the third woman in the open era, after [[Martina Navratilova|Navratilova]] and [[Steffi Graf|Graf]], to win both Wimbledon and the US Open in consecutive years.\n* In February 2002, she became the first African-American woman to become world No. 1 since the computer rankings began in 1975.\n* In March 2002, at the Miami Open, her record streak of 22 consecutive wins (won the 1998, 1999, and 2001 titles [skipped 2000]) came to an end at the hands of her sister, [[Serena Williams|Serena]], who would go on to win the 2002 title. Serena Williams would also win the 2003 and 2004 titles by winning 18 consecutive matches. In the [[2005 NASDAQ-100 Open \u2013 Women's Singles#Finals|2005 Miami Open]], Venus would play her sister Serena Williams in the quarterfinals after her sister Serena won her 21st consecutive match in the third round. Venus would end up defeating her younger sister in straight sets, including a riveting 7\u20136 (10\u20138) second set, to halt her streak one win short of tying Venus' record.\n* On June 10, 2002, Venus and Serena Williams became the first sisters to hold the No. 1 and No. 2 spots in the singles rankings, respectively.

She won the 2008 WTA Finals and then the inaugural WTA Elite Trophy in 2015. \n* By reaching the semifinals of the [[2016 Wimbledon Championships]], Williams became the oldest woman (at 36 years) to progress to a Grand Slam semifinal since Martina Navratilova in 1994 at Wimbledon.

Williams also won the [[2001 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]] singles title for the second consecutive year, without dropping a set. In the quarterfinals, she beat fifth-seeded Clijsters, followed by a semifinal victory over No. 2 Capriati. She played her sister Serena in the final, which was the first Grand Slam singles final contested by two sisters during the open era. Venus won the match and her fourth Grand Slam singles title. Williams also became only the sixth woman in history to win the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open in consecutive years, the others being [[Martina Navratilova]] (twice), [[Steffi Graf]] (twice), [[Althea Gibson]], [[Maureen Connolly Brinker]], and [[Helen Wills Moody]] (twice).\n\n====2002: World No. 1 ranking and 4 consecutive Grand Slam singles finals====\nWilliams began 2002 by winning the [[Mondial Australian Women's Hardcourts]] in [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast, Australia]], defeating Henin in the final. However, she then lost for the first time in her career to Seles in the quarterfinals of the [[2002 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Australian Open]]. Williams then went on to win the [[Open Gaz de France]] in Paris when [[Jelena Doki\u0107]] withdrew from the final, and the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in [[Antwerp|Antwerp, Belgium]], defeating Henin in the final. As a result of her strong start to the season, Williams assumed the world No. 1 position for the first time on February 25, dislodging Capriati. Williams was the first African-American woman ever to hold the ranking. She held it for just three weeks before surrendering it back to Capriati.\n\nWilliams failed to defend her title in Miami after losing in the semifinals to her sister Serena. However, she made a strong start to the clay-court season, winning the [[Bausch & Lomb Championships]] in [[Amelia Island, Florida]], defeating Henin in the final. A week after winning that tournament, she once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1, before losing it again to Capriati after three weeks. During those three weeks, Williams had made the final in Hamburg, defeating Hingis in the semifinals before losing to Clijsters in the final. Seeded second at the [[2002 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], Williams defeated former champion Seles to reach the semifinals for the first time. There, she defeated [[Clarisa Fern\u00e1ndez]]. In the final, Williams met her sister Serena Williams for a second time in a Grand Slam final, with her sister winning. Williams once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1 as a result of reaching the final.\n\nAs the top seed at [[2002 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], Williams defeated Henin in the semifinals to make the final for the third consecutive year. However, there, she lost to her sister Serena. This result meant Serena Williams replaced Venus as the No. 1. The Williams sisters teamed up to win the women's doubles title at the event, their fifth Grand Slam women's doubles title together.\n\nWilliams won the titles in San Diego and New Haven for the third consecutive year, defeating Davenport and Dokic to win the former and defeating Davenport in the final of the latter. At the [[2002 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]], Williams defeated Seles in the quarterfinals and [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]] in three sets to make the final. Playing her younger sister Serena for their third consecutive Grand Slam final, her sister won once again. After that, Williams played just four more matches during the season. She reached the semifinals at the year-ending [[2001 WTA Tour Championships \u2013 Singles|Sanex Championships]] after defeating Seles in the quarterfinals, but she then was forced to retire against Clijsters due to injury. Williams finished the year ranked No. 2 having won seven titles, her best showing in both respects of her career.\n\n===2003\u201306: Injuries and losses===\n====2003: Australian Open final and injuries====\nWilliams started 2003 by defeating fifth seed [[Justine Henin]] to make the final of the [[2003 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Australian Open]] for the first time. In the final, however, she lost to her sister Serena. This marked the first time in the open era that the same two players had met in four consecutive Grand Slam finals. Venus and Serena Williams teamed to win the women's doubles title at the event, their sixth Grand Slam title in women's doubles.\n\nIn February, Williams won the [[Proximus Diamond Games]] in [[Antwerp, Belgium]] for the second consecutive year, defeating [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final. However, shortly afterwards, she began to struggle with injury. She reached the final of the clay-court [[J&S Cup]] in Warsaw, before being forced to retire against [[Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo]]. She then suffered her earliest exit at a Grand Slam tournament in two years when she lost in the fourth round of the [[2003 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]] to [[Vera Zvonareva]].\n\nAt [[2003 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], Williams was seeded fourth. Williams defeated former champion [[Lindsay Davenport]] in the quarterfinals and [[Kim Clijsters]] in the semifinals to advance to her fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, where she lost again to sister Serena.\n\nWimbledon was Williams's last event of the year as an abdominal injury that occurred during the Clijsters match prevented her from playing again. While she was recovering from the injury, her sister [[Yetunde Price]] was murdered.<ref>Keating, Gina; Tippit, Sarah.

As the third seed because of a protected ranking, she reached the third round of the Australian Open, where she lost to [[Lisa Raymond]]. She then lost in the quarterfinals of her next three tournaments.\n\nWilliams began to find her form at the beginning of the clay-court season. At the [[Tier I]] [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], Williams defeated [[Conchita Mart\u00ednez]] in the final to win her first title in over a year and the second Tier I title on clay of her career. She then won in Warsaw, defeating [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the final, before reaching the final of the Tier I [[Qatar Telecom German Open|German Open]] in Berlin. She then withdrew from that match against Mauresmo due to injury. Going into the [[2004 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], Williams had the best clay-court record among the women and was among the favorites to win the title; however, after making the quarterfinals to extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, she lost to eventual champion [[Anastasia Myskina]]. Despite her defeat, she re-entered the top 10.\n\nIn the [[2004 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon Women's Singles]], Williams lost a controversial second-round match to Croatian [[Karolina \u0160prem]].

She then won three very close matches against [[Petra Mandula]], [[Shikha Uberoi]] and [[Chanda Rubin]] to make the fourth round of the [[2004 US Open \u2013 Women's Singles|US Open]] where she lost to Davenport, the first time she had ever lost at the US Open prior to the semifinals. Williams completed the year by losing in the quarterfinals of three indoor tournaments in the fall, a period that included defeat in her first meeting with 17-year-old Wimbledon champion [[Maria Sharapova]] at the [[Zurich Open]]. Williams finished the year as No. 9 and did not qualify for the year-ending [[WTA Tour Championships]].\n\n====2005: Third Wimbledon title====\nIn 2005, Williams started the year by losing in the fourth round of the [[2005 Australian Open \u2013 Women's Singles|Australian Open]] to [[Alicia Molik]].

In May, Williams won her first title in over a year at the clay-courts at the [[\u0130stanbul Cup]], defeating [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]] in the final. However, at the French Open, she lost in the third round to 15-year-old [[Sesil Karatantcheva]], who subsequently tested positive for steroids and was suspended.\n\nWilliams was seeded 14th for the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles]]. In the quarterfinals of the tournament, she defeated French Open runner-up Pierce in a second-set tiebreak, winning it 12\u201310 to make the semifinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in two years. There, she defeated defending champion and second-seeded [[Maria Sharapova]] to make the Wimbledon final for the fifth time in six years. Playing top-seeded Davenport in the final, Williams saved a match point with a backhand winner en route to winning. This was Williams's third Wimbledon singles title, her fifth Grand Slam singles title overall and her first since 2001. It was the first time in 70 years that a player had won after being down match point during the women's final at Wimbledon.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In addition, Williams was the lowest-ranked (No. 16) and lowest-seeded (14th) champion in tournament history.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Williams returned to the top 10 following the victory.\n\nFollowing Wimbledon, Williams reached her fourth final of the year in Stanford, where she lost to Clijsters.

After that loss, she did not play again for three months due to a wrist injury. She returned in late April on clay in Warsaw, where she defeated former No. 1 [[Martina Hingis]] in the second round, before losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals. Williams completed the clay-court season by reaching the quarterfinals of the [[2006 French Open \u2013 Women's Singles|French Open]], where she lost to [[Nicole Vaidi\u0161ov\u00e1]].\n\nWilliams was the defending champion and one of the favorites to win the singles title at [[2006 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|Wimbledon]]. However, she lost in the third round to 26th-seeded [[Jelena Jankovi\u0107]]. After the loss, Williams said that she was having pain in her left wrist, although she admitted that the injury was not the cause of her loss. Williams did not play in the [[US Open Series|US Open series]] or the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] itself due to the wrist injury. In October, during her first tournament in almost three months, she reinjured her wrist at the [[Fortis Championships Luxembourg|tournament in Luxembourg]] and lost in the second round to qualifier [[Agnieszka Radwa\u0144ska]]. Williams finished the season as No. 46, her lowest finish since she began to play on the WTA Tour full-time in 1997.

She was defeated by [[Kim Clijsters]] in the final in just 58 minutes, ending her 15-match winning streak. By reaching the final, her ranking improved to No. 4 and she crossed the $26&nbsp;million mark in career prize money, the only player besides Serena Williams to do so.\n\nThe knee injury that hampered her during the final of the Sony Ericsson Open forced her to skip the [[Fed Cup]] tie against Russia and the [[2010 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Porsche Tennis Grand Prix]] in Stuttgart. Williams returned to the tour at the Premier 5 [[2010 Internazionali BNL d'Italia|Internazionali BNL d'Italia]] in Rome.

By virtue of reaching the No. 1-ranking in doubles on June 7, 2010, Venus and Serena became just the 6th and 7th women to reach the No. 1 ranking in both singles and doubles following in the footsteps of Martina Navratilova, Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario, Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport, and Kim Clijsters.\n\nHer next tournament was the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon Championships]], where she had reached the final the previous three years.

Overall, Venus has won 12 of those matches and Serena Williams has won 18. They have met in 15 Grand Slam tournaments, with Venus Williams winning five matches to her sister Serena's ten. They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Venus winning twice. Of the six occasions where they met in an earlier round, the victor has gone on to win the championship four times (Venus once, in the [[2000 Wimbledon Championships]]).\n\nBeginning with the [[2002 French Open]], they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, which was the first time in the [[Tennis open era|open era]] that the same two players had contested four consecutive major finals.\n\n===Williams vs. Hingis===\nWilliams and [[Martina Hingis|Hingis]] met 21 times during their careers. The overall head-to-head series is 11\u201310, in Hingis' favor. Their rivalry is one of the best in women's sports and has been called a \"rivalry for the ages\". The pair met in the 1997 US Open final during Williams's debut, Hingis won the match in straight sets.\n\n===Williams vs. Davenport===\n[[Lindsay Davenport|Davenport]] leads the rivalry 14\u201313 in their 27 professional matches. Williams leads 3\u20130 in Grand Slam Finals. The most noteworthy match they played was the [[2005 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Women's Singles|2005 Wimbledon championships]] which broke the record for the longest Wimbledon women's final. Williams won the match and also saved a match point, which makes her only the second woman in the Open Era to save a match point and go on to win a Major final.\n\n==Fight for equal prize money==\nDespite years of protesting by tennis pioneer [[Billie Jean King]] and others, in 2005 the French Open and Wimbledon still refused to pay women's and men's players equally through all rounds. In 2005, Williams met with officials from both tournaments, arguing that female tennis players should be paid as much as male tennis players.<ref name=venus>Williams, Venus.

Retrieved July 6, 2008.</ref> Although WTA tour President [[Larry Scott (sports administrator)|Larry Scott]] commented that she left \"a very meaningful impression\", Williams's demands were rejected.\n\nThe turning point was an essay published in ''[[The Times]]'' on the eve of Wimbledon in 2006. In it, Williams accused Wimbledon of being on the \"wrong side of history\", writing:\n\n{{quote|I feel so strongly that Wimbledon's stance devalues the principle of meritocracy and diminishes the years of hard work that women on the tour have put into becoming professional tennis players.<br />I believe that athletes \u2013 especially female athletes in the world's leading sport for women \u2013 should serve as role models. The message I like to convey to women and girls across the globe is that there is no glass ceiling. My fear is that Wimbledon is loudly and clearly sending the opposite message....<br />Wimbledon has argued that women's tennis is worth less for a variety of reasons; it says, for example, that because men play a best of five sets game they work harder for their prize money.<br />This argument just doesn\u2019t make sense; first of all, women players would be happy to play five sets matches in grand slam tournaments....<br />Secondly, tennis is unique in the world of professional sports. No other sport has men and women competing for a grand slam championship on the same stage, at the same time. So in the eyes of the general public the men's and women's games have the same value.<br />Third,&nbsp;... we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators, not the amount of time we spend on the stage. And, for the record, the ladies\u2019 final at Wimbledon in 2005 lasted 45 minutes longer than the men's....<br />Wimbledon has justified treating women as second class because we do ''more'' for the tournament. The argument goes that the top women \u2013 who are more likely also to play doubles matches than their male peers \u2013 earn more than the top men if you count singles, doubles and mixed doubles prize money. So the more we support the tournament, the more unequally we should be treated! But doubles and mixed doubles are separate events from the singles competition. Is Wimbledon suggesting that, if the top women withdrew from the doubles events, that then we would deserve equal prize money in singles? And how then does the All England Club explain why the pot of women's doubles prize money is nearly \u00a3130,000 smaller than the men's doubles prize money?<br />I intend to keep doing everything I can until [[Billie Jean King|Billie Jean's]] original dream of equality is made real. It's a shame that the name of the greatest tournament in tennis, an event that should be a positive symbol for the sport, is tarnished.<ref name=venus/>}}\n\nIn response, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and members of Parliament publicly endorsed Williams's arguments.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/5119748.stm |title=Blair adds support for equal pay |date=June 28, 2006 |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=November 26, 2011}}</ref> Later that year, the Women's Tennis Association and [[UNESCO]] teamed for a campaign to promote gender equality in sports, asking Williams to lead the campaign.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/sports/EU_SPT_TEN_WTA_Tour_UNESCO.php WTA Tour and UNESCO to promote gender equality] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506154922/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/11/sports/EU_SPT_TEN_WTA_Tour_UNESCO.php |date=May 6, 2008 }}, ''International Herald Tribune'', November 11, 2006.
