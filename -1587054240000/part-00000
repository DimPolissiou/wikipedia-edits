The original founders of the organization were [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re]], [[Jean-Jacques Olier]] and Pierre Chevrier. They were later joined by [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and Jeanne Mance. The organization's mission was to convert the Indigenous population to Christianity and found a Christian settlement, which would be later known as Ville-Marie.\n\n== Founding and activities ==\nAccording to de la Dauversi\u00e8re, he conceived of the Society originated in an episode of divine inspiration sometime between the years of 1635-1636.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=60}}</ref> De la Dauversi\u00e8re, seeing great potential in the site for the conversion and civilizing of Native peoples, sought out likeminded individuals for his ambitious project. In 1639 his ideas caught the attention of Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fanchamp, who expressed great interest and enthusiasm for his plans.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> A friend of Chevrier, [[Jean-Jacques Olier]], future founder of the [[Saint-Sulpice Seminary (Montreal)|Seminary of St-Sulpice]] also expressed great interest in the project, donating a hundred pistoles to de la Dauversi\u00e8re and telling him to \"commence the work of God.\"<ref name=\"Atherton_61\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=61}}</ref> Olier was also instrumental in recruiting three more associates to the Society, most notably the [[Gaston Jean Baptiste de Renty|Baron de Renty]]. He played an important financial role as a financial benefactor for the project.<ref name=\"Atherton_61\"/> These six individuals would form the core of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al. \n\nThey intended to establish the colony for the purpose of the religious conversion of the Indigenous population, whom they considered pagans, and the development of a Christian settlement. The venture was very expensive, and the Society initially had trouble finding potential financiers.<ref>[[Marie-Claire Daveluy]], ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al : 1639-1663'' (Ottawa : Fides, 1965), 22.</ref>\n\nThe next step for these men was to acquire the rights to the Island of Montreal. At the time, the entire island had been ceded to a [[Jean de Lauson]], the intendant of [[Dauphin\u00e9]]. Through negotiations with [[Jean de Lauson|M. de Lauzon]], the territory was formally ceded to M. de la Dauvisiere and Chevrier on 17 December 1640. On the very same day the Society engaged itself to transport thirty men, and thirty tons of provisions to New France by its own means and vessels.<ref name=\"Atherton_64_65\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nPlanning for the eventual colonial project would take over the activities of the Society for the next year. This planning was extensive, meticulous, and closely modelled after the [[History of Quebec City|Quebec settlement]]. Ville-Marie, as the settlement was to be called, largely copied its three main institutions from the Quebec settlement. These were the clergy residences, a hospital, and a school for young Natives.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=65}}</ref> The next step for the Society was to choose a secular governor for the new colony. For this they required a man with certain military capabilities, proven leadership, and notable piety.<ref name=\"Atherton_64_65\"/> The man chosen to for the job was Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, who had a reputation for excellent military strategy, as well as piety. The King of France, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], in recognizing the cessation of the Island of Montreal to the Society, also named de Maisonneuve the Governor of the settlement and granted him the right to use artillery and other munitions of war. De Maisonneuve and Chevrier were then jointly tasked with the provision of equipment, rations, munitions, skilled workers, and soldiers needed for the colony.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=66}}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception the Society needed the presence of women in its colonial project. The establishment of a hospital was a key priority of the Society. Caring for the sick and wounded during this period was largely seen as women's work.<ref>{{harvp|Dollier de Casson|1928|p=75}}</ref> Needing female caregivers, the Society eventually took on four women, the most notable of which was [[Jeanne Mance]].<ref name=\"Atherton_68\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=68}}</ref> Mance was instrumental to the success of the society, as both a caregiver and as a financier. Though she had little of her own wealth to give to the mission, her resourcefulness in spreading the word of the Society to wealthy aristocratic women in Paris paid off greatly in the future donations these women gave to the colonial project.<ref name=\"Fenley_87\">{{harvp|Dollier de Casson|1928|p=87}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1641 three ships departed from La Rochelle to the New World with the mission of establishing a Christian colony on the Island of Montreal.<ref name=\"Fenley_87\"/> One ship contained de Maisonneuve and about twenty five men, a second ship containing Jeanne Mance and a dozen men, and a third containing three women and ten men.<ref name=\"Atherton_68\"/> The third ship arrived without issue and the second, containing Jeanne Mance, reached Quebec on August 8, 1641. de Maisonneuve's journey, wrought by misfortune and poor weather, caused him to lose several men and delay his arrival until August 20.<ref name=\"Atherton_68\"/> De Maisonneuve's two-week absence gave rise to ridicule of the Society's mission in [[New France]]. Public and elite opinion in Quebec began to center around talks of the mission as a \"foolhardy enterprise\". This opinion garnered much credibility from the recent skirmishes between Iroquois and the French, which led many to believe that the settlement, having so few men to defend it, would soon be destroyed by the Iroquois. Despite the ridicule his venture received, De Maisonneuve would have carried out his mission of colonization except for the coming winter weather. The expedition's arrival in late August had delayed the colonial project considerably. Given the recent Iroquois threat and the coming frost, de Maisonneuve decided to suspend the founding of Ville Marie until next spring, spending the winter in Ste-Foye with his crew.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> During the winter, Mance played a critical role in managing and storing the supplies.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=71}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the winter and early spring, boat construction went on busily in Ste-Foye. On May 8, 1642, de Maisonneuve's colonizing force set out for the Island of Montreal. The Flotilla consisted of a pinnacle, a Garbarre, and two Chaloupes.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=73}}</ref> On the 17th of May, the Society came into sight of the island and formally took possession of it. The next morning they made their landing at La Place Royale, an islet at the mouth of the stream which [[Samuel de Champlain]] had previously designated as a safe haven.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=73\u201374}}</ref> De Maisonneuve decided that on this spot would be where he erected his fort and settlement. That day an altar was erected by Jeanne Mance and the first Mass was held on the Island of Montreal.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=74}}</ref> This act symbolized the beginning of Ville Marie, the ambitious dream of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n==Early encounters with Natives==\nFrom the beginning, the area where the Society was founded was prone to attacks by neighboring Iroquois tribes. In 1650, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve returned to [[New France]], from a voyage to France during which he met with Jeanne Mance. Mance warned de Maisonneuve of the destruction of Huronia by the Iroquois. Huron survivors of the attack fled before the onslaught and \"passed by Ville Marie on their way to safety at Quebec \u2013 a sinister omen of things to come.\"<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\">{{harvp|B\u00e9chard|1986|p=337}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6 165, Jean Boudart and his wife were attacked by approximately 50 natives.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\"/> Boudart was killed and his wife was taken prisoner and later burnt at the stake. [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne]], Denis Archambault and an unnamed settler quickly ran in aid of the others under attack. The three men quickly realized they were outnumbered and the only way to ensure their personal safety was to flee and thus ran they in the direction of the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec|Hotel de Dieu]] hospital. As historian Henri B\u00e9chard writes, later, de Maisonneuve explained to the founder of Montreal, \"had the Iroquois passed by the hospital before these men found refuge in it , they would have plundered, burnt it, and captured Mademoiselle Mance.\"<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\"/> Four days later, on May 10, forty Iroquois attempted to set fire to the brewery as well as other establishments, mostly houses.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_338\">{{harvp|B\u00e9chard|1986|p=338}}</ref> The Iroquois would have succeeded in burning down the brewery had there not been four guards patrolling the area who effectively repelled them.\n\nOn June 18, 1651, four citizens were heading home from mass when they were confronted by a group of Iroquois.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_338\"/> When Governor Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve gained knowledge of the attack, he sent a relief party led by [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne]] to reinforce security in the area.

The original founders of the organization were [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me le Royer de la Dauversi\u00e8re]], [[Jean-Jacques Olier]] and Pierre Chevrier. They were later joined by [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]] and Jeanne Mance. The organization's mission was to convert the Indigenous population to Christianity and found a Christian settlement, which would be later known as Ville-Marie.\n\n== Founding and activities ==\nAccording to de la Dauversi\u00e8re, he conceived of the Society originated in an episode of divine inspiration sometime between the years of 1635-1636.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=60}}</ref> De la Dauversi\u00e8re, seeing great potential in the site for the conversion and civilizing of Native peoples, sought out likeminded individuals for his ambitious project. In 1639 his ideas caught the attention of Pierre Chevrier, Baron de Fanchamp, who expressed great interest and enthusiasm for his plans.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=60\u201361}}</ref> A friend of Chevrier, [[Jean-Jacques Olier]], future founder of the [[Saint-Sulpice Seminary (Montreal)|Seminary of St-Sulpice]] also expressed great interest in the project, donating a hundred pistoles to de la Dauversi\u00e8re and telling him to \"commence the work of God.\"<ref name=\"Atherton_61\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=61}}</ref> Olier was also instrumental in recruiting three more associates to the Society, most notably the [[Gaston Jean Baptiste de Renty|Baron de Renty]]. He played an important financial role as a financial benefactor for the project.<ref name=\"Atherton_61\"/> These six individuals would form the core of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al. \n\nThey intended to establish the colony for the purpose of the religious conversion of the Indigenous population, whom they considered pagans, and the development of a Christian settlement. The venture was very expensive, and the Society initially had trouble finding potential financiers.<ref>[[Marie-Claire Daveluy]], ''La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al : 1639-1663'' (Ottawa : Fides, 1965), 22.</ref>\n\nThe next step for these men was to acquire the rights to the Island of Montreal. At the time, the entire island had been ceded to a [[Jean de Lauson]], the intendant of [[Dauphin\u00e9]]. Through negotiations with [[Jean de Lauson|M. de Lauzon]], the territory was formally ceded to M. de la Dauvisiere and Chevrier on 17 December 1640. On the very same day the Society engaged itself to transport thirty men, and thirty tons of provisions to New France by its own means and vessels.<ref name=\"Atherton_64_65\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nPlanning for the eventual colonial project would take over the activities of the Society for the next year. This planning was extensive, meticulous, and closely modelled after the [[History of Quebec City|Quebec settlement]]. Ville-Marie, as the settlement was to be called, largely copied its three main institutions from the Quebec settlement. These were the clergy residences, a hospital, and a school for young Natives.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=65}}</ref> The next step for the Society was to choose a secular governor for the new colony. For this they required a man with certain military capabilities, proven leadership, and notable piety.<ref name=\"Atherton_64_65\"/> The man chosen to for the job was Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve, who had a reputation for excellent military strategy, as well as piety. The King of France, [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]], in recognizing the cessation of the Island of Montreal to the Society, also named de Maisonneuve the Governor of the settlement and granted him the right to use artillery and other munitions of war. De Maisonneuve and Chevrier were then jointly tasked with the provision of equipment, rations, munitions, skilled workers, and soldiers needed for the colony.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=66}}</ref>\n\nFrom its inception the Society needed the presence of women in its colonial project. The establishment of a hospital was a key priority of the Society. Caring for the sick and wounded during this period was largely seen as women's work.<ref>{{harvp|Dollier de Casson|1928|p=75}}</ref> Needing female caregivers, the Society eventually took on four women, the most notable of which was [[Jeanne Mance]].<ref name=\"Atherton_68\">{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=68}}</ref> Mance was instrumental to the success of the society, as both a caregiver and as a financier. Though she had little of her own wealth to give to the mission, her resourcefulness in spreading the word of the Society to wealthy aristocratic women in Paris paid off greatly in the future donations these women gave to the colonial project.<ref name=\"Fenley_87\">{{harvp|Dollier de Casson|1928|p=87}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1641 three ships departed from La Rochelle to the New World with the mission of establishing a Christian colony on the Island of Montreal.<ref name=\"Fenley_87\"/> One ship contained de Maisonneuve and about twenty five men, a second ship containing Jeanne Mance and a dozen men, and a third containing three women and ten men.<ref name=\"Atherton_68\"/> The third ship arrived without issue and the second, containing Jeanne Mance, reached Quebec on August 8, 1641. de Maisonneuve's journey, wrought by misfortune and poor weather, caused him to lose several men and delay his arrival until August 20.<ref name=\"Atherton_68\"/> De Maisonneuve's two-week absence gave rise to ridicule of the Society's mission in [[New France]]. Public and elite opinion in Quebec began to center around talks of the mission as a \"foolhardy enterprise\". This opinion garnered much credibility from the recent skirmishes between Iroquois and the French, which led many to believe that the settlement, having so few men to defend it, would soon be destroyed by the Iroquois. Despite the ridicule his venture received, De Maisonneuve would have carried out his mission of colonization except for the coming winter weather. The expedition's arrival in late August had delayed the colonial project considerably. Given the recent Iroquois threat and the coming frost, de Maisonneuve decided to suspend the founding of Ville Marie until next spring, spending the winter in Ste-Foye with his crew.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> During the winter, Mance played a critical role in managing and storing the supplies.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=71}}</ref>\n\nOver the course of the winter and early spring, boat construction went on busily in Ste-Foye. On May 8, 1642, de Maisonneuve's colonizing force set out for the Island of Montreal. The Flotilla consisted of a pinnacle, a Garbarre, and two Chaloupes.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=73}}</ref> On the 17th of May, the Society came into sight of the island and formally took possession of it. The next morning they made their landing at La Place Royale, an islet at the mouth of the stream which [[Samuel de Champlain]] had previously designated as a safe haven.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|pp=73\u201374}}</ref> De Maisonneuve decided that on this spot would be where he erected his fort and settlement. That day an altar was erected by Jeanne Mance and the first Mass was held on the Island of Montreal.<ref>{{harvp|Atherton|1914|p=74}}</ref> This act symbolized the beginning of Ville Marie, the ambitious dream of La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al.\n\n==Early encounters with Natives==\nFrom the beginning, the area where the Society was founded was prone to attacks by neighboring Iroquois tribes. In 1650, Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve returned to [[New France]], from a voyage to France during which he met with Jeanne Mance. Mance warned de Maisonneuve of the destruction of Huronia by the Iroquois. Huron survivors of the attack fled before the onslaught and \"passed by Ville Marie on their way to safety at Quebec \u2013 a sinister omen of things to come.\"<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\">{{harvp|B\u00e9chard|1986|p=337}}</ref>\n\nOn May 6 165, Jean Boudart and his wife were attacked by approximately 50 natives.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\"/> Boudart was killed and his wife was taken prisoner and later burnt at the stake. [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne]], Denis Archambault and an unnamed settler quickly ran in aid of the others under attack. The three men quickly realized they were outnumbered and the only way to ensure their personal safety was to flee and thus ran they in the direction of the [[H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec|Hotel de Dieu]] hospital. As historian Henri B\u00e9chard writes, later, de Maisonneuve explained to the founder of Montreal, \"had the Iroquois passed by the hospital before these men found refuge in it , they would have plundered, burnt it, and captured Mademoiselle Mance.\"<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_337\"/> Four days later, on May 10, forty Iroquois attempted to set fire to the brewery as well as other establishments, mostly houses.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_338\">{{harvp|B\u00e9chard|1986|p=338}}</ref> The Iroquois would have succeeded in burning down the brewery had there not been four guards patrolling the area who effectively repelled them.\n\nOn June 18, 1651, four citizens were heading home from mass when they were confronted by a group of Iroquois.<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_338\"/> When Governor Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve gained knowledge of the attack, he sent a relief party led by [[Charles le Moyne de Longueuil, Baron de Longueuil|Charles Le Moyne]] to reinforce security in the area. The Iroquois quickly fired all of their ammunition, and with few weapons left to attack with, the French were able to suppress the attack. From this moment on, \"the French were constantly harassed by the Iroquois and they no longer dared venture more than a few feet from their log-houses without their muskets, their pistols and swords. At night-time, nobody opened the door of his home to anyone.\"<ref name=\"B\u00e9chard_338\"/>\n\nAfter the attacks, de Maisonneuve called a meeting of all the French colonists in Ville-Marie and their families at which he instructed them to repair the fort and their residences.<ref>Daveluy M.C. & Laurent J., ''Jeanne Mance, 1606-1673'' (Montreal: Fides, 1962), 103.</ref> As Dollier de Casson wrote, \"as we grew weaker daily whilst the enemy grew bolder, on account of their great number, everyone saw quite plainly that unless powerful aid appeared very shortly from France, all would be lost.\"<ref>{{harvp|Dollier de Casson|1928|p=159}}</ref> Before departing back for France in 1651, de Maisonneuve met with the new governor of Ville-Marie who was also a member of the Society of Notre Dame, [[Jean de Lauson]]. De Lauson agreed to cover part of the cost of sending ten soldiers to reinforce the garrison at Ville-Marie. Lauson would stay true to the spirit of his word but fail on the technicalities.

Original shows listed the venue as Past the Pavement Hall, being as the county pavement ended about 3/4 of a mile from the building.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==History==\nIt hosted many acts from the time it was initially leased for [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] [[party|parties]] and [[motorcycle|biker]] bashes in 1985 until it was discovered by young [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|bands]] desperate for a place to perform. The first hardcore/[[alternative rock]] shows to play at The Outhouse were in the late summer/fall of 1985. Its doors were permanently closed in 1998. The growing mainstream popularity of pop punk music in the early 1990s was already leading to the decline of the Outhouse, but what ultimately led to its closing was the [[Great Flood of 1993]]. The building once known as the Outhouse is now a [[BYOB (acronym)|BYOB]] [[strip club]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe Outhouse was unique because it was a gutted cinder-block storage garage in the middle of a corn field. The walls (if any) had been torn out leaving only cinder-block walls. Original shows in 1985 featured no stage until a stage was built by volunteers from the University of Kansas student radio station, [[KJHK]], and various local bands. KJHK and others had made an arrangement with the [[Flaming Lips]] to play there and felt a stage was needed to attract other non-local acts. During the construction of the stage, it was suggested that the name be changed from Past the Pavement Hall. One KJHK staffer remarked that the place was a \"shithole\" and it should be called the Outhouse. The name stuck. Unfortunately, the Flaming Lips van broke down and the show never occurred.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the April 1986 issue of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', KJHK was recognized for \"excellence in supporting a local music scene\" for their work in bringing many national acts to the Outhouse and other [[Lawrence, Kansas]] music venues. It was a vibrant time for alternative live music in the midwest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe stage was a box that stood approximately a foot and a half above the cement floor. Much later, a bar area was added to the back that was used to sell [[T-shirt]]s, and other band merchandise, as well as refreshments. Alcohol was never served, but people often brought their own. At first alcohol was allowed in the club, but after the Outhouse received publicity in the local press, the Kansas ABC told the owner that it would begin enforcing the law at the Outhouse. Thereafter, alcohol was openly consumed in the parking-lot-front-yard, but not inside.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nPeople would park in the front yard, and for large concerts, they would often park on the nearby gravel road. The field across the street was rumored to have housed a [[missile silo]], but this was incorrect.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe building stood just outside the jurisdiction of the Lawrence police department. The Outhouse rarely had any sort of security, but negative incidents were rare. No one stood between the audience and the band.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nPrior to the Outhouse, venues such as [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] Halls in Kansas City and the Lawrence Opera House (later called Liberty Hall) would host hardcore concerts. When several of the local venues closed, the Outhouse quickly became the place to see punk shows. Concerts at the Outhouse were very inexpensive, with the first shows costing $3, and with $8 being the high end in the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nShows at the Outhouse weren't limited to the typical hardcore genre; there were [[ska]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], [[thrash metal]], [[Oi!]] and other types of [[Underground music|underground]] genres. People would come from as far as [[Topeka, Kansas]], [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] and sometimes further, and with the [[University of Kansas]] nearby, there was no shortage of patrons.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Notable performers==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n<!-- ONLY ADD A BAND TO THIS LIST IF THEY ALREADY HAVE AN ARTICLE IN THE ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA --> \n* [[24-7 Spyz]]\n* [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]]\n* [[Adolescents (band)|Adolescents]]\n* [[Adrenalin O.D.]]\n* [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]]\n* [[Agnostic Front]]\n* [[Alice Donut]]\n* [[All (band)|ALL]]\n* [[Anti-Flag]]\n* [[Antiseen|ANTiSEEN]]\n* [[Bad Brains]]\n* [[Big Drill Car]]\n* [[The Beatnigs]]\n* [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]]\n* [[Blue Meanies (Illinois band)|Blue Meanies]]\n* [[The Business (band)|The Business]]\n* [[Circle Jerks]]\n* [[Cro Mags]]\n* [[D.I.

The [[University of Kansas]]'s [[KJHK]] radio was instrumental in promoting Outhouse shows. In [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], the local public radio station, 90.1 [[KKFI]], had a two-hour hardcore/alternative show called ''The Little Orphan Annie Show'' (which went through several hosts and names), that would often announce concerts. The concerts were also sometimes announced in the local alternative newspaper ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]''. The most common promotion technique was plastering flyers in Lawrence and in areas like the [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport]] neighborhood of the Kansas City Metropolitan area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=tool>{{cite web\n| first       = Jon \n| last        = Niccum\n| title       = Right Tool for the job\n| date        = 2006-09-15\n| website     = [[Lawrence Journal World]]\n| url         = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/sep/15/right_tool_job/?living\n| accessdate  = 2006-10-10}}</ref>\n<ref name=sonic>{{cite web\n| title       = 11/05/86 - Lawrence, KS @ The Outhouse\n| date        = 1986-11-05\n| website     = [[Sonic Youth]]\n| url         = http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/cc/110586.html\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n| first       = Richard  \n| last        = Gintowt\n| title       = Inside the Outhouse\n| date        = 2003-02-19\n| website     = Lawrence.com\n| url         = http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/feb/19/inside_the/\n| accessdate  = 2006-10-10}}\n* {{cite web\n| title       = The Outhouse: The Film 1985 - 1998\n| date        = 2015-06-28\n| website     = The Outhouse Film\n| url         = http://www.theouthousethefilm.com\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28\n}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Andrea\n| last        = Enthal\n| title       = College Radio\n| website     = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]\n| date        = April 1986\n| page        = 110\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xdLsQBjl0-IC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Iain\n| last        = Ellis\n| title       = Hardcore Punks and Their Shenanigans in the Outhouse\n| website     = [[PopMatters]]\n| date        = 2018-01-08\n| url         = https://www.popmatters.com/hardcore-punks-outhouse-2515935846.html\n| accessdate  = 2020-03-21\n}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Melissa\n| last        = Lenos\n| title       = A Lawrence Filmmaker Documents How Going To The Outhouse Saved Young Punks\n| website     = [[KCUR-FM]]\n| date        = 2017-10-10\n| url         = https://www.kcur.org/post/lawrence-filmmaker-documents-how-going-outhouse-saved-young-punks\n| accessdate  = 2020-03-21}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Lisa\n| last        = Gutierrez\n| title       = Remember the Outhouse?

The [[University of Kansas]]'s [[KJHK]] radio was instrumental in promoting Outhouse shows. In [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], the local public radio station, 90.1 [[KKFI]], had a two-hour hardcore/alternative show called ''The Little Orphan Annie Show'' (which went through several hosts and names), that would often announce concerts. The concerts were also sometimes announced in the local alternative newspaper ''[[The Pitch (newspaper)|The Pitch]]''. The most common promotion technique was plastering flyers in Lawrence and in areas like the [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport]] neighborhood of the Kansas City Metropolitan area.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=tool>{{cite web\n| first       = Jon \n| last        = Niccum\n| title       = Right Tool for the job\n| date        = 2006-09-15\n| website     = [[Lawrence Journal World]]\n| url         = http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2006/sep/15/right_tool_job/?living\n| accessdate  = 2006-10-10}}</ref>\n<ref name=sonic>{{cite web\n| title       = 11/05/86 - Lawrence, KS @ The Outhouse\n| date        = 1986-11-05\n| website     = [[Sonic Youth]]\n| url         = http://www.sonicyouth.com/mustang/cc/110586.html\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web\n| first       = Richard  \n| last        = Gintowt\n| title       = Inside the Outhouse\n| date        = 2003-02-19\n| website     = Lawrence.com\n| url         = http://www.lawrence.com/news/2003/feb/19/inside_the/\n| accessdate  = 2006-10-10}}\n* {{cite web\n| title       = The Outhouse: The Film 1985 - 1998\n| date        = 2015-06-28\n| website     = The Outhouse Film\n| url         = http://www.theouthousethefilm.com\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28\n}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Andrea\n| last        = Enthal\n| title       = College Radio\n| website     = [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]\n| date        = April 1986\n| page        = 110\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xdLsQBjl0-IC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| accessdate  = 2015-06-28}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Iain\n| last        = Ellis\n| title       = Hardcore Punks and Their Shenanigans in the Outhouse\n| website     = [[PopMatters]]\n| date        = 2018-01-08\n| url         = https://www.popmatters.com/hardcore-punks-outhouse-2515935846.html\n| accessdate  = 2020-03-21\n}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Melissa\n| last        = Lenos\n| title       = A Lawrence Filmmaker Documents How Going To The Outhouse Saved Young Punks\n| website     = [[KCUR-FM]]\n| date        = 2017-10-10\n| url         = https://www.kcur.org/post/lawrence-filmmaker-documents-how-going-outhouse-saved-young-punks\n| accessdate  = 2020-03-21}}\n* {{cite news\n| first       = Lisa\n| last        = Gutierrez\n| title       = Remember the Outhouse?

The Habr Je'lo also partook in a major organised front to oppose British rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries under the leadership of [[Haji Sudi]] and other subsequent anti-colonial leaders hailing from the same clan. The Habr Je'lo are divided into three further sub-clans: the Mohammed Abokor, Musa Abokor, and Omar. Historically, the Mohammed Abokor were chiefly [[nomadic pastoralists]], whereas the Musa Abokor and Omar obtained much of their wealth via their [[frankincense]] plantations in the mountainous interior adjacent to the coastline.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XMoNDgAAQBAJ&|title= I.M Lewis: Peoples of the Horn of Afrcia.|first=}} |</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe Habr Je\u2019lo reside in eastern [[Togdheer]], western [[Sanaag]] and western [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions.

While the settlements were not as significant as the more established ports of Berbera, Zeila and Bulhar (respectively), the principle Habr Je\u2019lo port of Kurrum (Karin) was a major market for livestock and frankincense procured from the interior <ref>Ethnographie Nordost-Afrikas: Die Materielle Cultur Der Danakil, Galla Und Somal, 1893</ref>, and was a favorite for livestock traders due to the close proximity of the port to Aden. Habr Je\u2019lo traders acted as middlemen to Dhulbahante livestock herders in the interior by purchasing and/or bartering their stock for export to the Aden market:\n\n{{cquote|\u201cThe last branch of the Western tribes is the Haber el Jahleh, who possess the sea-ports from Seyareh to the ruined village of Rukudah, and as far as the town of Heis. Of these towns, Kurrum is the most important, from its possessing a tolerable harbour, and from its being the nearest point from Aden, the course to which place is N.N.W., consequently the wind is fair, and the boats laden with sheep for the Aden market pass but one night at sea, whilst those from Berbera are generally three. What greatly enhances the value of Kurrum however is its proximity to the country of the Dulbahanta, who approach within four days of Kurrum, and who therefore naturally have their chief trade through that port.<ref>The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Volume 19, p. 63, 1848</ref>}}\n\n===Anti-Colonial Movements===\n[[File:XaajiSuudicropped2.png |thumb|Haji Sudi on the left with his brother in-law Duale Idres. [[Aden]], 1892.]]\nThe Habr Je\u2019lo were one of the first clans in the Somaliland Protectrate to revolt against the Colonial government between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among their prominent anti-colonial ideologues during the Dervish period were Deria Arale, Deria Gure, Abdala Shihiri, [[Ibrahim Boghol]] and [[Haji Sudi]], the latter is credited for importing Dervish customs into the Somali peninsula as well as being one of the original founders of the Somali Dervish Movement. Moreover, the Habr Je'lo played an influential role after the demise of the Dervish Movement in 1920, with [[Sheikh Bashir Yussuf]] and [[Farah Omar]] being important anti-colonial notables.  \n[[File:Habr Je&#039;lo Horsemen, 1898.png|thumb|350px|Habr Je&#039;lo Horsemen, 1898]]\nThe Dervish movement first arose in Burao in 1899, where in the summer of that year Dervish leaders and their clan followers congregated at the settlement. Haji Suudi leading his clansmen declared war on the British lest they stop interfering with their religious and internal affairs. The dervish then proceeded to send this letter to Captain Cordeauxe and James Hayes Sadler:\n\n<blockquote>This is to inform you that you have done whatever you have desired, and oppressed our well-known religion without any cause. Further, to inform you that whatever people bring to you they are liars and slanderers. Further, to inform you that Mahomed, your Akil, came to ask from us the arms we therefore, send you this letter. Now choose for yourself; if you want war we accept it, if you want peace pay the fine.\" September 1, 1899.<ref>Sessional papers Volume 48. p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccoridng to the British War Office, the Ahmed Farah, Rer Yusuf and Adan Madoba Habr Je'lo sub-clans were among the first to join the Dervish rebellion. Haji Sudi, along with Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and Sultan Nur led the first Dervish forces against the British at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo and Gumburu.<ref>Official History of the Operation, Volume 1. p. 49</ref><ref>In pursuit of The Mad Mullah, Malcolm McNeil. p. 123</ref> Moreover, The coastal Habr Je'lo sub-clans provided significant armaments to the Dervish forces in the interior.<ref>Official History of the Operation, Volume 1. p. 41</ref> Before sending troops to confront the Dervish at Samala, Consul-General Hayes Sadler gave the following instructions to the commander Eric John Eagles Swayne:\n\n<blockquote>In the unlikely event of the Mullah offering to surrender, in his case and that of the Following: Haji Sudi, Deria Arale, Deria Gure Only an unconditional surrender should be accepted no guarantee of any kind to future treatment been given. Sultan Nur, the Sultan of the Habr Yunis, may be guaranteed his life.\" J. Hayes-Sadler, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Somali Coast Protectorate. Aden April 11, 1901.\"<ref>Official History of the Operations in Somaliland. 1901\u20131904 Vol. I p. 54</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough facing the British in multiple battles between 1901 and 1904, the colonial forces failed to in their efforts to apprehend Sudi, Arale, Gure and their fellow Dervishes. Gabriel Ferrand, the Vice-Consul of France following these events observed that:\n\n<blockquote>Neither the Mahdi nor his chief adviser Ahmed Warsama, better known under the name Haji Sudi, nor the Sultan Nur, leader of the Habr Younis clan were killed or captured. The optimism of Colonel Sadler and Lieutenant-Colonel Swayne in the latest reports relating to military operations is inexplicable.\"<ref>Les \u00c7om\u00e2lis. Ferrand Gabriel, 1903. p. 268.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbdalah Shihiri and Deria Arale led the 1904 Dervish delegation that facilitated the Ilig or Pestollaza agreement between the Dervish and Italy. This treaty allowed the Dervishes to peacefully settle in Italian Somaliland with some autonomy.<ref>Ministero della Guerra, Comando del Corpo di S.M./Ufficio Storico: SOMALIA, Vol. I, Dalle Original 1914, Roma, 1938- XVI, pp. 308, 309, 315, 318, 319.</ref><ref>Caroselli, op. cit. 78-9.</ref>\n\nIn 1920, the British air force commenced their bombardment of Dervish fort and their ground assault on Taleh fort.

The Habr Je'lo also partook in a major organised front to oppose British rule in the late 19th and early 20th centuries under the leadership of [[Haji Sudi]] and other subsequent anti-colonial leaders hailing from the same clan. The Habr Je'lo are divided into three further sub-clans: the Mohammed Abokor, Musa Abokor, and Omar. Historically, the Mohammed Abokor were chiefly [[nomadic pastoralists]], whereas the Musa Abokor and Omar obtained much of their wealth via their [[frankincense]] plantations in the mountainous interior adjacent to the coastline.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XMoNDgAAQBAJ&|title= I.M Lewis: Peoples of the Horn of Afrcia.|first=}} |</ref>\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe Habr Je\u2019lo reside in eastern [[Togdheer]], eastern [[Sahil, Somaliland|Sahil]], western [[Sanaag]] and western [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] regions.

While the settlements were not as significant as the more established ports of Berbera, Zeila and Bulhar (respectively), the principle Habr Je\u2019lo port of Kurrum (Karin) was a major market for livestock and frankincense procured from the interior <ref>Ethnographie Nordost-Afrikas: Die Materielle Cultur Der Danakil, Galla Und Somal, 1893</ref>, and was a favorite for livestock traders due to the close proximity of the port to Aden. Habr Je\u2019lo traders acted as middlemen to Dhulbahante livestock herders in the interior by purchasing and/or bartering their stock for export to the Aden market:\n\n{{cquote|\u201cThe last branch of the Western tribes is the Haber el Jahleh, who possess the sea-ports from Seyareh to the ruined village of Rukudah, and as far as the town of Heis. Of these towns, Kurrum is the most important, from its possessing a tolerable harbour, and from its being the nearest point from Aden, the course to which place is N.N.W., consequently the wind is fair, and the boats laden with sheep for the Aden market pass but one night at sea, whilst those from Berbera are generally three. What greatly enhances the value of Kurrum however is its proximity to the country of the Dulbahanta, who approach within four days of Kurrum, and who therefore naturally have their chief trade through that port.<ref>The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, Volume 19, p. 63, 1848</ref>}}\n\n===Anti-Colonial Movements===\n[[File:XaajiSuudicropped2.png |thumb|Haji Sudi on the left with his brother in-law Duale Idres. [[Aden]], 1892.]]\nThe Habr Je\u2019lo were one of the first clans in the Somaliland Protectrate to revolt against the Colonial government between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Among their prominent anti-colonial ideologues during the Dervish period were Deria Arale, Deria Gure, Abdala Shihiri, [[Ibrahim Boghol]] and [[Haji Sudi]], the latter is credited for importing Dervish customs into the Somali peninsula as well as being one of the original founders of the Somali Dervish Movement. Moreover, the Habr Je'lo played an influential role after the demise of the Dervish Movement in 1920, with [[Sheikh Bashir Yussuf]] and [[Farah Omar]] being important anti-colonial notables.  \n[[File:Habr Je&#039;lo Horsemen, 1898.png|thumb|350px|Habr Je&#039;lo Horsemen, 1898]]\nThe Dervish movement first arose in Burao in 1899, where in the summer of that year Dervish leaders and their clan followers congregated at the settlement. Haji Suudi leading his clansmen declared war on the British lest they stop interfering with their religious and internal affairs. The dervish then proceeded to send this letter to Captain Cordeauxe and James Hayes Sadler:\n\n<blockquote>This is to inform you that you have done whatever you have desired, and oppressed our well-known religion without any cause. Further, to inform you that whatever people bring to you they are liars and slanderers. Further, to inform you that Mahomed, your Akil, came to ask from us the arms we therefore, send you this letter. Now choose for yourself; if you want war we accept it, if you want peace pay the fine.\" September 1, 1899.<ref>Sessional papers Volume 48. p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccoridng to the British War Office, the Ahmed Farah, Rer Yusuf and Adan Madoba Habr Je'lo sub-clans were among the first to join the Dervish rebellion. Haji Sudi, along with Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and Sultan Nur led the first Dervish forces against the British at Samala, Ferdidin, Erigo and Gumburu.<ref>Official History of the Operation, Volume 1. p. 49</ref><ref>In pursuit of The Mad Mullah, Malcolm McNeil. p. 123</ref> Moreover, The coastal Habr Je'lo sub-clans provided significant armaments to the Dervish forces in the interior.<ref>Official History of the Operation, Volume 1. p. 41</ref> Before sending troops to confront the Dervish at Samala, Consul-General Hayes Sadler gave the following instructions to the commander Eric John Eagles Swayne:\n\n<blockquote>In the unlikely event of the Mullah offering to surrender, in his case and that of the Following: Haji Sudi, Deria Arale, Deria Gure Only an unconditional surrender should be accepted no guarantee of any kind to future treatment been given. Sultan Nur, the Sultan of the Habr Yunis, may be guaranteed his life.\" J. Hayes-Sadler, His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General, Somali Coast Protectorate. Aden April 11, 1901.\"<ref>Official History of the Operations in Somaliland. 1901\u20131904 Vol. I p. 54</ref></blockquote>\n\nAlthough facing the British in multiple battles between 1901 and 1904, the colonial forces failed to in their efforts to apprehend Sudi, Arale, Gure and their fellow Dervishes. Gabriel Ferrand, the Vice-Consul of France following these events observed that:\n\n<blockquote>Neither the Mahdi nor his chief adviser Ahmed Warsama, better known under the name Haji Sudi, nor the Sultan Nur, leader of the Habr Younis clan were killed or captured. The optimism of Colonel Sadler and Lieutenant-Colonel Swayne in the latest reports relating to military operations is inexplicable.\"<ref>Les \u00c7om\u00e2lis. Ferrand Gabriel, 1903. p. 268.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbdalah Shihiri and Deria Arale led the 1904 Dervish delegation that facilitated the Ilig or Pestollaza agreement between the Dervish and Italy. This treaty allowed the Dervishes to peacefully settle in Italian Somaliland with some autonomy.<ref>Ministero della Guerra, Comando del Corpo di S.M./Ufficio Storico: SOMALIA, Vol. I, Dalle Original 1914, Roma, 1938- XVI, pp. 308, 309, 315, 318, 319.</ref><ref>Caroselli, op. cit. 78-9.</ref>\n\nIn 1920, the British air force commenced their bombardment of Dervish fort and their ground assault on Taleh fort.

In [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] she is called ''Gyutrulma'' and in [[Japanese]] is known as ''Maya-bunin'' (\u6469\u8036\u592b\u4eba).

Maya is usually shown giving birth standing under a tree and reaching overhead to hold on to a branch for support. Buddhist scholar Miranda Shaw, states that Queen Maya's depiction in the nativity scene follows a pattern established in earlier Buddhist depictions of the tree spirits known as [[yaksini]].\n\n==Life of Maya==\n[[Image:MayaDream.jpg|thumb|Queen M\u0101y\u0101's white elephant dream, and the conception of the Buddha. [[Gandhara]], 2nd\u20133rd century CE.]]\n[[File:Indian Museum Sculpture - Dream of Mayadevi, Mardan (9218153969).jpg|thumb|Dream of Mayadevi, [[Mardan]].]]\n\nM\u0101y\u0101 married King [[Suddhodana|\u015auddhodana]] (P\u0101li: Suddhodana), the ruler of the [[Shakya|\u015a\u0101kya]] clan of [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilvastu]]. She was the daughter of King \u015auddhodhana's uncle and therefore his cousin; her father was king of [[Devadaha]].\n\nM\u0101y\u0101 and King Suddhodhana did not have children for twenty years into their marriage. According to legend, one full moon night, sleeping in the palace, the queen had a vivid dream. She felt herself being carried away by four devas (spirits) to Lake Anotatta in the Himalayas. After bathing her in the lake, the devas clothed her in heavenly cloths, anointed her with perfumes, and bedecked her with divine flowers. Soon after a white elephant, holding a white lotus flower in its trunk, appeared and went round her three times, entering her womb through her right side. Finally the elephant disappeared and the queen awoke, knowing she had been delivered an important message, as the elephant is a symbol of greatness.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha-to-be was residing as a ''[[bodhisattva]]'' in the [[Tushita|{{IAST|Tu\u1e63ita}}]] heaven, and decided to take the shape of a white elephant to be reborn on Earth for the last time. M\u0101y\u0101 gave birth to Siddharta c. 563 BCE. The pregnancy lasted ten lunar months. Following custom, the Queen returned to her own home for the birth. On the way, she stepped down from her [[palanquin]] to have a walk under the [[Sal tree]] (''Shorea robusta''), often confused with the [[Ashoka tree]] (''Saraca asoca''), in the beautiful flower garden of [[Lumbini]] Park, [[Lumbini Zone]], Nepal. Maya Devi was delighted by the park and gave birth standing while holding onto a sal branch. Legend has it that Prince Siddh\u0101rtha emerged from her right side. It was the eighth day of April. Some accounts say she gave him his first bath in the Puskarini pond in [[Lumbini Zone]]. But legend has it that [[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s caused it to rain to wash the newborn baby. He was later named Siddh\u0101rtha, \"He who has accomplished his goals\" or \"The accomplished goal\".\n\nScholars generally agree that most Buddhist literature holds that Maya died seven days after the birth of Buddha, and was then reborn in the [[Tushita|Tusita]] Heaven. Seven years after the Buddha's enlightenment, she came down to visit [[Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba|Tavatimsa]] Heaven, where the Buddha later preached the [[Abhidharma]] to her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.palikanon.com/english/pali_names/maha/mahamaayaa.htm|title=M\u0101y\u0101|website=www.palikanon.com|access-date=2018-04-07}}</ref> Her sister [[Mahapajapati Gotami|Praj\u0101pat\u012b]] (P\u0101li: Paj\u0101pat\u012b or Mah\u0101paj\u0101pat\u012b Gotam\u012b) became the child's foster mother.\n\nAfter Siddhartha had attained [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|Enlightenment]] and become the Buddha, he visited his mother in heaven for three months to pay respects and to teach the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]].\n\n==Cross-cultural analogies==\n{{See also|Comparison of Buddhism and Christianity}}\n\nReferring to the [[conception dreams|prophetic dream]] Queen Maya had prior to conception, the life story of the Buddha according to the Pali Canon say that his mother did not engage in sexual activity or entertain any thoughts of other men during her pregnancy.

In the years after 1960 the construction of private ''birkas'' (underground concrete water tanks), which greatly increased after 1970; by 1998 there were 128 clusters of ''birkas'', each cluster corresponding to the number of permanent or semi-permanent settlements in the woreda. By the 1980s, pastoralists grazing in Misraq Gashamo had all but stopped the trek to Burco and other wells in the dry season. While this allowed the area that was previously grazed mainly in the wet season to now be grazed throughout the dry season, it has also led to a serious decline in the native species most favored for fodder and grazing in this woreda.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/eue_web/past0698.htm \"Changing Pastoralism in the Ethiopian Somali National Regional State (Region 5)\"], UNDP Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia report, dated 30 May 1998 (accessed 22 December 20080</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\nBased on the 2007 Census conducted by the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] of Ethiopia (CSA), this woreda has a total population of 95,191, of whom 52,645 are men and 42,546 women.
