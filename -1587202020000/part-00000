However, FISH analyses of sperm, enabling hundreds of cells to be analyzed, have shown a very small increased faction of 24,YY spermatozoa in the ejaculate of XYY men (Table 12-1). Thus it appears the vast majority of spermatocytes lose the extra Y before entering meiosis, a very few XYY primary spermatocytes are able to slip through and produce YY (and XY) spermatozoa. These cytogenetic findings parallel the observation that XYY men have no ''discernible'' increase in risk to have children with a sex chromosome abnormality. A true increased risk of a fraction of a per cent could be distinguished only with the greatest of difficulty when the background population risk is of a similar order of magnitude. As for the autosomes, no convincing case exists for any increased risk for aneuploidy in the children of men with 47,XYY.<br />To our knowledge, there is no report of a discernibly increased risk for the XYY male to have chromosomally abnormal children. A slight increase in gonosomal imbalances in sperm (Table 12-1) might nevertheless lead some to choose prenatal diagnosis.}}</ref><ref name=\"Gardner 2012\">{{cite book|author1=Gardner, R.J.

For some, the urge to violence may be inborn\u2014traced to something called the Y chromosome...<br />Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.<br />Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the \"supermale.\" He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...<br />We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.<br /><br />''Syndrome Status for the XYY''<br />The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.<br />On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.</blockquote></ref>\n\nIn April 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014using Telfer as a main source\u2014introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in [[Paris]]<ref name=\"Daniel Hugon\">Daniel Hugon, Paris, France\n* {{cite news |author=Garrison, Lloyd |date=October 15, 1968 |title=French murder jury rejects chromosome defect as defense |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/15/archives/french-murder-jury-rejects-chromosome-defect-as-defense.html}}\n* {{cite magazine |author=. |date=October 25, 1968 |title=Criminal law: Question of Y |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=92 |issue=17 |page=76 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900408,00.html}}</ref> and [[Melbourne]]<ref name=\"Lawrence Hannell\">Lawrence Hannell, Melbourne, Australia\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Extra chromosome brings acquittal on murder charge |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/10/archives/extra-chromosome-brings-an-acquittal-on-murder-charge.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Auerbach, Stuart |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is basis for acquittal |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185091562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}}\n* {{cite news |author=Getze, George |date=February 3, 1969 |title=Australia precedent for XYY syndrome case held dubious |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/673351452.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}} An Australian murder case that was reported to have been decided on the basis of the so-called XYY syndrome actually was not concerned with chromosome counts at all.</ref>\u2014and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction.<ref name=\"Green 1985\"/><ref name=\"Lyons 1968\">{{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 21, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is linked to crime; Genetics linked to violent crimes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/21/archives/genetic-abnormality-is-linked-to-crime-genetics-linked-to-violent.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 22, 1968 |title=Ultimate Speck appeal may cite a genetic defect |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=43 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/22/archives/ultimate-speck-appeal-may-cite-a-genetic-defect.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Chromosome test for flaws costly; 2 scientists cite scarcity of skilled aides for analyses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/chromosome-test-for-flaws-costly-2-scientists-cite-scarcity-of.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=editorial |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Nature or nurture? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/nature-or-nurture.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Geneticist: Didn't test Speck |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=8}}<blockquote>Dr. Pergament said he and Dr. Sato, a research fellow, had absolutely no connection with the Speck case and never examined Speck.

However, FISH analyses of sperm, enabling hundreds of cells to be analyzed, have shown a very small increased faction of 24,YY spermatozoa in the ejaculate of XYY men (Table 12-1). Thus it appears the vast majority of spermatocytes lose the extra Y before entering meiosis, a very few XYY primary spermatocytes are able to slip through and produce YY (and XY) spermatozoa. These cytogenetic findings parallel the observation that XYY men have no ''discernible'' increase in risk to have children with a sex chromosome abnormality. A true increased risk of a fraction of a per cent could be distinguished only with the greatest of difficulty when the background population risk is of a similar order of magnitude. As for the autosomes, no convincing case exists for any increased risk for aneuploidy in the children of men with 47,XYY.<br />To our knowledge, there is no report of a discernibly increased risk for the XYY male to have chromosomally abnormal children.

For some, the urge to violence may be inborn\u2014traced to something called the Y chromosome...<br />Once in every 500 male births, for example, the sex chromosome complement is XXY rather than XY, thus erring in the direction of femaleness. The resulting individual, called a Klinefelter male, is usually retarded, unusually tall and sterile.<br />Erring in the other direction, however, is the XYY complement resulting in the \"supermale.\" He is also unusually tall and somewhat retarded, but appears to be highly, perhaps too highly, sexually motivated...<br />We were intrigued by Dr. Jacobs' contention that an extra Y chromosome results in tall stature, mild mental retardation, and severely disordered personality characterized by violent, aggressive behavior. We therefore planned to confirm and extend her studies.<br /><br />''Syndrome Status for the XYY''<br />The XXY male has long been thought to display a constellation of symptoms that makes him diagnosable; that is, he has achieved syndrome status. It would seem that the XYY male is fast achieving similar status. His symptoms, as we and other laboratories tend to think of them, are: extremely tall stature, long limbs and strikingly long arm span, facial acne, mild mental retardation, severe mental illness (including psychosis) and aggressive, antisocial behavior with a long history of arrests, frequently beginning at an early age.<br />On reading newspaper accounts of Richard Speck, who murdered eight Chicago student nurses in 1966, we noted all these traits and therefore concluded that Speck was a likely candidate for the XYY disorder. Independently, a cytogenetic laboratory in Chicago confirmed this hunch, reinforcing our inclination to believe that the XYY syndrome is really coming of age. It seems quite possible that in the XYY male, exemplified by Speck, biologists are describing in genetic terms a certain type of defective criminal who has long been explicitly recognized by the forensic psychiatrist.</blockquote></ref>\n\nIn April 1968, ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014using Telfer as a main source\u2014introduced the XYY genetic condition to the general public in a three-part series on consecutive days that began with a Sunday front-page story about the planned use of the condition as a mitigating factor in two murder trials in [[Paris]]<ref name=\"Daniel Hugon\">Daniel Hugon, Paris, France\n* {{cite news |author=Garrison, Lloyd |date=October 15, 1968 |title=French murder jury rejects chromosome defect as defense |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=5 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/15/archives/french-murder-jury-rejects-chromosome-defect-as-defense.html}}\n* {{cite magazine |author=. |date=October 25, 1968 |title=Criminal law: Question of Y |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |volume=92 |issue=17 |page=76 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900408,00.html}}</ref> and [[Melbourne]]<ref name=\"Lawrence Hannell\">Lawrence Hannell, Melbourne, Australia\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Extra chromosome brings acquittal on murder charge |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=94 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/10/10/archives/extra-chromosome-brings-an-acquittal-on-murder-charge.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Auerbach, Stuart |date=October 10, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is basis for acquittal |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/185091562.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}}\n* {{cite news |author=Getze, George |date=February 3, 1969 |title=Australia precedent for XYY syndrome case held dubious |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=C1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/673351452.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI}} An Australian murder case that was reported to have been decided on the basis of the so-called XYY syndrome actually was not concerned with chromosome counts at all.</ref>\u2014and falsely reported that Richard Speck was an XYY male and that the condition would be used in an appeal of his murder conviction.<ref name=\"Green 1985\"/><ref name=\"Lyons 1968\">{{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 21, 1968 |title=Genetic abnormality is linked to crime; Genetics linked to violent crimes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=1 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/21/archives/genetic-abnormality-is-linked-to-crime-genetics-linked-to-violent.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 22, 1968 |title=Ultimate Speck appeal may cite a genetic defect |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=43 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/22/archives/ultimate-speck-appeal-may-cite-a-genetic-defect.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=Lyons, Richard D. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Chromosome test for flaws costly; 2 scientists cite scarcity of skilled aides for analyses |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/chromosome-test-for-flaws-costly-2-scientists-cite-scarcity-of.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=editorial |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Nature or nurture? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |page=46 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/23/archives/nature-or-nurture.html}}\n* {{cite news |author=. |date=April 23, 1968 |title=Geneticist: Didn't test Speck |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |page=8}}<blockquote>Dr. Pergament said he and Dr. Sato, a research fellow, had absolutely no connection with the Speck case and never examined Speck.

From an epidemiological point of view, I would have preferred to have done 80,000... Why did we stop? Well, in the first place there was the informed consent problem.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\nKTE was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as GY in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as ET in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so probably it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as [[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]] in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as RTM in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localised extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* GOC: ICF Rajdhani livery but red replaced by green.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''D'''iesel (D), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''2'''nd generation (2). A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s. The '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name = \"interactive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html |title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive |author=Sheeju Chandran |date= |work= |publisher = Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate = April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n== Orgins ==\nThe WDM-2 history begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be manufactured in India. General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement so the ALCo prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].\n\n== Production History ==\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. The first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many BG countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few subclasses were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by Diesel Loco Modernization Works (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram DBR's.\n\nKTE was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as GY in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as ET in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so probably it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as [[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]] in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as RTM in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\n== Service History ==\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localised extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]] and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* GOC: ICF Rajdhani livery but red replaced by green.

It was released on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]] on April 3, 2020. It also released alongside an [[online multiplayer]] game, ''[[Resident Evil: Resistance]]''.\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its graphics, presentation, [[LGBT]] themes, female protagonist and gameplay. It was criticized for its short length, pacing, and absence of elements from the original game. The game shipped over two million copies within a month.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Resident Evil 3'' is a remake of ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', a [[survival horror]] video game released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 1999, followed by releases for Microsoft Windows and [[Dreamcast|Sega Dreamcast]] in 2000, and [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] in 2003. Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a nightmare, and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters the players assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]], but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is killed by Carlos shortly afterwards. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and communicate via video with Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by an unknown contractor to sabotage Umbrella's efforts to hide their involvement and to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Jill then uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for sabotaging Umbrella. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai for Jill to shoot.{{efn|If missed or not shot, Nicholai kills Jill and Carlos.<ref name=\"IGNdetails\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/21-brilliant-details-in-resident-evil-3|title=21 Brilliant Little Details in Resident Evil 3|website=IGN|date=3 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>}} When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its

Unlike the original, which uses [[tank controls]] and fixed camera angles, the remake features [[third-person shooter]] gameplay similar to the [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|2019 ''Resident Evil 2'' remake]]. {{anchor|Resident Evil: Resistance}}It includes an [[online multiplayer]] mode, ''Resident Evil: Resistance'', which puts a team of four players against a \"mastermind\" who can create traps, enemies, and other hazards.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakeling |first1=Richard |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake Official Release Date On Consoles And PC Announced; RE Resistance Multiplayer Included |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |website=GameSpot |accessdate=12 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212111645/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-3-remake-official-release-date-on-co/1100-6472063/ |archive-date=December 12, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The beginning of ''Resident Evil 3'' however, has players briefly controlling Jill in a [[first person perspective]], in a nightmare, and then in her apartment, engaging with the environment around her much like the characters the players assume the role of in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>https://www.gamerevolution.com/guides/641723-resident-evil-3-remake-first-person-mode-pc-ps4-xbox-one</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Raccoon City]] is thrown into chaos by a [[zombie apocalypse]] caused by an outbreak of the [[T-Virus]]. On September 28, 1998, former Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) member [[Jill Valentine]] is attacked in her apartment by an intelligent [[Biological agent|bioweapon]] known as [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|Nemesis-T Type]], who attempts to kill her and all remaining members of S.T.A.R.S.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Micah |title=Resident Evil 3 Remake: Clues For An Expanded Story |url=https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |website=Game Rant |accessdate=December 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211231255/https://gamerant.com/resident-evil-3-remake-story-clues/ |archive-date=December 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Upon escaping her building, she meets up with fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer [[Brad Vickers]], but Brad is bitten by a zombie and tells Jill to save herself. After another encounter with Nemesis, she is saved by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service (U.B.C.S.) mercenary [[Carlos Oliveira (Resident Evil)|Carlos Oliveira]]. Carlos and his group of surviving U.B.C.S. mercenaries - [[Mikhail Victor]], Tyrell Patrick, and [[Nicholai Ginovaef]] - have set up subway trains which they plan to use to evacuate surviving civilians from the city. \n\nAfter surviving several encounters with Nemesis, Jill manages to reactivate power to the subway, while Carlos and Tyrell remain in the city to search for Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella scientist who might know how to make a vaccine for the T-virus and save the city. As Jill, Nicholai, and Mikhail depart in the train, Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai on how their platoon was ambushed by zombies. Nemesis suddenly attacks the train and kills the civilians; Nicholai locks the other two out, forcing them to defend themselves. Nemesis grabs Mikhail, who sacrifices himself by detonating an explosive, causing the train to derail. Jill escapes as seemingly the only survivor of the crash.\n\nCarlos and Tyrell travel to the city's police department, where they plan to find Bard in the S.T.A.R.S. office. The two witness R.P.D. Lieutenant Marvin Branagh be bitten by a zombified Brad, who is killed by Carlos shortly afterwards. The two enter the S.T.A.R.S. office and communicate via video with Bard, who informs them that he is at a hospital. Meanwhile, as Tyrell traces Bard\u2019s location, Jill escapes the wreckage of the derailed train only to be again pursued by Nemesis who is now heavily mutated. Jill radios Carlos and engages the monster, managing to escape it, but only after it infects her with the T-virus. Jill falls unconscious and Carlos finds her roughly half a day later, taking her to Spencer Memorial Hospital - the location of Bard. Carlos fights his way through the infested hospital only to find that Bard has been murdered. He views a video from Bard confessing that the T-virus was engineered by Umbrella, and despite Umbrella hiring him to develop the vaccine, Umbrella's board now wants to destroy it and eliminate all traces of the virus' existence. Carlos retrieves the vaccine and administers it to Jill. Tyrell arrives at the hospital and they realize that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-Virus infestation. Carlos travels to the NEST 2 lab underneath the hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to try and stop the missile strike.\n\nJill awakens on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and pursues Carlos to NEST 2. She encounters Nicholai, who is revealed to be a supervisor hired by an unknown contractor to sabotage Umbrella's efforts to hide their involvement and to observe and collect data from attacks of several bioweapons, including Nemesis. Nemesis kills Tyrell and continues to pursue Jill throughout the lab. Jill manages to synthesize a vaccine, but an encounter with Nemesis causes Nicholai to retrieve it for himself as he leaves her to fight the monster. Jill attempts to destroy Nemesis in a vat of solution designed to dispose of any biological waste only for Nemesis to further mutate into a giant mass of flesh with tentacles. Jill then uses a prototype [[railgun]] to finally eliminate Nemesis for good. At the hospital's roof deck, Nicholai disarms Jill and destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that he doesn't care for the city's fate as long as he gets paid for sabotaging Umbrella. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai for Jill to shoot.{{efn|If missed or not shot, Nicholai kills Jill and Carlos.<ref name=\"IGNdetails\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/21-brilliant-details-in-resident-evil-3|title=21 Brilliant Little Details in Resident Evil 3|website=IGN|date=3 April 2020|accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref>}} When interrogated on who he works for, he says that he will tell her and pay her anything if he survives. Disgusted by his greed, Jill retrieves the destroyed vaccine case and escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving Nicholai for dead. The city is destroyed by the missile strike, and Jill promises to take down Umbrella.\n\n==Development==\n''Resident Evil 3'' was under development for approximately three years prior to its

According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be \"the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]\".<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices.<ref name=raff1>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016}}</ref> There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as \"search neutrality\" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.<ref name=\"raff1\" />\n\nIn contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as \"what is search neutrality?\" or \"what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?\", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality.<ref name=grimmelmann>{{cite journal|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|journal=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435\u2013461|ssrn = 1742444}}</ref> Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). \"Relevance\" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.\n\nSearch neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of [[search engine bias|search bias]] by other companies.<ref name=\"jolt.law.harvard.edu\">{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title=\"Neutral\" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law & Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1\u201312|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.

A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the \"best\" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the \"biased\" or \"subjective\" results to fit their needs.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry \"foul play,\" but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n\n==Related issues==\n\nAccording to the [[Net Neutrality Institute]], as of 2018, [[Google]]\u2019s \"[[Google Search|Universal Search]]\" system<ref>{{cite web|title=Google 2.0: Google Universal Search|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-20-google-universal-search-11232|work=Search Engine Land|publisher=Third Door Media, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Danny Sullivan|date=16 May 2007}}</ref> uses, by far  the least neutral search engine practices,{{according to whom|date=November 2011}} and following the implementation of Universal Search websites, such as [[MapQuest]], the company experienced a massive decline in web traffic. This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/universalsearch_20070516.html | title=Google Begins Move to Universal Search | date=May 17, 2007| accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://searchengineland.com/google-maps-gaining-on-market-leader-mapquest-13103 | title=Google Maps Gaining On Market Leader Mapquest | publisher=Search Engine Land | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref> Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not.

Indeed, in December 2009 the New York Times published an opinion letter by Foundem co-founder and lead complainant in an anti-trust complaint against Google, Adam Raff, which likely brought the term to the broader public. According to Raff in his opinion letter, search neutrality ought to be \"the [[principle]] that [[search engines]] should have no editorial policies other than that their results be comprehensive, [[impartial]] and based solely on [[relevance]]\".<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>  On October 11, 2009, Adam and his wife Shivaun launched SearchNeutrality.org, an initiative dedicated to promoting investigations against Google's search engine practices.<ref name=raff1>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|website=searchneutrality.org|title=About SearchNeutrality.org|accessdate=4 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804021604/http://www.searchneutrality.org/about|archivedate=4 August 2016}}</ref> There, the Raffs note that they chose to frame their issue with Google as \"search neutrality\" in order to benefit from the focus and interest on net neutrality.<ref name=\"raff1\" />\n\nIn contrast to net neutrality, answers to such questions, as \"what is search neutrality?\" or \"what are appropriate legislative or regulatory principles to protect search neutrality?\", appear to have less consensus. The idea that neutrality means equal treatment, regardless of the content, comes from debates on net neutrality.<ref name=grimmelmann>{{cite journal|title=Some Skepticism about Search Neutrality|journal=The Next Digital Decade: Essays on the Future of the Internet|last1=Grimmelmann|first1=James|pages=435\u2013461|ssrn = 1742444}}</ref> Neutrality in search is complicated by the fact that search engines, by design and in implementation, are not intended to be neutral or impartial. Rather, search engines and other [[information retrieval]] applications are designed to collect and store information (indexing), receive a query from a user, search for and filter relevant information based on that query (searching/filtering), and then present the user with only a subset of those results, which are ranked from most relevant to least relevant (ranking). \"Relevance\" is a form of bias used to favor some results and rank those favored results. Relevance is defined in the search engine so that a user is satisfied with the results and is therefore subject to the user's preferences. And because relevance is so subjective, putting search neutrality into practice has been so contentious.\n\nSearch neutrality became a concern after [[search engines]], most notably [[Google]], were accused of [[search engine bias|search bias]] by other companies.<ref name=\"jolt.law.harvard.edu\">{{cite journal|last1=Lao|first1=Marina|title=\"Neutral\" Search As A Basis for Antitrust Action?|journal=Harvard Journal of Law & Technology Occasional Paper Series|date=July 2013|pages=1\u201312|url=http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/antitrust/articles/Lao.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> Competitors and companies claim search engines systematically favor some sites (and some kind of sites) over others in their lists of results, disrupting the objective results users believe they are getting.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Herman|first1=Tavani|editor1-last=Zalta|editor1-first=Edward N.|title=Search Engines and Ethics|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2014|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/ethics-search/|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe call for search neutrality goes beyond traditional search engines.

The use of search engines to access information through the web has become a key factor for [[online business]]es, which depend on the flow of users visiting their pages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marketingtoday.com/emarketing/0305/b2b_importance_sem.htm| title=Search Engine Marketing | publisher=Marketing Today | year=2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2011}}</ref> One of these companies is Foundem.

At the time at which Foundem claims the penalties were imposed, it was unclear whether web crawlers crawled beyond the main page of a website using iframe tags without some extra modifications. The former SEO director OMD UK, Jaamit Durrani, among others, offered this alternative explanation, stating that \u201cTwo of the major issues that Foundem had in summer was content in iFrames and content requiring javascript to load \u2013 both of which I looked at in August, and they were definitely in place. Both are huge barriers to search visibility in my book. They have been fixed somewhere between then and the lifting of the supposed \u2018penalty\u2019.

A biased view of the Internet is exactly what search users are seeking. By performing a search the user is seeking what that search engine perceives as the \"best\" result to their query. Enforced search neutrality would, essentially, remove this bias. Users continually return to a specific search engine because they find the \"biased\" or \"subjective\" results to fit their needs.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Search neutrality has the possibility of causing search engines to become stagnant. If site A is first on a [[Search engine results page|SERP]] (search engine results page) one month, and then tenth the next month search neutrality advocates cry \"foul play,\" but in reality it is often the page's loss in popularity, relevance, or quality content that has caused the move. The case against Google brought forth by the owners of Foundem extoll this phenomenon and regulation could limit the search engine's ability to adjust ranking based on their own metrics.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Proponents of search neutrality desire transparency in a search engine's ranking algorithm. Requiring transparent algorithms leads to two concerns. These algorithms are the companies private [[intellectual property]] and should not be forced into the open. This would be similar to forcing a soda manufacturer to publish their recipes. The second concern is that opening the algorithm would allow spammers to exploit and target how the algorithm functions directly. This would permit spammers to circumvent the metrics in place that prevent spammed websites from being at the top of a SERP.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n*Removing a search engine's ability to directly manipulate rankings limits their ability to penalize dishonest websites that practice [[Black hat hacking|black hat]] techniques to improve their rankings. Any site who finds a way to circumvent the algorithm would benefit from a search engine's inability to manually decrease their ranking causing a spam site to gain high ranking for extended periods of time.<ref name=\"Grimmelmann\" />\n\n==Related issues==\n\nAccording [[Net Neutrality Institute]] as of 2018, [[Google]]\u2019s \"[[Google Search|Universal Search]]\" system<ref>{{cite web|title=Google 2.0: Google Universal Search|url=http://searchengineland.com/google-20-google-universal-search-11232|work=Search Engine Land|publisher=Third Door Media, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2012|author=Danny Sullivan|date=16 May 2007}}</ref> uses, by far  the least neutral search engine practices,{{according to whom|date=November 2011}} and following the implementation of Universal Search websites, such as [[MapQuest]], the company experienced a massive decline in web traffic. This decline has been attributed to Google linking to its own services rather than the services offered at external websites.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/universalsearch_20070516.html | title=Google Begins Move to Universal Search | date=May 17, 2007| accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://searchengineland.com/google-maps-gaining-on-market-leader-mapquest-13103 | title=Google Maps Gaining On Market Leader Mapquest | publisher=Search Engine Land | date=January 10, 2008 | accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref> Despite these claims, Google actually displays Google content on the first page, while rival search engines do not considerably less often than Microsoft's Bing which displays Microsoft content when rivals do not.

The assassination set in motion two of the bloodiest events of the late 20th century: the [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[First Congo War]].\n\nResponsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the [[Tutsi]] rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) or government-aligned [[Hutu Power]] followers opposed to negotiation with the RPF. Within hours of the attack, the mass slaughter of Tutsi people began, resulting in the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in the following three months.\n\n== Background  ==\nIn 1990, the [[Rwandan Civil War]] began when the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], dominated by the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group, invaded northern Rwanda from [[Uganda]]. Most of the RPF fighters were either [[refugee]]s or the sons of refugees who had fled ethnic purges by the Hutu government in the middle of the century. The attempt to overthrow the government failed, though the RPF was able to maintain control of a border region.<ref>Mamdani, p. 186</ref> As it became clear that the war had reached a stalemate, the sides began peace negotiations in May 1992, which resulted in the signing in August 1993 of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] to create a power-sharing government.<ref>Melvern, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nThe war radicalized the internal opposition. The RPF's show of force intensified support for the so-called \"[[Hutu Power]]\" ideology. Hutu Power portrayed the RPF as an alien force intent on reinstating the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] and enslaving the Hutus:  a prospect which must be resisted at all costs.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 189\u2013191</ref> This ideology was embraced most wholeheartedly by the [[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]] (CDR) who advocated racist principles known as the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]]. This political force led to the collapse of the first Habyarimana government in July 1993, when Prime Minister [[Dismas Nsengiyaremye]] criticized the president in writing for delaying a peace agreement. Habyarimana, a member of the [[Mouvement r\u00e9publicain national pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le d\u00e9veloppement|MRND]] political party, dismissed Nsengiyarmye and appointed [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]], who was perceived to be less sympathetic to the RPF, in his stead. The main opposition parties refused to support Madame Agathe's appointment, each splitting into two factions: one calling for the unwavering defense of Hutu Power and the other, labeled \"moderate\", that sought a negotiated settlement to the war. As Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was unable to form a coalition government, ratification of the Arusha Accords was impossible. The most extreme of the Hutu parties, the CDR, which openly called for [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Tutsi, was entirely unrepresented in the Accords.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] in 1980]]\n\nThe security situation deteriorated throughout 1993. Armed Hutu militias attacked Tutsis throughout the country, while high-ranking adherents of Hutu Power began to consider how the security forces might be turned to [[genocide]].<ref>Melvern, pp. 45\u201346</ref> In February 1994, [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], the head of the military force attached to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), which had been sent to observe the implementation of the Arusha Accords, informed his superiors, \"Time does seem to be running out for political discussions, as any spark on the security side could have catastrophic consequences.\"<ref name=independent>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable \"Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416080402/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable |date=16 April 2006 }}, [[United Nations]] (hosted by ess.uwe.ac.uk).

Despite a classified February [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analysis predicting half a million deaths if the Arusha process failed,<ref>Melvern, p. 128</ref> the U.S. was attempting to reduce its international commitments in the wake of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Somalia debacle]] and lobbied to end the mission. A compromise extending UNAMIR's mandate for three more months was finally reached on the evening of Tuesday, the fifth of April. Meanwhile, Habyarimana was finishing regional travel. On 4 April, he had flown to [[Zaire]] to meet with president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and on the sixth flew to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] for a one-day regional summit for heads of state convened by Tanzania's President.<ref>Melvern, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> On the return trip that evening he was joined by Burundian president [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], and a couple of his ministers, who preferred the faster [[Dassault Falcon 50]] that the French government had given to Habyarimana over Ntaryamira's own presidential plane.<ref>Melvern, p. 142</ref>\n\nAccording to interim Prime Minister [[Jean Kambanda]]'s testimony to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of neighboring [[Zaire]] (now DRC) had warned Habyarimana not to go to Dar es Salaam on 6 April. Mobutu reportedly said this warning had come from a very senior official in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. There was a link between this warning, said Mobutu, and the subsequent suicide in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]], a senior high-ranking official who was working for President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and who killed himself on 7 April after learning about the downing of the Falcon.<ref>Melvern, Linda: \"[http://www.lindamelvern.com/articles/120-expert-refutes-bruguiere-claims-that-rpf-shot-down-rwandan-presidents-aircraft-in-1994 Expert Refutes Brugui\u00e8re Claims that RPF Shot Down Rwandan President's Aircraft in 1994.]\" ''The New Times.'' 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\n== Missile attack ==\n\nShortly before 8:20&nbsp;pm local time (18:20&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the presidential jet circled once around [[Kigali International Airport]] before coming in for [[Final approach (aviation)|final approach]] in clear skies.<ref name=Melvern133>Melvern, p. 133</ref> A weekly flight by a Belgian [[C-130 Hercules]] carrying UNAMIR troops returning from leave had been scheduled to land before the presidential jet, but was waved off to give the president priority.<ref name=Dallaire228>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 228</ref>\n\nA [[surface-to-air missile]] struck one of the wings of the Dassault Falcon, then a second missile hit its tail.

One of two Belgian officers in the garden of a house in [[Kicukiro District#Sectors|Kanombe]], the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red flash in the sky and heard an aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]], who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport [[control tower]] saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.<ref>Melvern, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nA Rwandan soldier in the military camp in Kanombe recalled,\n<blockquote>You know, its engine sound was different from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I was the leader of the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them \"Get up because Kinani ''[a [[Kinyarwanda]] nickname for Habyarimana meaning \"famous\" or \"invincible\"]'' has been shot down.' They told me, \"You are lying.\" I said, \"It's true.\" So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.<ref name=Melvern135>Melvern, p. 135</ref></blockquote>\n\nA Rwandan officer cadet at the airport who was listening to the [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] heard the announcer state that the presidential jet was coming in to land. The spoken broadcast stopped suddenly in favor of a selection of [[classical music]].<ref name=Melvern134>Melvern, p. 134</ref>\n\n=== Victims ===\nAll twelve aboard the Falcon were killed.

Presidential Guards, who had been waiting to escort the president home from the airport, threatened people with their weapons. Twenty Belgian peacekeepers who had been stationed along the perimeter of the airport were surrounded by the Presidential Guard and some were disarmed.<ref name=Melvern134/> The airport was closed and the circling Belgian Hercules was diverted to [[Nairobi]].<ref name=Dallaire228/>\n\nIn Camp Kanombe, the bugle call immediately after the crash was taken by soldiers to mean that the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] had attacked the camp. The soldiers rushed to their units' armories to equip themselves. Soldiers of the paracommando brigade [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]] assembled on the parade ground at around 9:00&nbsp;pm while members of other units gathered elsewhere in the camp.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\">Melvern, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> At least one witness stated that about an hour after the crash there was the sound of gunfire in Kanombe. Munitions explosions at Camp Kanombe were also initially reported.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe senior officer for the Kigali operational zone called the Ministry of Defence with the news. Defence Minister [[Augustin Bizimana]] was out of the country, and the officer who took the call failed to reach Col. [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]], the director of the office of the minister of defence, who was apparently at a reception given by UNAMIR's [[Bangladesh]]i officers.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe news of the crash, initially reported as an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali sector commander [[Luc Marchal]] to send a patrol to the crash site.<ref name=Dallaire221>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 221</ref> Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] and [[Lando Ndasingwa]]. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that she was trying to gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported that all of the hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head [[Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh]] to inform him of developments.

News arrived that Major-General [[D\u00e9ogratias Nsabimana]], the army chief of staff, had been on the plane.

The RPF invaded, eventually capturing the country and installing a new government. About 1.2&nbsp;million [[refugee]]s fled to neighboring countries, partially due to fear of RPF retribution and partially due to a plan by the Hutu extremists to use the refugee camps as military bases for the reconquest of Rwanda. The [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]] thus became increasingly politicized and militarized until the RPF supported a rebel attack against the refugee camps across the border in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1996. The rebel [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] continued their offensive, in the [[First Congo War]], until they overthrew the government of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]. In 1998, the new Congolese president, [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]], had a falling out with his foreign backers, who began another rebellion to put a more amenable government into place. The resulting [[Second Congo War]] (1998\u20132003) drew in eight nations and became the deadliest conflict since [[World War II]], killing an estimated 3.8&nbsp;million people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe [[Burundi Civil War]] continued after the death of Ntaryamira, both being sustained by and feeding into the instability in Rwanda and the Congo. Over 300,000 people died before a government of national unity was established in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAt some point following the 6 April assassination, Juvenal Habyarimana's remains were obtained by Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and stored in a private mausoleum in [[Gbadolite]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Mobutu promised Habyarimana's family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On 12 May 1997, as [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]]'s [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|ADFL]] rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to [[Kinshasa]] where they waited on the tarmac of [[N'djili Airport]] for three days. On 16 May, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire, Habyarimana's remains were cremated under the supervision of an Indian [[Hindu]] leader.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/world/ending-a-chapter-mobutu-cremates-rwanda-ally.html Ending a Chapter, Mobutu Cremates Rwanda Ally] by Howard W.

The assassination set in motion two of the bloodiest events of the late 20th century: the [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[First Congo War]].\n\nResponsibility for the attack is disputed, with most theories proposing as suspects either the [[Tutsi]] rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) or government-aligned [[Hutu Power]] followers opposed to negotiation with the RPF. Within hours of the attack, the mass slaughter of Tutsi people began, resulting in the genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsi in the following three months.\n\n== Background  ==\nIn 1990, the [[Rwandan Civil War]] began when the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]], dominated by the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group, invaded northern Rwanda from [[Uganda]]. Most of the RPF fighters were either [[refugee]]s or the sons of refugees who had fled ethnic purges by the Hutu government in the middle of the century. The attempt to overthrow the government failed, though the RPF was able to maintain control of a border region.<ref>Mamdani, p. 186</ref> As it became clear that the war had reached a stalemate, the sides began peace negotiations in May 1992, which resulted in the signing in August 1993 of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] to create a power-sharing government.<ref>Melvern, pp. 36\u201337</ref>\n\nThe war radicalized the internal opposition. The RPF's show of force intensified support for the so-called \"[[Hutu Power]]\" ideology. Hutu Power portrayed the RPF as an alien force intent on reinstating the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] and enslaving the Hutus:  a prospect which must be resisted at all costs.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 189\u2013191</ref> This ideology was embraced most wholeheartedly by the [[Coalition for the Defense of the Republic]] (CDR) who advocated racist principles known as the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]]. This political force led to the collapse of the first Habyarimana government in July 1993, when Prime Minister [[Dismas Nsengiyaremye]] criticized the president in writing for delaying a peace agreement. Habyarimana, a member of the [[Mouvement r\u00e9publicain national pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le d\u00e9veloppement|MRND]] political party, dismissed Nsengiyarmye and appointed [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]], who was perceived to be less sympathetic to the RPF, in his stead. The main opposition parties refused to support Madame Agathe's appointment, each splitting into two factions: one calling for the unwavering defense of Hutu Power and the other, labeled \"moderate\", that sought a negotiated settlement to the war. As Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana was unable to form a coalition government, ratification of the Arusha Accords was impossible. The most extreme of the Hutu parties, the CDR, which openly called for [[ethnic cleansing]] of the Tutsi, was entirely unrepresented in the Accords.<ref>Mamdani, pp. 211\u2013212</ref>\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] in 1980]]\n\nThe security situation deteriorated throughout 1993. Armed Hutu militias attacked Tutsis throughout the country, while high-ranking adherents of Hutu Power began to consider how the security forces might be turned to [[genocide]].<ref>Melvern, pp. 45\u201346</ref> In February 1994, [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]], the head of the military force attached to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), which had been sent to observe the implementation of the Arusha Accords, informed his superiors, \"Time does seem to be running out for political discussions, as any spark on the security side could have catastrophic consequences.\"<ref name=independent>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable \"Report of the Independent Inquiry into the Actions of the UN during the 1994 Genocide in Rwanda\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060416080402/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/documents/RwandaReport3.htm#January%20Cable |date=16 April 2006 }}, [[United Nations]] (hosted by ess.uwe.ac.uk).

Despite a classified February [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) analysis predicting half a million deaths if the Arusha process failed,<ref>Melvern, p. 128</ref> the U.S. was attempting to reduce its international commitments in the wake of the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Somalia debacle]] and lobbied to end the mission. A compromise extending UNAMIR's mandate for three more months was finally reached on the evening of Tuesday, the fifth of April. Meanwhile, Habyarimana was finishing regional travel. On 4 April, he had flown to [[Zaire]] to meet with president [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and on the sixth flew to [[Dar es Salaam]], [[Tanzania]] for a one-day regional summit for heads of state convened by Tanzania's President.<ref>Melvern, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> On the return trip that evening he was joined by Burundian president [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]], and a couple of his ministers, who preferred the faster [[Dassault Falcon 50]] that the French government had given to Habyarimana over Ntaryamira's own presidential plane.<ref>Melvern, p. 142</ref>\n\nAccording to interim Prime Minister [[Jean Kambanda]]'s testimony to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR), President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] of neighboring [[Zaire]] (now DRC) had warned Habyarimana not to go to Dar es Salaam on 6 April. Mobutu reportedly said this warning had come from a very senior official in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in Paris. There was a link between this warning, said Mobutu, and the subsequent suicide in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e of [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]], a senior high-ranking official who was working for President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] and who killed himself on 7 April after learning about the downing of the Falcon.<ref>Melvern, Linda: \"[http://www.lindamelvern.com/articles/120-expert-refutes-bruguiere-claims-that-rpf-shot-down-rwandan-presidents-aircraft-in-1994 Expert Refutes Brugui\u00e8re Claims that RPF Shot Down Rwandan President's Aircraft in 1994.]\" ''The New Times.'' 27 November 2006.</ref>\n\n== Missile attack ==\n\nShortly before 8:20&nbsp;pm local time (18:20&nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), the presidential jet circled once around [[Kigali International Airport]] before coming in for [[Final approach (aviation)|final approach]] in clear skies.<ref name=Melvern133>Melvern, p. 133</ref> A weekly flight by a Belgian [[C-130 Hercules]] carrying UNAMIR troops returning from leave had been scheduled to land before the presidential jet, but was waved off to give the president priority.<ref name=Dallaire228>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 228</ref>\n\nA [[surface-to-air missile]] struck one of the wings of the Dassault Falcon, then a second missile hit its tail.

One of two Belgian officers in the garden of a house in [[Kicukiro District#Sectors|Kanombe]], the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red flash in the sky and heard an aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]], who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport [[control tower]] saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.<ref>Melvern, pp. 133\u2013134</ref>\n\nA Rwandan soldier in the military camp in Kanombe recalled,\n<blockquote>You know, its engine sound was different from other planes; that is, the president's engine's sound ... We were looking towards where the plane was coming from, and we saw a projectile and we saw a ball of flame or flash and we saw the plane go down; and I saw it. I was the leader of the bloc so I asked the soldiers to get up and I told them \"Get up because Kinani ''[a [[Kinyarwanda]] nickname for Habyarimana meaning \"famous\" or \"invincible\"]'' has been shot down.' They told me, \"You are lying.\" I said, \"It's true.\" So I opened my wardrobe, I put on my uniform and I heard the bugle sound.<ref name=Melvern135>Melvern, p. 135</ref></blockquote>\n\nA Rwandan officer cadet at the airport who was listening to the [[Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines]] heard the announcer state that the presidential jet was coming in to land.

Presidential Guards, who had been waiting to escort the president home from the airport, threatened people with their weapons. Twenty Belgian peacekeepers who had been stationed along the perimeter of the airport were surrounded by the Presidential Guard and some were disarmed.<ref name=Melvern134/> The airport was closed and the circling Belgian Hercules was diverted to [[Nairobi]].<ref name=Dallaire228/>\n\nIn Camp Kanombe, the bugle call immediately after the crash was taken by soldiers to mean that the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] had attacked the camp. The soldiers rushed to their units' armories to equip themselves. Soldiers of the paracommando brigade [[Commando Parachute Group|Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur]] assembled on the parade ground at around 9:00&nbsp;pm while members of other units gathered elsewhere in the camp.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\">Melvern, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> At least one witness stated that about an hour after the crash there was the sound of gunfire in Kanombe. Munitions explosions at Camp Kanombe were also initially reported.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe senior officer for the Kigali operational zone called the Ministry of Defence with the news. Defence Minister [[Augustin Bizimana]] was out of the country, and the officer who took the call failed to reach Col. [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]], the director of the office of the minister of defence, who was apparently at a reception given by UNAMIR's [[Bangladesh]]i officers.<ref name=Melvern134/>\n\nThe news of the crash, initially reported as an explosion of UNAMIR's ammunition dump, was quickly relayed to UNAMIR Force Commander Dallaire. He ordered UNAMIR Kigali sector commander [[Luc Marchal]] to send a patrol to the crash site.<ref name=Dallaire221>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 221</ref> Numerous people began calling UNAMIR seeking information, including Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] and [[Lando Ndasingwa]]. Uwilingiyimana informed Dallaire that she was trying to gather her cabinet but many ministers were afraid to leave their families. She also reported that all of the hardline ministers had disappeared. Dallaire asked the prime minister if she could confirm that it was the president's plane that had crashed, and called UNAMIR political head [[Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh]] to inform him of developments. Uwilingiyimana called back to confirm that it was the president's jet and he was presumed to be on board. She also asked for UNAMIR help in regaining control of the political situation, as she was legally next in the line of succession, but some moderate ministers allied to her had already begun fleeing their homes, fearing for their safety.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, pp. 221\u2013222</ref>\n\nAt 9:18&nbsp;pm, Presidential Guards whom a UNAMIR report described as \"nervous and dangerous\" established a roadblock near the Hotel M\u00e9ridien. Several other roadblocks had been set up prior to the attack as part of security preparations for Habyarimana's arrival.<ref>Melvern, pp. 134\u2013135</ref> The patrol of UNAMIR Belgian soldiers sent to investigate the crash site was stopped at a Presidential Guards roadblock at 9:35&nbsp;pm, disarmed and sent to the airport.<ref name=Melvern135/>\n\nThe para-commando brigade was ordered to collect bodies from the crash site and UN peacekeepers were prevented from accessing the site.<ref name=\"Melvern\">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jan/10/rwanda-at-last-we-know-truth?newsfeed=true | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Linda | last=Melvern | title=Rwanda: at last we know the truth | date=10 January 2012}}</ref> Later, two French soldiers arrived at the crash and asked to be given the [[flight data recorder]] once it was recovered.<ref name=\"Melvern, pp. 135-136\"/> The whereabouts of the flight data recorder were later unknown. French military contacted Dallaire and offered to investigate the crash, which Dallaire refused immediately.<ref name=\"Melvern\"/>\n\nA Rwandan colonel who called the army command about 40 minutes after the crash was told that there was no confirmation that the president was dead. About half an hour later, roughly 9:30, the situation was still confused at army command, though it appeared clear that the presidential aircraft had exploded and that it had probably been hit by a missile. News arrived that Major-General [[D\u00e9ogratias Nsabimana]], the army chief of staff, had been on the plane. The officers present realized that they would have to appoint a new chief of staff in order to clarify the [[chain of command]] and began a meeting to decide whom to appoint. Col. Bagosora joined them soon afterward.<ref>Melvern, p. 136</ref> At about 10:00&nbsp;pm, Ephrem Rwabalinda, the government liaison officer to UNAMIR, called Dallaire to inform him that a crisis committee was about to meet. After informing his superiors in [[New York City]] of the situation, Dallaire went to attend the meeting, where he found Bagosora in charge.<ref>Dallaire & Beardsley, p. 222</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nThe death toll of the Rwandan genocide is commonly estimated at 800,000, though some estimates top one million. The RPF invaded, eventually capturing the country and installing a new government. About 1.2&nbsp;million [[refugee]]s fled to neighboring countries, partially due to fear of RPF retribution and partially due to a plan by the Hutu extremists to use the refugee camps as military bases for the reconquest of Rwanda. The [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]] thus became increasingly politicized and militarized until the RPF supported a rebel attack against the refugee camps across the border in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 1996. The rebel [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] continued their offensive, in the [[First Congo War]], until they overthrew the government of [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]. In 1998, the new Congolese president, [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]], had a falling out with his foreign backers, who began another rebellion to put a more amenable government into place. The resulting [[Second Congo War]] (1998\u20132003) drew in eight nations and became the deadliest conflict since [[World War II]], killing an estimated 3.8&nbsp;million people.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe [[Burundi Civil War]] continued after the death of Ntaryamira, both being sustained by and feeding into the instability in Rwanda and the Congo. Over 300,000 people died before a government of national unity was established in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nAt some point following the 6 April assassination, Juvenal Habyarimana's remains were obtained by Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] and stored in a private mausoleum in [[Gbadolite]], [[Zaire]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]). Mobutu promised Habyarimana's family that his body would eventually be given a proper burial in Rwanda. On 12 May 1997, as [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]]'s [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo|ADFL]] rebels were advancing on Gbadolite, Mobutu had the remains flown by cargo plane to [[Kinshasa]] where they waited on the tarmac of [[N'djili Airport]] for three days. On 16 May, the day before Mobutu fled Zaire, Habyarimana's remains were cremated under the supervision of an Indian [[Hindu]] leader.<ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/world/ending-a-chapter-mobutu-cremates-rwanda-ally.html Ending a Chapter, Mobutu Cremates Rwanda Ally] by Howard W.

All such evidence is heavily disputed and many academics, as well as the [[United Nations]], have refrained from issuing a definitive finding.
