It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. \n\nIts aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.<ref name=\"what_is_cites\">{{cite web|url= http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php |title=What is CITES?|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2018}}, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is [[Ivonne Higuero]].<ref name=\"higuero\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/news/ivonne-higuero-named-as-new-cites-secretary-general_16102018|title=Ivonne Higuero named as new CITES Secretary-General|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background and operation ==\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.  Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties  with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders.<ref name=Zimmerman>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|title=Zimmerman, \"The Black Market for Wildlife: llegal Wildlife Trade,\" ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'' 36 (5) 1657-1689 (November 2003)|accessdate=23 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621160652/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|archivedate=21 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.<ref name=Reeve>Reeve, Policing International Trade in Endangered Species: The CITES Treaty and agreement.  London: Earthscan, 2000.</ref>\n\nFunding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions.  Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.\n\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\n*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat\n*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat\n*A formal warning\n*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity\n*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party<ref name=\"cites_suspend\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php|title=Countries currently subject to a recommendation to suspend trade|publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\n\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and  failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\n\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for [[luxury goods]] such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as [[manta ray]]s or [[pangolin]]s.<ref name=NYT031313>{{cite news|title=No Species Is Safe From Burgeoning Wildlife Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/no-species-is-safe-from-burgeoning-wildlife-trade.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Bettina Wassener}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175px\" caption=\"CITES compliance is complicated by the similarity of some banned species to permitted species, and by the diverse appearance of specimens of the same species\">\nFile:Mahogany wood and 2 close lookalikes, Kew Gardens.jpg|Samples of wood of three species including [[mahogany]], looking similar\nFile:Three Teak samples looking very different.jpg|Three samples of [[teak]] wood from different countries, looking different\n</gallery>\n\n==Ratifications==\n[[File:CITES.svg|thumb|300px|Parties to the treaty. [[Greenland]] is covered by CITES regulations through [[Denmark]].<ref name=DMK/>]]\nThe text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of October 2016, the Convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php|title=List of Contracting Parties - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the [[United Nations]] are party to the treaty, with the exception of [[Andorra]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Haiti]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[South Sudan]], [[East Timor]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tuvalu]]. UN observer the [[Holy See]] is also not a member. The [[Faroe Islands]], an autonomous country in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and [[Greenland]] are part of CITES).<ref name=DMK>[http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/DK CITES: Denmark. Retrieved 24 February 2015.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/FO CITES: Faroe Islands. Retrieved 24 February 2015.]</ref>\n\nAn amendment to the text of the Convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment<ref>{{cite web|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php |publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the [[European Union]], to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the Convention.  The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\n\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment.  At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation of trade==\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.\n\n==Appendices==\n\nRoughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against [[over-exploitation]] through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/index.php|title=The CITES Appendices|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.\n\nSpecies may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another.  Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be 'laundered' through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected.  The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I.  Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II.  Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such 'laundering' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by [[range states]] with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana''), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]]).\n\nSpecies are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 17) in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]  from 24 September to 5 October 2016 at the Sandton Convention Center.<ref name=\"CITES-Calendar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php |title=CITES Calendar |publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing.  These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.\n\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations.  For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection.  Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.<ref name=Hutton>Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Appendix I===\nAppendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII).  The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population.  Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. \n\nNotable animal species listed in Appendix I include the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), the [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]] species (''Pan spp.''), [[tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris'' subspecies), [[Asiatic lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), [[leopards]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), some populations of [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s ([[Sirenia]]), and all [[rhinoceros]] species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\">{{cite web|title=Appendices I, II and III |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Appendix II===\nAppendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild.  In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices.  International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate.  In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually.<ref name=\"CITES-Quotas\">{{cite web|title=CITES Export Quotas |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>  No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures.  A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\"/>\n\nIn addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#VII |title=Article VII: Exemptions and Other Special Provisions Relating to Trade |work=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora |publisher=CITES |accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix II are the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae''), [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana''), [[queen conch]] (''Strombus gigas''), [[Emperor scorpion]] (''Pandinus imperator''), [[Mertens' water monitor]] (''Varanus mertensi''), bigleaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'') and [[lignum vitae]] \"ironwood\" (''Guaiacum officinale'').\n\n===Appendix III===\nAppendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species.  The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally.  In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\" />\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the [[two-toed sloth]]  (''Choloepus hoffmanni'') by Costa Rica, [[sitatunga]] (''Tragelaphus spekii'') by Ghana, [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta'') by Botswana, and [[alligator snapping turtle]] (''Macrochelys temminckii'') by the USA.\n\n==Amendments and reservations==\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting.  The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty.  Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see Reservations entered by Parties CITES<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php|title=Reservations entered by Parties &#124; CITES|website=www.cites.org}}</ref> for current reservations).  Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\n\nNotable reservations include those by [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Norway]] on various [[baleen]] whale species and those on [[Falconiformes]] by Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"CITES-Reservations\">{{cite web|title=CITES Reservations Entered by Parties |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Shortcomings and concerns==\n\n===Approach to biodiversity conservation===\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, [[ecosystem approach]]es to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), although this has been changing (see [[Nile crocodile]], [[African elephant]], South African [[white rhino]] case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand.<ref name=Hill>Hill, 1990, \"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species: Fifteen Years Later,\" ''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Journal'' 13: 231</ref> In fact, CITES listings have been demonstrated to increase financial speculation in certain markets for high value species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhu|first= Annah|year= 2020|title=Restricting trade in endangered species can backfire, triggering market booms|work= The Conversation|url=https://theconversation.com/restricting-trade-in-endangered-species-can-backfire-triggering-market-booms-124869}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1613955|title=China\u2019s Rosewood Boom: A Cultural Fix to Capital Overaccumulation|first=Annah Lake|last=Zhu|date=2 January 2020|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=110|issue=1|pages=277\u2013296|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/24694452.2019.1613955}}</ref> Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\n\n===Drafting===\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"[[negative list]]\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated ''unless'' the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained.  Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review.  For example, recently several bird classified as [[IUCN Red List|threatened with extinction]] appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status.  If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\n\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\n\n===Reform suggestions===\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, [[TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network]] and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting.  CITES would benefit from access to [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.  Development of a future  mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.<ref name=\"Reeve\"/>\n\nOn 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant [[ivory]] from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.\n\n=== [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] Data ===\nFrom 2005 &ndash; 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers\n* 317,000 live birds\n* More than 2 million live reptiles\n* 2.5 million crocodile skins\n* 2.1 million [[Snakeskin|snake skins]]\n* 73 tons of [[caviar]]\n* 1.1 million beaver skins\n* Millions of pieces of [[coral]]\n* 20,000 mammalian [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophies]]\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.<ref>Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''.

The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) was held in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and the one before it (CoP 16) was held in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], in 2013.  The next one (CoP 18) will be in [[Sri Lanka]] in May 2019.  The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\n\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP.  The Committee meetings take place in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Secretariat is administered by [[UNEP]]. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings.  The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the latest one was held in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]] in May 2014.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=90|Meeting\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=1 width=110|City\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=120|Country\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=200|Duration\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 1\n|[[Bern]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 2\u20136 November 1976\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 2\n|[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n| 19\u201330 March 1979\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 3\n|[[New Delhi]]\n|{{flag|India}}\n| 25 February \u2013 8 March 1981\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 4\n|[[Gaborone]]\n|{{flag|Botswana}}\n| 19 \u2013 30 April 1983\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 5\n|[[Buenos Aires]]\n|{{flag|Argentina}}\n| 22 April \u2013 3 May 1985\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 6\n|[[Ottawa]]\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n| 12\u201324 July 1987\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 7\n|[[Lausanne]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 9\u201320 October 1989\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 8\n|[[Kyoto]]\n|{{flag|Japan}}\n| 2\u201313 March 1992\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 9\n|[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]\n|{{flag|United States}}\n| 7\u201318 November 1994\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 10\n|[[Harare]]\n|{{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n| 9\u201320 June 1997\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 11\n|[[Gigiri]]\n|{{flag|Kenya}}\n| 10\u201320 April 2000\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 12\n|[[Santiago]]\n|{{flag|Chile}}\n| 3\u201315 November 2002\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 13\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 2\u201314 October 2004\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 14\n|[[The Hague]]\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n| 3\u201315 June 2007\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 15\n|[[Doha]]\n|{{flag|Qatar}}\n| 13\u201325 March 2010\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 16\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 3\u201314 March 2013\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 17\n|[[Johannesburg]]\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n| 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''CoP 18''\n|[[Geneva]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 17-28 August 2019\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 19\n|[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n| 2022\n|-\n|}\n\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php|title=CITES calendar &#124; CITES|website=www.cites.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n*[[Environmental agreements]]\n*[[IUCN Red List]]\n*[[Ivory trade]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix I]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix II]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix III]]\n*[[Shark finning]]\n*[[Wildlife conservation]]\n*[[Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System]]\n*[[Wildlife management]]\n*[[Wildlife smuggling]]\n*[[World Wildlife Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Oldfield, S. and McGough, N.

Species of Wild Fauna and Flora''', also known as the '''Washington Convention''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. \n\nIts aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.<ref name=\"what_is_cites\">{{cite web|url= http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php |title=What is CITES?|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2018}}, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is [[Ivonne Higuero]].<ref name=\"higuero\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/news/ivonne-higuero-named-as-new-cites-secretary-general_16102018|title=Ivonne Higuero named as new CITES Secretary-General|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=29 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Background and operation ==\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.  Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties  with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders.<ref name=Zimmerman>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|title=Zimmerman, \"The Black Market for Wildlife: llegal Wildlife Trade,\" ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'' 36 (5) 1657-1689 (November 2003)|accessdate=23 March 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621160652/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|archivedate=21 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.<ref name=Reeve>Reeve, Policing International Trade in Endangered Species: The CITES Treaty and agreement.  London: Earthscan, 2000.</ref>\n\nFunding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions.  Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.\n\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\n*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat\n*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat\n*A formal warning\n*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity\n*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party<ref name=\"cites_suspend\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php|title=Countries currently subject to a recommendation to suspend trade|publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\n\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and  failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\n\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for [[luxury goods]] such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as [[manta ray]]s or [[pangolin]]s.<ref name=NYT031313>{{cite news|title=No Species Is Safe From Burgeoning Wildlife Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/no-species-is-safe-from-burgeoning-wildlife-trade.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Bettina Wassener}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175px\" caption=\"CITES compliance is complicated by the similarity of some banned species to permitted species, and by the diverse appearance of specimens of the same species\">\nFile:Mahogany wood and 2 close lookalikes, Kew Gardens.jpg|Samples of wood of three species including [[mahogany]], looking similar\nFile:Three Teak samples looking very different.jpg|Three samples of [[teak]] wood from different countries, looking different\n</gallery>\n\n==Ratifications==\n[[File:CITES.svg|thumb|300px|Parties to the treaty. [[Greenland]] is covered by CITES regulations through [[Denmark]].<ref name=DMK/>]]\nThe text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of October 2016, the Convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php|title=List of Contracting Parties - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the [[United Nations]] are party to the treaty, with the exception of [[Andorra]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Haiti]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[South Sudan]], [[East Timor]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tuvalu]]. UN observer the [[Holy See]] is also not a member. The [[Faroe Islands]], an autonomous country in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and [[Greenland]] are part of CITES).<ref name=DMK>[http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/DK CITES: Denmark. Retrieved 24 February 2015.]</ref><ref>[http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/FO CITES: Faroe Islands. Retrieved 24 February 2015.]</ref>\n\nAn amendment to the text of the Convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment<ref>{{cite web|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php |publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the [[European Union]], to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the Convention.  The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\n\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment.  At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation of trade==\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.\n\n==Appendices==\n\nRoughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against [[over-exploitation]] through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/index.php|title=The CITES Appendices|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.\n\nSpecies may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another.  Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be 'laundered' through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected.  The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I.  Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II.  Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such 'laundering' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by [[range states]] with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana''), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]]).\n\nSpecies are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 17) in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]  from 24 September to 5 October 2016 at the Sandton Convention Center.<ref name=\"CITES-Calendar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php |title=CITES Calendar |publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing.  These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.\n\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations.  For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection.  Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.<ref name=Hutton>Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Appendix I===\nAppendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII).  The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population.  Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. \n\nNotable animal species listed in Appendix I include the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), the [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]] species (''Pan spp.''), [[tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris'' subspecies), [[Asiatic lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), [[leopards]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), some populations of [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s ([[Sirenia]]), and all [[rhinoceros]] species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\">{{cite web|title=Appendices I, II and III |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Appendix II===\nAppendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild.  In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices.  International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate.  In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually.<ref name=\"CITES-Quotas\">{{cite web|title=CITES Export Quotas |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>  No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures.  A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\"/>\n\nIn addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#VII |title=Article VII: Exemptions and Other Special Provisions Relating to Trade |work=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora |publisher=CITES |accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix II are the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae''), [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana''), [[queen conch]] (''Strombus gigas''), [[Emperor scorpion]] (''Pandinus imperator''), [[Mertens' water monitor]] (''Varanus mertensi''), bigleaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'') and [[lignum vitae]] \"ironwood\" (''Guaiacum officinale'').\n\n===Appendix III===\nAppendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species.  The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally.  In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\" />\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the [[two-toed sloth]]  (''Choloepus hoffmanni'') by Costa Rica, [[sitatunga]] (''Tragelaphus spekii'') by Ghana, [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta'') by Botswana, and [[alligator snapping turtle]] (''Macrochelys temminckii'') by the USA.\n\n==Amendments and reservations==\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting.  The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty.  Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see Reservations entered by Parties CITES<ref>http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php</ref> for current reservations).  Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\n\nNotable reservations include those by [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Norway]] on various [[baleen]] whale species and those on [[Falconiformes]] by Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"CITES-Reservations\">{{cite web|title=CITES Reservations Entered by Parties |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Shortcomings and concerns==\n\n===Approach to biodiversity conservation===\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, [[ecosystem approach]]es to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), although this has been changing (see [[Nile crocodile]], [[African elephant]], South African [[white rhino]] case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand.<ref name=Hill>Hill, 1990, \"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species: Fifteen Years Later,\" ''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Journal'' 13: 231</ref> In fact, CITES listings have been demonstrated to increase financial speculation in certain markets for high value species.<ref>{{cite web|last=Zhu|first= Annah|year= 2020|title=Restricting trade in endangered species can backfire, triggering market booms|work= The Conversation|url=https://theconversation.com/restricting-trade-in-endangered-species-can-backfire-triggering-market-booms-124869}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1613955|title=China\u2019s Rosewood Boom: A Cultural Fix to Capital Overaccumulation|first=Annah Lake|last=Zhu|date=2 January 2020|journal=Annals of the American Association of Geographers|volume=110|issue=1|pages=277\u2013296|via=Taylor and Francis+NEJM|doi=10.1080/24694452.2019.1613955}}</ref> Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\n\n===Drafting===\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"[[negative list]]\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated ''unless'' the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained.  Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review.  For example, recently several bird classified as [[IUCN Red List|threatened with extinction]] appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status.  If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\n\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\n\n===Reform suggestions===\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, [[TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network]] and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting.  CITES would benefit from access to [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.  Development of a future  mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.<ref name=\"Reeve\"/>\n\nOn 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant [[ivory]] from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.\n\n=== [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] Data ===\nFrom 2005 &ndash; 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers\n* 317,000 live birds\n* More than 2 million live reptiles\n* 2.5 million crocodile skins\n* 2.1 million [[Snakeskin|snake skins]]\n* 73 tons of [[caviar]]\n* 1.1 million beaver skins\n* Millions of pieces of [[coral]]\n* 20,000 mammalian [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophies]]\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.<ref>Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''.

The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) was held in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and the one before it (CoP 16) was held in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], in 2013.  The next one (CoP 18) will be in [[Sri Lanka]] in May 2019.  The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\n\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP.  The Committee meetings take place in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting. The Secretariat is administered by [[UNEP]]. The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings.  The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the latest one was held in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]] in May 2014.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=90|Meeting\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=1 width=110|City\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=120|Country\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=200|Duration\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 1\n|[[Bern]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 2\u20136 November 1976\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 2\n|[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n| 19\u201330 March 1979\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 3\n|[[New Delhi]]\n|{{flag|India}}\n| 25 February \u2013 8 March 1981\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 4\n|[[Gaborone]]\n|{{flag|Botswana}}\n| 19 \u2013 30 April 1983\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 5\n|[[Buenos Aires]]\n|{{flag|Argentina}}\n| 22 April \u2013 3 May 1985\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 6\n|[[Ottawa]]\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n| 12\u201324 July 1987\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 7\n|[[Lausanne]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 9\u201320 October 1989\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 8\n|[[Kyoto]]\n|{{flag|Japan}}\n| 2\u201313 March 1992\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 9\n|[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]]\n|{{flag|United States}}\n| 7\u201318 November 1994\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 10\n|[[Harare]]\n|{{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n| 9\u201320 June 1997\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 11\n|[[Gigiri]]\n|{{flag|Kenya}}\n| 10\u201320 April 2000\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 12\n|[[Santiago]]\n|{{flag|Chile}}\n| 3\u201315 November 2002\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 13\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 2\u201314 October 2004\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 14\n|[[The Hague]]\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n| 3\u201315 June 2007\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 15\n|[[Doha]]\n|{{flag|Qatar}}\n| 13\u201325 March 2010\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 16\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 3\u201314 March 2013\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 17\n|[[Johannesburg]]\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n| 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''CoP 18''\n|[[Geneva]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 17-28 August 2019\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 19\n|[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n| 2022\n|-\n|}\n\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php|title=CITES calendar &#124; CITES|website=www.cites.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n*[[Environmental agreements]]\n*[[IUCN Red List]]\n*[[Ivory trade]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix I]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix II]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix III]]\n*[[Shark finning]]\n*[[Wildlife conservation]]\n*[[Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System]]\n*[[Wildlife management]]\n*[[Wildlife smuggling]]\n*[[World Wildlife Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Oldfield, S. and McGough, N.

This is where he got introduced to photography for the first time. Since then, there was no looking back from photography as this medium of art made him discern another altogether unexpected side of him and has become the premise of his artistic exploration.\n\nDuring college Arjun was very interested in scientific [[high-speed photography]]. His inspiration was [[Harold Eugene Edgerton]]. He experimented capturing water splash and speeding air-gun pellets in his room with [[Do it yourself|DIY]] sound triggers and [[Motion detector|motion detectors]]. All of these experiments were done with conventional film [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR]] cameras. To fund his film rolls and equipment during college, he worked as a part-time freelance photographer shooting fashion shows and events.\n\n== Early Career ==\nArjun used to apprentice photographers part-time during college. After completing his degree in B.Sc [[Visual communication|Visual Communication]] at [[Loyola College, Chennai|Loyola college]] in 2004, he was a full-time apprentice with a photographer in Chennai. He had worked with him for two years before branching out independently in 2007. Later, Arjun worked independently on assignments in Chennai for almost two years. He was at the same time, looking out to move to a larger market in a larger city.\n\nHe received an opportunity to apprentice under a reputed fashion photographer based in [[Mumbai]].

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots. Lumpia Semarang is served either deep-fried or unfried, as the filling is already cooked.<ref name=\"IndoEats-Lumpia\"/>\n\n====Lumpia Surabaya====\nNamed after the city of [[Surabaya]] in East Java, where this lumpia was originally made.

However, unlike commonn rolled elongated fresh lumpia, lumpia Bandung is not served in [[spring roll]] form, but the lumpia skin is spread, topped with fillings, stacked and folded square just like an envelope. Unlike Semarang style lumpia that uses bamboo shoots and minced chicken, Bandung style lumpia filling uses julienned [[jicama]], [[beansprout]], scallion, garlic, chili, and scrambled egg, with [[palm sugar]] sauce.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.viva.co.id/gaya-hidup/kuliner/1119989-resep-lumpia-basah-bandung-kudapan-sehat-bikin-ngiler|title=RESEP: Lumpia Basah Bandung, Kudapan Sehat Bikin Ngiler|last=VIVA|first=PT VIVA MEDIA BARU-|date=2019-02-11|website=www.viva.co.id|language=id|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n====Lumpia goreng====\n[[File:Lumpia at Teh Jawa, Purwokerto Station, Purwokerto 2015-03-20.jpg|thumb|right|Smaller size deep fried lumpia served with [[sambal]] hot sauce, sold as a snack in Purwokerto Train Station, Central Java]]\n''Lumpia goreng'' is a simple fried spring rolls filled with vegetables; the spring roll wrappers are filled with chopped carrots cut into matchstick size, shredded cabbage, and sometimes mushrooms.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

In Indonesia lumpia is associated with [[Chinese Indonesian cuisine]] and commonly found in cities where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] settles. Although some local variants exist and the filling ingredients may vary, the most popular variant is ''Lumpia Semarang'', available in fried or unfried variants.\n\nUnlike its Philippines counterpart, Indonesian lumpia rarely uses minced [[pork]] as a filling. This was meant to cater to larger [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] clientele, thus popular fillings are usually chicken, shrimp, egg and vegetables. Indonesian lumpia is commonly filled with seasoned chopped ''rebung'' ([[bamboo shoot]]s) with minced chicken or prawns, served with fresh baby [[shallot]]s or [[leek]]s in sweet ''[[tauco]]'' (fermented soy) based sauce. Other than homemade, lumpia is also offered as street food sold by travelling vendor on carts, sold in foodstalls specializing on ''Lumpia Semarang'', or sold in traditional marketplaces as part of ''[[kue]]'' (Indonesian traditional snack) or ''jajan pasar'' (market munchies). Simpler and cheaper lumpia is sold as part of ''[[gorengan]]'' (Indonesian fritters). Indonesians are noted for their fondness of hot and spicy food, and therefore spicy hot ''[[sambal]]'' chili sauce or fresh bird's eye chili are usually added as a dipping sauce or condiment.\n\n====Lumpia Semarang====\n[[File:Loenpia Gang Lombok Semarang.jpg|thumb|right|Lumpia Semarang, specialty of [[Semarang]] city, Central Java.]]\nNamed after the capital city of Central Java in Indonesia, [[Semarang]], where significant [[Chinese Indonesian]] have settled, ''lumpia Semarang'' is perhaps the most popular lumpia variant in Indonesia. It has become associated with the city, and the spring rolls are often sought by the visitors in Semarang as food gift or souvenir. Originally made by Chinese immigrants, this lumpia is filled with [[bamboo shoots]], [[dried shrimp]], chicken, and/or prawns. It is served with a sweet chili sauce made from dried shrimp (optional), coconut sugar, red chili peppers, bird's eye chili peppers, ground white pepper, tapioca starch, water, and baby shallots.

They use various fillings inspired by local ingredients and dishes, and the later cuisines of Spain, China, and the United States. Filipino lumpia can be differentiated from other Asian spring roll versions in that they use a paper-thin wrapper made from just flour, water, and salt. They were also traditionally slender and long, with a shape roughly similar to that of [[cigar]]s or ''[[cigarillo]]s'', though modern versions can come in various shapes and sizes. The thinness of the cr\u00eape and the shape of the lumpia give them a relatively denser wrapping that nevertheless remain flaky and light in texture. They are also traditionally dipped in ''[[agre dulce]]'' (sweet and sour sauce), vinegar-based sauces, [[banana ketchup]], or [[sweet chili sauce]]. Fresh lumpia, however, have wrappers which are more [[cr\u00eape]]-like and thicker due to the addition of eggs (though still thinner than other Asian versions). They are closer in texture to the original Chinese versions and were traditionally made with rice flour which makes them chewier. Various kinds of lumpia, fried or fresh, are ubiquitous in Filipino celebrations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Filipino Lumpia Recipe |url=http://chefpablos.com/recipe/filipino-lumpia-recipe/ |website=Chef Pablo's |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Dwyer\">{{cite web |last1=Dwyer |first1=A.E. |title=Everything you need to know about Asian egg rolls |url=https://thetakeout.com/asian-egg-rolls-cha-gio-spring-rolls-lumpia-1826717513 |website=The Takeout |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"santanachote\">{{cite web |last1=Santanachote |first1=Perry |title=Beyond Egg Rolls: 9 Spring Rolls Everyone Should Know About |url=https://www.thrillist.com/eat/nation/the-differences-between-egg-rolls-spring-rolls-popiah-and-lumpia |website=Thrillist |accessdate=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nFilipino lumpia also have a unique and extremely popular [[dessert]] subcategory, the ''[[Turon (food)|turon]]''.

Here, the former explains most of the 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness and planet thermal emission contributes to much of the 0.8&nbsp;\u03bcm brightness. Their non-detections with ground-based infrared data suggested that Fomalhaut b had to be less massive than about 3 Jupiter masses.\n\nHowever, Fomalhaut b should be detectable in space-based infrared data if its mass is between 1-3 Jupiter masses.  But sensitive infrared Spitzer Space Telescope observations failed to detect Fomalhaut b, implying that Fomalhaut b has less than 1 Jupiter mass.<ref name=\"Janson2012\"/>  Furthermore, although the planet was thought to be a plausible explanation for Fomalhaut's eccentric debris ring, measurements in the Kalas et al. paper hinted that it was moving too fast (i.e. not apsidally aligned) for this explanation to work.  Finally, researchers analyzing September\u2013October 2011 [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA) data for Fomalhaut's debris ring suggested an alternate hypothesis: that the ring could be shaped by much smaller, shepherding planets, neither of which needed to be Fomalhaut b.<ref name=\"Boley2012\">{{Cite journal |title=Constraining the Planetary System of Fomalhaut Using High-resolution ALMA Observations |first=Aaron |last=Boley |journal=Astrophysical Journal |date=2012 |arxiv = 1204.0007|bibcode = 2012ApJ...750L..21B |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/750/1/L21 |volume=750 |pages=L21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=36681 |title=ALMA Reveals Workings of Nearby Planetary System |accessdate=2012-04-18}}</ref>  These results invoked skepticism about Fomalhaut b's status as an extrasolar planet.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20945-new-doubts-about-poster-child-of-exoplanets.html |author=Lisa Grossman |title=New doubts about 'poster child' of exoplanets |journal=New Scientist |publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Yudhijit Bhattacharjee |title=Celebrated Exoplanet Vanishes in a Cloud of Dust-Or Maybe Not |journal=Science |page=515 |volume=335 |date=3 February 2012 |bibcode = 2012Sci...335..515B |doi = 10.1126/science.335.6068.515 |issue=6068}}</ref>\n\n==Recovery, independent confirmation by Hubble and further additional findings==\nOn October 24, 2012, a team led by Thayne Currie at the [[University of Toronto]] announced the first independent recovery of Fomalhaut b and revived the claim that Fomalhaut b identifies a planet.<ref name=\"Currie\"/> They reanalyzed the original Hubble data using new, more powerful algorithms for separating planet light from starlight and confirmed that Fomalhaut b does exist. They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.   Thus, they consider Fomalhaut b to plausibly be a \"planet identified from direct imaging\" even if Fomalhaut b is not, strictly speaking, a directly imaged planet insofar as the light does not come from a planetary atmosphere.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>\n\nA second paper made public a day later and led by Raphael Galicher and Christian Marois at the [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] also independently recovered Fomalhaut b and confirmed the new 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m detection, claiming the spectral energy distribution (SED) of Fomalhaut b cannot be explained as due to direct or scattered radiation from a massive planet. They considered two models to explain the SED: (1) a large circumplanetary disk around a massive, but unseen, planet and (2) the aftermath of a collision during the past 100 years of two Kuiper belt objects of radii about 50&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nSubsequent Hubble data obtained in 2010 and 2012 with the [[STIS]] instrument by [[Paul Kalas]] and collaborators again recovered Fomalhaut b<ref name=\"Kalas2013\">.

Fomalhaut b's high eccentricity may be evidence for a significant dynamical interaction with a hitherto unseen planet at a smaller orbital separation.\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\nAssuming that Fomalhaut b's orbit is in the same plane as the debris disk located exterior to it, it orbits [[Fomalhaut]] at a distance of approximately {{convert|115|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}}.

A circumplanetary ring system is large enough to scatter enough starlight to make Fomalhaut b visible only if it has a radius between 20 and 40 times that of Jupiter's radius.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/>  A spherical cloud of dust with a radius of {{convert|0.004|AU|km mi|lk=in|abbr=on}} can make Fomalhaut b visible.<ref name=\"Currie\"/>  Fomalhaut b appears as an unresolved point source in the highest-quality data (at 0.6&nbsp;\u03bcm) which would suggest that its projected emitting area cannot be larger than about 0.25 AU, about 1/4th of the Earth\u2013Sun distance.<ref name=\"Kalas2008\"/><ref name=\"Currie\"/>  However, it may be resolved at slightly longer wavelengths, indicating that its emitting area is larger.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\nThe mass of Fomalhaut b, if a planet, is highly uncertain.

They also provided a new detection of Fomalhaut b at 0.4&nbsp;\u00b5m.\nThey modeled the optical detections and infrared upper limits for Fomalhaut b, showing that Fomalhaut b's emission can be completely explained by starlight scattered by small dust and arguing that this dust surrounds an unseen planetary-mass object.

Infrared non-detections suggest that Fomalhaut b cannot be more massive than 2 times [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]]<ref name=\"Currie\"/><ref name=\"Janson2012\"/> but a lower limit on the mass depends on uncertain details for the nature of Fomalhaut b, its circumplanetary environment, and the existence of other planetary-mass bodies in the system.  Models of Fomalhaut b sculpting the star's debris disk give a mass 0.5 times that of Jupiter.  Models for Fomalhaut b assuming it is surrounded by a swarm of planetesimals imply that it could be much lower mass (10\u2013100 times the [[Earth mass|mass of Earth]]).<ref name=\"Kennedy2011\"/>  If Fomalhaut b is instead one of two shepherding planets that together confine the debris disk into a narrow ring,<ref name=\"Boley2012\"/> it could be anywhere between several times the mass of [[Mars]] to slightly more massive than Earth.\n\nIf Fomalhaut b is a gas giant like Jupiter or Saturn, it probably formed several million years after the host star itself was formed, making it roughly 450 million years old.<ref name=\"Mamajek2012\">{{Cite journal |title=On the Age and Binarity of Fomalhaut |first=Eric |last=Mamajek |journal=Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2012 |arxiv = 1206.6353|bibcode = 2012ApJ...754L..20M |doi = 10.1088/2041-8205/754/2/L20 |volume=754 |pages=L20}}</ref>  Alternatively, if it is a transient dust cloud it must be extremely young,<ref name=\"Currie\"/> perhaps having formed within the last few centuries.<ref name=\"Galicher\"/>\n\n== Other planets orbiting Fomalhaut ==\n\nFomalhaut b is orbiting its host star at a wide separation, where forming massive planets is difficult. To explain its current location, Fomalhaut b could have been dynamically scattered by a more massive, unseen body located at smaller separations. Several ground-based observations have searched for this hypothetical Fomalhaut \"c\" but have yet to find it. At very small, Solar-System-like scales any additional companions must have a mass less than thirteen times the mass of Jupiter.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Coronagraphic Observations of Fomalhaut at Solar System Scales|author=Matthew A.
