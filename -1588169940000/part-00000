It is significant to the Hindu sect of [[Saivism]] as one of the seven major Shiva temples.  Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]'', with his idol referred to as ''Jothimayalingam''. His consort [[Mookambika]] is depicted as Pirguchuntarakujambigai. The ''lingam'' of the temple is believed to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil poet saints known as the [[nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0162.pdf\n |title=Campantar Tevaram -2\n |work=Projectmadurai.org\n |accessdate=16 July 2011\n}}</ref> The 9th century ''Saiva'' saint poet [[Manikkavacakar]] has sung praise about the temple in his works.\n\nThere are 149 inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from [[Pandyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering [[gopuram]] gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.\n\nThe temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses four gateway towers known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mahalingeswaraswamy, Pirguchuntaragujambigai and Mookambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar period]] that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by [[Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam]], a South Indian monastic institution.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimaruthur13.jpg|thumb|Tiruvidaimaruthur temple|250px|left]]\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Jug's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">[[#Herbermann|Herbermann 1934]], p. 710</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The ''kumbha'' is believed to have been displaced by a ''[[pralaya]]'' (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of [[Kumbakonam]] now stands.<ref name=\"chandrasekharendrap73\">[[#Sastri|Sastri 1991]], p. 73</ref><ref name=\"ancienttamilsp88\">[[#Pillai|Pillai]], p. 88</ref> The drops of nectar are believed to have fallen onto five shrines around Kumbakonam, namely Mahalingeswarar temple at [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tirudharasuram, [[Rahu Stalam|Naganathar Temple]] at [[Tirunageswaram]], Tiruvorgam and  Tirupadalavanam.<ref>[[#Dalal|Dalal 2010]], p. 202</ref>\n\nThe legend of a [[Chola]] prince who killed a [[Brahmin]] and was in turn, pursued by his spirit (''Brahmarakshas''), is associated with the temple. The Chola prince, it is believed, entered the Mahalingeswarar Temple and prayed to his favourite God, [[Shiva]] for relief from the clutches of the spirit of the dead Brahmin or ''brahmarakshas''. The Chola prince made his way out through another entrance thereby saving himself.<ref name=\"Ayyar\">[[#Ayyar|Ayyar 1991]], p. 299</ref> Some sources associate the legend with [[Pandya]] king [[Varagunapandian]].<ref name=\"R\">[[#R.|R. 2001]], pp. 145-6</ref> It continues till day where people take the second entrance to exit the premises after worship.  There is a sculpture of ''Chola brahmaharakshas'' on the eastern premises in one of the inner ''[[gopurams]]'' (tower gateway).\n\nShiva is believed to have appeared as a flame to please [[Agastya]] and other sages who were performing penance. Shiva (Rudra) is said to have emanated from the heart of Mookambika. It is also believed that several other deities like [[Vinayaga]], [[Murugan]], [[Parvathi]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswathi]], [[Brahma]], [[Airavata]] (the elephant of celestial king [[Indra]]) and [[Vishnu]] worshipped Mahalingaswamy.<ref name=\"R\"/>\n\n==Etymology ==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimarudur 7.JPG|250px|thumb|Image of the second precinct|right]]\nMarudur is derived from the name of the holy tree, namely Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/><ref name=\"tourist\"/> The ''[[Sthala Vriksha]]'' (temple tree) is Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/> This temple is classified as ''Madhya Arjunam'', called ''Idai Maruthu'' meaning centre Marudur.<ref name=\"padal\"/>  The  [[Mallikarjuna Swamy|Mallikarjuna swamy temple]] are [[Srisailam]] is called ''Thalai Maruthu'' (meaning top Marudur) and Tirupudaimaruthur temple at [[Ambasamudram]] in [[Tirunelveli district]] is called ''Kadai Maruthu'' (meaning lower Marudur).<ref name=\"padal\"/> Since Shiva raised out as a flame to the sages, the presiding deity is also referred as Jyothirmaya Mahalingam. Historically Shiva was worshipped as Jyothi, the sacred flame and with the course of time, [[Jyotirlinga|Jyothrilinga temples]] were developed. Since the place is full of Maruda tree, Shiva is also referred as Marudavanan. The [[Sanskrit]] meaning of the word ''Maruda'' is Archunam, deriving the Tamil name of Idaimaruthu against Mathiarchunam.<ref name=Om35>[[#Om|Narayanaswamy 1987]], pp. 35-6</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\nThere are a total of 149 inscriptions associated with the temple.<ref name=\"R\"/> According to legend, the site of the temple at Thiruvidaimarudur has been used for over 2,000 years and is associated with the [[Pandya]] king Varaguna Pandian. The temple contains inscriptions of the [[Hoysala]] kings and some [[Vijayanagara]] grants, and many records of the later Nayaks and [[Marathas]].<ref>''Imperial gazetteer of India: Provincial series, Volume 18, p.137</ref> The inscriptions in the walls of the temple are from [[Kulothunga Chola I]] indicating revenue survey and settlement and other additions made inside the temple.<ref name=\"Ayyar\"/> This inscription (No. 32 of 1895)<!-- not 1095???? --> on the second precinct records a grant of 120 sheep for two lamps and the ''pujaris'' and inhabitants are appointed trustees of the grant.  The date is the 172nd day of 26th year of the reign of Kulothunga I, who conquered the [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] region.  The other inscriptions mention the name of the queen and adore her as the \"mistress of the whole world\".

It is significant to the Hindu sect of [[Saivism]] as one of the seven major Shiva temples.  Shiva is worshiped as Mahalingeswaraswamy, and is represented by the ''[[lingam]]'', with his idol referred to as ''Jothimayalingam''. His consort [[Mookambika]] is depicted as Pirguchuntarakujambigai. The ''lingam'' of the temple is believed to be the focal point for the seven consorts of Shiva. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the ''[[Tevaram]]'', written by Tamil poet saints known as the [[nayanars]] and classified as ''[[Paadal Petra Sthalam]]''.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0162.pdf\n |title=Campantar Tevaram -2\n |work=Projectmadurai.org\n |accessdate=16 July 2011\n}}</ref> The 9th century ''Saiva'' saint poet [[Manikkavacakar]] has sung praise about the temple in his works.\n\nThere are 149 inscriptions associated with the temple indicating contributions from [[Pandyas]], [[Cholas]], [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] and [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The oldest parts of the present masonry structure were built during the [[Chola dynasty]] in the 9th century, while later expansions, including the towering [[gopuram]] gatehouses, are attributed to later periods, up to the Thanjavur Nayaks during the 16th century.\n\nThe temple complex is one of the largest in the state and it houses four gateway towers known as ''[[gopurams]]''. The temple has numerous shrines, with those of Mahalingeswaraswamy, Pirguchuntaragujambigai and Mookambigai being the most prominent. The temple complex houses many halls and three precincts; the most notable is the second precinct built during the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar period]] that has many sculptures. The temple has six daily rituals at various times from [[5:30]] a.m. to 10 p.m., and twelve yearly festivals on its calendar. The temple is maintained and administered by [[Thiruvaduthurai Adheenam]], a South Indian monastic institution.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimaruthur13.jpg|thumb|Tiruvidaimaruthur temple|250px|left]]\nThe name \"Kumbakonam\", roughly translated in English as the \"Jug's Corner\",<ref name=\"catholicp710\">[[#Herbermann|Herbermann 1934]], p. 710</ref> is believed to be an [[allusion]] to the mythical pot (''[[kumbha]]'') of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Brahma]] that contained the seed of all living beings on earth. The ''kumbha'' is believed to have been displaced by a ''[[pralaya]]'' (dissolution of the universe) and ultimately came to rest at the spot where the town of [[Kumbakonam]] now stands.<ref name=\"chandrasekharendrap73\">[[#Sastri|Sastri 1991]], p. 73</ref><ref name=\"ancienttamilsp88\">[[#Pillai|Pillai]], p. 88</ref> The drops of nectar are believed to have fallen onto five shrines around Kumbakonam, namely Mahalingeswarar temple at [[Tiruvidaimarudur]], Tirudharasuram, [[Rahu Stalam|Naganathar Temple]] at [[Tirunageswaram]], Tiruvorgam and  Tirupadalavanam.<ref>[[#Dalal|Dalal 2010]], p. 202</ref>\n\nThe legend of a [[Chola]] prince who killed a [[Brahmin]] and was in turn, pursued by his spirit (''Brahmarakshas''), is associated with the temple. The Chola prince, it is believed, entered the Mahalingeswarar Temple and prayed to his favourite God, [[Shiva]] for relief from the clutches of the spirit of the dead Brahmin or ''brahmarakshas''. The Chola prince made his way out through another entrance thereby saving himself.<ref name=\"Ayyar\">[[#Ayyar|Ayyar 1991]], p. 299</ref> Some sources associate the legend with [[Pandya]] king [[Varagunapandian]].<ref name=\"R\">[[#R.|R. 2001]], pp. 145-6</ref> It continues till day where people take the second entrance to exit the premises after worship.  There is a sculpture of ''Chola brahmaharakshas'' on the eastern premises in one of the inner ''[[gopurams]]'' (tower gateway).\n\nShiva is believed to have appeared as a flame to please [[Agastya]] and other sages who were performing penance. Shiva (Rudra) is said to have emanated from the heart of Mookambika. It is also believed that several other deities like [[Vinayaga]], [[Murugan]], [[Parvathi]], [[Kali]], [[Lakshmi]], [[Saraswathi]], [[Brahma]], [[Airavata]] (the elephant of celestial king [[Indra]]) and [[Vishnu]] worshipped Mahalingaswamy.<ref name=\"R\"/>\n\n==Etymology ==\n[[File:Tiruvidaimarudur 7.JPG|250px|thumb|Image of the second precinct|right]]\nMarudur is derived from the name of the holy tree, namely Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/><ref name=\"tourist\"/> The ''[[Sthala Vriksha]]'' (temple tree) is Maruda.<ref name=\"R\"/> This temple is classified as ''Madhya Arjunam'', called ''Idai Maruthu'' meaning centre Marudur.<ref name=\"padal\"/>  The  [[Mallikarjuna Swamy|Mallikarjuna swamy temple]] are [[Srisailam]] is called ''Thalai Maruthu'' (meaning top Marudur) and Tirupudaimaruthur temple at [[Ambasamudram]] in [[Tirunelveli district]] is called ''Kadai Maruthu'' (meaning lower Marudur).<ref name=\"padal\"/> Since Shiva raised out as a flame to the sages, the presiding deity is also referred as Jyothirmaya Mahalingam. Historically Shiva was worshipped as Jyothi, the sacred flame and with the course of time, [[Jyotirlinga|Jyothrilinga temples]] were developed. Since the place is full of Maruda tree, Shiva is also referred as Marudavanan. The [[Sanskrit]] meaning of the word ''Maruda'' is Archunam, deriving the Tamil name of Idaimaruthu against Mathiarchunam.<ref name=Om35>[[#Om|Narayanaswamy 1987]], pp. 35-6</ref>\n\n==Inscriptions==\nThere are a total of 149 inscriptions associated with the temple.<ref name=\"R\"/> According to legend, the site of the temple at Thiruvidaimarudur has been used for over 2,000 years and is associated with the [[Pandya]] king Varaguna Pandian.

Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the [[Shaivism|Shaivaite]] community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:00&nbsp;a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00&nbsp;a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00&nbsp;p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00&nbsp;p.m., Irandamkalam at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: ''abhisheka'' (sacred bath), ''alangaram'' (decoration), ''neivethanam'' (food offering) and ''deepa aradanai'' (waving of lamps) for both Mahalingeswarar and Pirguchuntaragujambigai. The worship is held amidst music with ''[[nagaswaram]]'' (pipe instrument) and ''[[tavil]]'' (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the [[Vedas]]  read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like ''{{lang|te-Latn|somavaram}}'' and ''{{lang|te-Latn|sukravaram}}'', fortnightly rituals like ''[[pradosha]]m'' and monthly festivals like ''[[amavasya|amavasai]]'' (new moon day), ''kiruthigai'', ''[[pournami (festival)|pournami]]'' (full moon day) and ''sathurthi''.<ref name=\"dinamalar\"/> The most prominent festival of the temple, [[Thaipoosam]], is celebrated for ten days during the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month of ''Thai''.<ref name=\"R\"/><ref name=\"dinamalar\"/> The festival deity of Mahalingeswarar and his consort [[Parikrama|circumambulate the temple]] and the streets in the village in different vehicles.

Gray]], and some of the people who originally implemented the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]], notably [[Philip S. Abrams]], [[Lawrence M. Breed]], and Allen Rose.<ref>[http://alumninet.yale.edu/classes/yc1962/obituaries/grayb.html Burton C. Gray's Yale obituary]</ref>  In 1970, STSC released ''APL*Plus'', a version of the ''APL\\360'' language with many practical extensions oriented toward fostering business use of APL. Together with [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], STSC made many enhancements to the APL language, including:\n* []FMT formatting\n* []VR and []FX, APL program [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] features\n* a file system to store APL variables outside of the APL environment\n \nSTSC continued to make enhancements to the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], notably improving the performance of many of the primitive [[Subroutine|function]]s.\n\nIn 1985, Dan Dyer of STSC and Ian Sharp of [[I. P. Sharp Associates]] jointly received the ''Kenneth E. [[Iverson Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to APL''.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the timesharing market began collapsing, mostly due to the appearance in the marketplace of relatively lower cost IBM [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM 4300]]. STSC quickly changed its focus to supply APL services for in-house and the rapidly developing [[personal computer]] (PC) market.\n\nIn 1982, STSC released ''APL*Plus/PC'', which was a very successful APL [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the IBM personal computer. In the mid 1980s, STSC developed the ''APL*Plus/Unix'' interpreter, a full 32-bit interpreter which was the basis of further APL development, notably ''APL*Plus/386'', which was later available for [[Intel 386]] class machines and higher. Arguably, the ''APL*Plus/386'' interpreter fostered the exodus of APL applications from mainframe to PC environments, as the hardware and software were finally correctly matched to facilitate a straightforward migration of medium- to large-sized applications away from mainframes.\n\nIn the mid 1980s, STSC released an APL [[compiler]] for its APL*Plus add-on for the IBM VSAPL [[License Program Product]]. Along with language features designed to profile code execution, this compiler implementation was oriented toward replacing resource-consuming functions in place with compiled ones, leading to overall performance improvements.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, the ''APL*Plus/386'' system had become one of the leading APL interpreters in the market, however it did not run under the then-new [[Microsoft Windows 3.1]]. Although there were some attempts at Windows interoperability, development on the ''APL*Plus/Win'' product began shortly before the APL products were sold to ''LEX2000''.

Gray]], and some of the people who originally implemented the programming language [[APL (programming language)|APL]], notably [[Philip S. Abrams]], [[Lawrence M. Breed]], and Allen Rose.<ref>[http://alumninet.yale.edu/classes/yc1962/obituaries/grayb.html Burton C. Gray's Yale obituary]</ref>  In 1970, STSC released ''APL*Plus'', a version of the ''APL\\360'' language with many practical extensions oriented toward fostering business use of APL. Together with [[I. P. Sharp Associates]], STSC made many enhancements to the APL language, including:\n* []FMT formatting\n* []VR and []FX, APL program [[Reflection (computer programming)|reflection]] features\n* a file system to store APL variables outside of the APL environment\n \nSTSC continued to make enhancements to the [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]], notably improving the performance of many of the primitive [[Subroutine|function]]s.\n\nIn 1985, Dan Dyer of STSC and Ian Sharp of [[I. P. Sharp Associates]] jointly received the ''Kenneth E. [[Iverson Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to APL''.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the timesharing market began collapsing, mostly due to the appearance in the marketplace of relatively lower cost IBM [[mainframe computer]]s, such as the [[IBM 4300]]. STSC quickly changed its focus to supply APL services for in-house and the rapidly developing [[personal computer]] (PC) market.\n\nIn 1982, STSC released ''APL*Plus/PC'', which was a very successful APL [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the IBM personal computer.

A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]] of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.<ref name=\"lindsays\">Jervise, A.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy. Large parts of the town were destroyed in the aftermath by the Lindsay family.<ref name=\"lindsays\">Jervise, A.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present.

Smokies are made from [[haddock]] using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.<ref name='defra1'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |title=Arbroath Smokie PGI \n |accessdate=8 February 2009 \n |date=31 March 2004 \n |work=Protected Food Names \n |publisher=HM Government \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130959/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |archivedate=25 December 2008 \n |url-status = dead\n |df=dmy \n}} \n</ref> The preparation of smokies remains a [[cottage industry]] in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area.

Tom 'Big Fish' Smith now captains the somewhat \u2018undercooked\u2019 Sunday side. Tom is a product of the Kings School, Worcester where he achieved excellence in all his school work, probably due to playing 'Soggy Biscuit' with the Headmaster. Unfortunately he can\u2019t seem to get this excellence to rub off on the field. Tom also lives in the shadows of his father a prolific and heavy drinker and monkey fister, who has played for multiple clubs and shown his array of cricket talent where ever he has played, something that Tom has failed to replicate since breaking two of his toes on his webbed foot and contracting a nasty rash on his 'Old Chap'!\n\nThe rash has dissapeared but his cricketing skills are still woefully dreadful. The local 'Jungle News' said that the rash was caused by 'rooting' a lady o'the night in Solihull a while ago and according to an 'ex-girlfriend' of Tom's, the rash was on one side only and his 'Old Chap' now bends to the left like a Costa-Rican Banana!...\n\nTom is well settled at Peopleton now as he claim\u2019s \u2018he loves to be the big fish in a small pond\u2019 something that other key members of the side my feel is in correct.

The design features one large star, with four smaller stars in a semicircle set off towards the fly (the side farthest from the flag pole). The red represents the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|revolution]]; the five stars and their relationship represent the unity of the [[Chinese people]] under the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).  The first flag was hoisted by the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) on a pole overlooking Beijing's [[Tiananmen Square]] on 1 October 1949, at a ceremony announcing the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nOther flags used in the People's Republic use a red background to symbolize the revolution in conjunction with other symbols. The flag of the [[People's Liberation Army]] uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the [[Communist Party of China]] replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]]. However, this law was defied when the cities of [[Kaifeng]] and [[Shangrao]] adopted their flags in March 2006 and March 2009 respectively.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Flag of the Qing dynasty|Flag of the Republic of China}}\n\n===Early flags===\n[[File:Flag_of_China_(1862\u20131889).svg|alt=Flag of the Qing Dynasty|thumb|[[Flag of the Qing Dynasty]]]]\n\nOne of the first earlier flags of China was the \"[[Yellow Dragon Flag]]\" used by the [[Qing dynasty]] from 1862 until the overthrow of the monarchy during the Xinhai Revolution.  The Qing dynasty was the last imperial dynasty in China's history. The flag that was adopted in 1862 was triangular, but the dynasty adopted a rectangular version of the dragon flag in 1889.\n\n===Republic of China===\n[[File:Flag of the Republic of China.svg|alt=Flag of the Republic of China|thumb|[[Flag of the Republic of China]]]]\n\nThe [[Flag terminology|canton]] (upper corner on the hoist side) originated from the \"[[Blue Sky with a White Sun|Blue Sky with a White Sun flag]]\" ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u9752\u5929|\u767d\u65e5|\u65d7}}|p=q\u012bngti\u0101n b\u00e1ir\u00ec q\u00ed|labels=no}}) designed by [[Lu Haodong]], a martyr of the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the [[Society for Regenerating China]], an [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Qing]] society in [[Hong Kong]], on 21 February 1895. This design was later adopted as the KMT party flag and the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of China]]. The \"red Earth\" portion was added by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in winter of 1906, bringing the flag to its modern form. According to [[George Yeo]], the Foreign Minister of Singapore, in those days the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag was sewn in the Sun Yat Sen Villa or [[Wan Qing Yuan]] in Singapore by Teo Eng Hock and his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,15231,|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610153714/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,15231,|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2011|title=MFA Press Release Admin Page|date=10 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/onceupon/spsupp.html Dr Sun & 1911 Revolution: Teo Eng Hock (1871\u20131957)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126010654/http://wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/onceupon/spsupp.html |date=2009-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wuchang Uprising]] in 1911 that heralded the Republic, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was used in the provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Guizhou]]. In [[Wuhan]], a flag with 18 yellow stars was used to represent the 18 [[history of the political divisions of China|administrative divisions]] at the time. In [[Shanghai]] and northern China, a \"Five-Colored Flag\" ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u4e94\u8272|\u65d7}}|p=w\u01d4 s\u00e8 q\u00ed|labels=no}}) ([[Five Races Under One Union]] flag) was used of five horizontal stripes representing the five major [[nationalities of China]]: the [[Han Chinese|Han]] (red), the [[Manchu]] (yellow), the [[Mongol]] (blue), the [[Hui Chinese|Hui]] (white), and the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] (black).\n\nWhen the government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] was established on January 1, 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag.

He continued using this design when the KMT established a [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|rival government]] in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. The modern flag was made the official national flag on December 17, 1928 after the successful [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] that overthrew the [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]], though the Five-Colored Flag still continued to be used by locals in an unofficial capacity. One reason for this discrepancy in use was lingering regional biases held by officials and citizens of northern China, who favored the Five-Colored Flag, against southerners such as the [[Guangdong|Cantonese]]/Hakka Sun Yat-sen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nDuring [[the Second Sino-Japanese War]], the invading [[Japan]]ese established a [[Japanese puppet states|variety of puppet governments]] using several flag designs. The \"[[Reformed Government of the Republic of China|Reform Government]]\" established in March 1938 in [[Nanjing]] to consolidate the various puppet governments employed the Five-Colored Flag. When [[Wang Jingwei]] was slated to take over the [[Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China|Japanese-installed government in Nanjing]] in 1940, he demanded to use the modern flag as a means to challenge the authority of the [[Nationalist Government]] in [[Chongqing]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and position himself as the rightful successor to Sun Yat-sen. However, the Japanese preferred the Five-Colored flag. As a compromise, the Japanese suggested adding a triangular yellow pennant on top with the slogan \"Peace, Anti-Communism, National Construction\" ({{zh|t=\u548c\u5e73\u53cd\u5171\u5efa\u570b|p=H\u00e9p\u00edng f\u01ceng\u00f2ng ji\u00e0n gu\u00f3|labels=no}}) in black, but this was rejected by Wang. In the end, Wang and the Japanese agreed that the yellow banner was to be used outdoors only, until 1943 when the banner was abandoned, leaving two rival governments with the same flag, each claiming to be the legitimate National Government of China.<ref>{{cite journal\n |first=Andrew \n |last=Cheung \n |title=Slogans, Symbols, and Legitimacy: The Case of Wang Jingwei's Nanjing Regime \n |version=Working paper \n |publisher=East Asian Working Paper Series on Language and Politics in Modern China \n |year=1995 \n |url = http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/working_paper/noframe_6a_sloga.htm \n |access-date=24 July 2008 \n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226023546/http://www.indiana.edu/~easc/resources/working_paper/noframe_6a_sloga.htm \n |archive-date=26 February 2008 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\nThe flag was specified in Article Six of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|1947 Constitution]].

In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic over several nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design came from the stars shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb \"longing for the stars, longing for the moon\", ({{lang|zh|\u76fc\u661f\u661f\u76fc\u6708\u4eae}}, ''p\u00e0n x\u012bngx\u012bng p\u00e0n yu\u00e8li\u00e0ng'') which shows yearning.

The idea for four small stars came from [[On the People's Democratic Dictatorship]], a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four [[social class]]es, also referred to in Asian cultures as the [[four occupations]] ({{lang|zh|\u58eb\u8fb2\u5de5\u5546}}) ''shi, nong, gong, shang'' (\"the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-4/mswv4_65.htm|title=On the People's Democratic Dictatorship : In Commemoration of the Twenty-eighth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China, June 30, 1949|accessdate=2017-09-27}}</ref>).

The design features one large star, with four smaller stars in a semicircle set off towards the fly (the side farthest from the flag pole). The red represents the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|revolution]]; the five stars and their relationship represent the unity of the [[Chinese people]] under the leadership of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC).  The first flag was hoisted by the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) on a pole overlooking Beijing's [[Tiananmen Square]] on 1 October 1949, at a ceremony announcing the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]].\n\nOther flags used in the People's Republic use a red background to symbolize the revolution in conjunction with other symbols. The flag of the [[People's Liberation Army]] uses the gold star with the Chinese characters 8-1 (for 1 August, the date of the PLA's founding). The flag of the [[Communist Party of China]] replaces all of the stars with the party emblem. Due to government regulations, cities and provinces of China cannot have their own flags; the only sub-national flags that exist are those of the [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]].

He presented his design to represent the revolutionary army at the inauguration of the [[Society for Regenerating China]], an [[Anti-Qing sentiment|anti-Qing]] society in [[Hong Kong]], on 21 February 1895. This design was later adopted as the KMT party flag and the [[Coat of Arms of the Republic of China]]. The \"red Earth\" portion was added by [[Sun Yat-sen]] in winter of 1906, bringing the flag to its modern form. According to [[George Yeo]], the Foreign Minister of Singapore, in those days the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag was sewn in the Sun Yat Sen Villa or [[Wan Qing Yuan]] in Singapore by Teo Eng Hock and his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,15231,|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610153714/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/pr/read_content.asp?View,15231,|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 June 2011|title=MFA Press Release Admin Page|date=10 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/onceupon/spsupp.html Dr Sun & 1911 Revolution: Teo Eng Hock (1871\u20131957)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126010654/http://wanqingyuan.com.sg/english/onceupon/spsupp.html |date=2009-11-26 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wuchang Uprising]] in 1911 that heralded the Republic, the various revolutionary armies had different flags. Lu Hao-tung's \"Blue Sky with a White Sun\" flag was used in the provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Yunnan]], and [[Guizhou]]. In [[Wuhan]], a flag with 18 yellow stars was used to represent the 18 [[history of the political divisions of China|administrative divisions]] at the time. In [[Shanghai]] and northern China, a \"Five-Colored Flag\" ({{zh|c={{linktext|\u4e94\u8272|\u65d7}}|p=w\u01d4 s\u00e8 q\u00ed|labels=no}}) ([[Five Races Under One Union]] flag) was used of five horizontal stripes representing the five major [[nationalities of China]]: the [[Han Chinese|Han]] (red), the [[Manchu]] (yellow), the [[Mongol]] (blue), the [[Hui Chinese|Hui]] (white), and the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] (black).\n\nWhen the government of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] was established on January 1, 1912, the \"Five-Colored Flag\" was selected by the provisional Senate as the national flag.

He continued using this design when the KMT established a [[Government of the Republic of China in Guangzhou|rival government]] in [[Guangzhou]] in 1917. The modern flag was made the official national flag on December 17, 1928 after the successful [[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]] that overthrew the [[Beiyang government|Beijing government]], though the Five-Colored Flag still continued to be used by locals in an unofficial capacity. One reason for this discrepancy in use was lingering regional biases held by officials and citizens of northern China, who favored the Five-Colored Flag, against southerners such as the [[Guangdong|Cantonese]]/Hakka Sun Yat-sen.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nDuring [[the Second Sino-Japanese War]], the invading [[Japan]]ese established a [[Japanese puppet states|variety of puppet governments]] using several flag designs. The \"[[Reformed Government of the Republic of China|Reform Government]]\" established in March 1938 in [[Nanjing]] to consolidate the various puppet governments employed the Five-Colored Flag. When [[Wang Jingwei]] was slated to take over the [[Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China|Japanese-installed government in Nanjing]] in 1940, he demanded to use the modern flag as a means to challenge the authority of the [[Nationalist Government]] in [[Chongqing]] under [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and position himself as the rightful successor to Sun Yat-sen. However, the Japanese preferred the Five-Colored flag. As a compromise, the Japanese suggested adding a triangular yellow pennant on top with the slogan \"Peace, Anti-Communism, National Construction\" ({{zh|t=\u548c\u5e73\u53cd\u5171\u5efa\u570b|p=H\u00e9p\u00edng f\u01ceng\u00f2ng ji\u00e0n gu\u00f3|labels=no}}) in black, but this was rejected by Wang.

In the middle of July, he sat down in his attic over several nights to come up with designs. His inspiration for the current design came from the stars shining in the night sky. He thought of a Chinese proverb \"longing for the stars, longing for the moon\", ({{lang|zh|\u76fc\u661f\u661f\u76fc\u6708\u4eae}}, ''p\u00e0n x\u012bngx\u012bng p\u00e0n yu\u00e8li\u00e0ng'') which shows yearning.

The idea for four small stars came from [[On the People's Democratic Dictatorship]], a speech by Mao Zedong, which defined the Chinese people as consisting of four [[social class]]es, also referred to in Asian cultures as the [[four occupations]] ({{lang|zh|\u58eb\u8fb2\u5de5\u5546}}) ''shi, nong, gong, shang'' (\"the working class, the peasantry, the urban petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-4/mswv4_65.htm|title=On the People's Democratic Dictatorship : In Commemoration of the Twenty-eighth Anniversary of the Communist Party of China, June 30, 1949|accessdate=2017-09-27}}</ref>).

Written by Affleck and Damon, the film follows 20-year-old [[South Boston]] janitor Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who, as part of a [[deferred prosecution]] agreement after assaulting a police officer, becomes a client of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend, his girlfriend, and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.\n\nThe film grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run, from a $10 million budget. For the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Oscars]] it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon.\n\nIn 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s \"100 Favorite Films\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting ([[Matt Damon]]) of [[South Boston]] is a self-taught genius, though he works as a janitor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Billy, and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Will flees when Lambeau catches him writing the solution on the blackboard late at night. At a bar, Will meets Skylar ([[Minnie Driver]]), a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].\n\nThe next day, Will and his friends fight a gang who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in therapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees, but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s, and after the first session where Sean threatens Will after he insults his deceased wife and a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.\n\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in love at first sight. Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\n\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day without looking back. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\n\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a rebuilt [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Will Hunting\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Sean Maguire\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Chuckie Sullivan\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Professor Gerald Lambeau\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Skylar\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Morgan O'Mally\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Billy McBride\n* [[John Mighton]] as Tom\n* [[Scott William Winters]] as Clark\n* [[Jimmy Flynn]] as Judge George H.

As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his ''Chasing Amy'' director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film.

Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including [[Mel Gibson]], [[Michael Mann]], and [[Steven Soderbergh]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a \"good director\" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director, but still served as one of the film's executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose [[Gus Van Sant]] for the job, whose work on previous films like ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters.

When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science [[P versus NP problem]], but the movie used other problems.

Written by Affleck and Damon, the film follows 20-year-old [[South Boston]] janitor Will Hunting, an unrecognized genius who, as part of a [[deferred prosecution]] agreement after assaulting a police officer, becomes a client of a therapist and studies advanced mathematics with a renowned professor. Through his therapy sessions, Will re-evaluates his relationships with his best friend, his girlfriend, and himself, facing the significant task of confronting his past and thinking about his future.\n\nThe film grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run, from a $10 million budget. For the [[70th Academy Awards|1998 Oscars]] it was nominated for nine [[Academy Awards]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and won two: [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Williams and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] for Affleck and Damon.\n\nIn 2014, it was ranked at number 53 in ''The Hollywood Reporter''{{'}}s \"100 Favorite Films\" list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/person/good-will-hunting|title=Best Hollywood Movies of All Time - Hollywood Reporter|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nTwenty-year-old Will Hunting ([[Matt Damon]]) of [[South Boston]] is a self-taught genius, though he works as a janitor at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and spends his free time drinking with his friends, Chuckie, Billy, and Morgan. When Professor Gerald Lambeau posts a difficult mathematics problem on a blackboard as a challenge for his graduate students, Will solves the problem anonymously, stunning both the students and Lambeau. As a challenge to the unknown genius, Lambeau posts an even more difficult problem. Will flees when Lambeau catches him writing the solution on the blackboard late at night. At a bar, Will meets Skylar ([[Minnie Driver]]), a British woman about to graduate from [[Harvard College]], who plans on attending medical school at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford]].\n\nThe next day, Will and his friends fight a gang who used to bully Will as a child. Will is arrested after he attacks a responding police officer. Lambeau sits in on his court appearance and watches Will defend himself. He arranges for him to avoid jail time if he agrees to study mathematics under Lambeau's supervision and participate in therapy sessions. Will tentatively agrees, but treats his therapists with mockery. In desperation, Lambeau calls on Dr. Sean Maguire, his college roommate, who now teaches psychology at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Unlike other therapists, Sean actually challenges Will's [[defense mechanism]]s, and after the first session where Sean threatens Will after he insults his deceased wife and a few unproductive sessions, Will begins to open up.\n\nWill is particularly struck by Sean's story of how he met his wife by giving up his ticket to the historic game six of the [[1975 World Series]], after falling in love at first sight. Sean does not regret his decision, even though his wife died of cancer. This encourages Will to build a relationship with Skylar, though he lies to her about his past and is reluctant to introduce her to his friends or show her his rundown neighborhood. Will also challenges Sean to take an objective look at his own life, since Sean cannot move on from his wife's death.\n\nLambeau sets up a number of job interviews for Will, but Will scorns them by sending Chuckie as his \"chief negotiator\", and by turning down a position at the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] with a scathing critique of the agency's moral position. Skylar asks Will to move to California with her, but he refuses and tells her he is an orphan, and that his foster father physically abused him. Will breaks up with Skylar and later storms out on Lambeau, dismissing the mathematical research he has been doing. Sean points out that Will is so adept at anticipating future failure in his interpersonal relationships that he deliberately sabotages them in order to avoid emotional pain. Chuckie likewise challenges Will over his resistance to taking any of the positions he interviews for, telling Will he owes it to his friends to make the most of opportunities they will never have, even if it means leaving one day without looking back. He then tells Will that the best part of his day is a brief moment when he waits on his doorstep thinking Will has moved on to something greater.\n\nWill walks in on a heated argument between Sean and Lambeau over his potential. Sean and Will share and find out that they were both victims of child abuse. Sean helps Will to see that he is a victim of his own inner demons and to accept that it is not his fault, causing him to break down in tears. Will accepts one of the job offers arranged by Lambeau. Having helped Will overcome his problems, Sean reconciles with Lambeau and decides to take a sabbatical. Will's friends present him with a rebuilt [[Chevrolet Nova]] for his 21st birthday. Later, Chuckie goes to Will's house to pick him up, only to find that he is not there, much to his happiness. Will sends Sean a letter telling him to tell Lambeau that he had to go \"see about a girl\", revealing he passed on the job offer and instead is heading to California to reunite with Skylar.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Matt Damon]] as Will Hunting\n* [[Robin Williams]] as Dr. Sean Maguire\n* [[Ben Affleck]] as Chuckie Sullivan\n* [[Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Professor Gerald Lambeau\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as Skylar\n* [[Casey Affleck]] as Morgan O'Mally\n* [[Cole Hauser]] as Billy McBride\n* [[John Mighton]] as Tom\n* [[Scott William Winters]] as Clark\n* [[Jimmy Flynn]] as Judge George H.

As a last resort, Affleck passed the script to his ''Chasing Amy'' director Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into [[Harvey Weinstein]]'s office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. In his recollection of the meeting, Weinstein asked about an out-of-place, mid-script [[oral sex]] scene, which Damon and Affleck explained was a test to see which studio executives had actually read the script.<ref>{{Cite AV media|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=623Es9ZYmt8&t=25s|title = Harvey Weinstein - The Graham Norton Show|date = Mar 15, 2015 |accessdate = |website = |publisher = BBC America|via= [[YouTube]] |last = |first = }}</ref><ref name=\"boston\" />\n[[File:Dunkin' Donuts, Cambridge, MA.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Baskin-Robbins]]/[[Dunkin' Donuts]], in front of which Will mocked Harvard student Clark (as seen in 2013; as of 2019, it is a ramen restaurant).]]\nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including [[Mel Gibson]], [[Michael Mann]], and [[Steven Soderbergh]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying they needed a \"good director\" and that he only directs things he writes and is not much of a visual director, but still served as one of the film's executive producers. Damon and Affleck later chose [[Gus Van Sant]] for the job, whose work on previous films like ''[[Drugstore Cowboy]]'' (1989) had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters.

Although the story is set in Boston, and many of the scenes were done on location in the Greater Boston area, much of the interior shots were filmed at locations in Toronto, with the [[University of Toronto]] standing in for [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University]]. The classroom scenes were filmed at McLennan Physical Laboratories (of the University of Toronto) and [[Central Technical School]].

When asked for a problem that Will could solve, Kleitman and Bohman suggested the unsolved computer science [[P versus NP problem]], but the movie used other problems.

known relative, ''[[Saccharina subsessilis]]'', together on the phylogenetic tree.<ref name=\":2\" /> ''Saccharina subessilis'' would become ''[[Hedophyllum subsessilis]]'' and be the lectotype

Hedophyllum genus have flexible stipes and lack tissue cavitation, true branching, and split branching.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Misidentification ===\nBecause the digitate blade of ''Laminaria nigripes'' is similar to the blade of ''Laminaria digitata''<ref name=\":6\" />, ''Laminaria nigripes'' samples are commonly misidentified as ''Laminaria digitata'' in the Maritime Provinces of Canada<ref name=\":4\" /> and the Northwest Atlantic which has contributed to fewer reportings of ''Laminaria nigripes'' in that region.<ref name=\":6\" /> Additionally, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is

S.C.Lindstrom & Martone 2019 :: Algaebase|website=www.algaebase.org|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> including ''Saccharina nigripes,<ref name=\":4\" /> Hedophyllum nigripes,<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Saccharina groelandica]],''<ref name=\":6\" /> and ''[[Laminaria bongardiana|Laminaria bongardiana.]]''<ref name=\":6\" />\n== Morphology ==\n=== Blades ===\n''Laminaria nigripes'' has two main phenotypes, one with a simple blade and one with a digitate blade.<ref name=\":6\" /> Both of these phenotypes are the same genetic species.<ref name=\":6\" /> The digitate bladed phenotypes is more common<ref name=\":6\" /> and can appear morphologically similar to Laminaria digitata while the simple bladed phenotype, which is much rarer, appears morphologically similar to Saccharina latissima.<ref name=\":6\" /> The presence of these phenotypes varies between the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic with a higher prevalence of the simple bladed phenotype in the Pacific than in the Atlantic.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because of the presence of multiple phenotypes, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is known to have phenotypic plasticity.<ref name=\":6\" /> When young, Laminaria nigripes has a stipe and bullated blades.<ref name=\":2\" /> As an individual matures, the stipe can be lost but may remain, and the blades often become smooth and cordate with lacerations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because the blades of Laminaria nigripes are prone to being torn by environmental factors, the blades can be split into multiple segments, but the blades do not experience split branching or trues branching.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Mucilage ducts ===\nThe presence of mucilage ducts varies between kelp species and has been used in the identification process, but pseudo mucilage ducts can be formed from infections and obscure the identification process.<ref name=\":4\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' can have mucilage ducts on the stipe or blades, and the presence of mucilage ducts in the cortex of the stipe for a cross section of a sample can be used to identify ''Laminaria nigripes'' individuals under a microscope.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, the mucilage ducts of ''Laminaria nigripes'' can become infected and appear as pseudo mucilage ducts, and mucilage ducts are less likely to be present in individuals from more northern, colder waters.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Range ==\nLaminaria nigripes is distributed in the North Atlantic and North Pacific,<ref name=\":0\" /> within Arctic, subarctic,<ref name=\":3\" /> and cold temperate<ref name=\":4\" /> waters. The range of ''Laminaria nigripes'' varies latitudinally between the Pacifica and Atlantic with records of the species in the waters around the southern end of British Columbia and a more northern distribution in the Atlantic.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the Northwest Atlantic, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is absent in Atlantic Nova Scotia, the Northumberland Strait of New Brunswick, Southern Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, some researches have claimed that ''Laminaria nigripes'' has distribution in subarctic but not Arctic waters.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' is recorded in Europe<ref name=\":0\" /> in addition to the Northwest Atlantic. There is some evidence that ''Laminaria nigripes'' plays an important ecological role in the Bay of Fundy, but researchers caution that more research needs to be done before the distribution of ''Laminaria nigripes'' in Atlantic Canada is clear.<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' is also found off of Greenland along with ''[[Saccharina latissima]]'', ''[[Laminaria solidungula]]'', ''[[Alaria esculenta]]'', ''[[Agarum clathratum]]'', ''[[Saccharina dermatodea]]'', and ''[[Saccharina logicruris]]''.<ref name=\":3\" /> In the Kara Sea, Laminaria nigripes is observed with ''Saccharina latissima'', ''[[Laminaria solidungula]]'', ''[[Alaria elliptica]]'', and ''[[Alaria oblonga]]''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe North Pacific has more endemic species of kelp than the North Atlantic<ref name=\":0\" /> and is believed to be where kelps as a whole began.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Saccharina clade likely began in the Northwest Pacific before moving into the Northeast Pacific and later into the Atlantic via passage through the Arctic.<ref name=\":5\" /> During the [[Cretaceous]] through [[Pleistocene]] eras, tectonic plate movements and glacial periods continually changed the seaways into and out of the Arctic.<ref name=\":0\" /> This resulted in a succession of different biotic exchanges between the Arctic and other ocean basins which resulted in the spreading of species across ocean basins and the creation of new species.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\nWithin its range, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is most often found in areas of rocky, intertidal zone with moderate to high wave action.<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' has to cope with and adjust to sea ice cover, low temperatures, and unique light conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> Abrasion, low light, low salinity, and low temperatures are common in areas like these which can have ice cover for part or all of the year.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ice cover is not static and creates abrasions in kelps as it moves.<ref name=\":3\" /> Ice cover also limits the light available for organisms beneath it by reflecting light, and the low availability of light affects photosynthetic activity.<ref name=\":3\" /> With the ice cover and high latitude of these areas, there is a wide range in the amount of light available at certain times for photosynthetic organisms, and there is a rapid increase of light available as the ice cover breaks up.<ref name=\":3\" /> This results in a limited season for ''Laminaria nigripes'' to grow.<ref name=\":3\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' may utilize the cold water of these areas to reproduce by spreading spores and to support early development.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because ''Laminaria nigripes'' prefers areas with moderate to high wave action, it shares that space with ''Laminaria digitata'' in the Bay of Fundy.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==[[Global warming|Climate change]]==\nThe mean summer [[Ocean warming|water temperatures]] in the Arctic are predicted to increase over the next century and have already increased in the past few decades.<ref name=\":3\" /> The rising temperatures will not affect all locations equally and could result in an increase or decrease of kelp production, shifts in competitive interactions, ecosystem changes, and an [[Introduced species|invasion of kelp]] from more southern lattitudes.<ref name=\":3\" /> The introduction of new kelp species has already begun in the regions where ''Laminaria nigripes'' lives.<ref name=\":5\" /> Additionally, the Arctic is rapidly losing [[Sea ice|sea ice cover]] which could aid in the invasion of more southern kelp species, narrow the vertical distribution of kelp, and make new spaces in the Arctic hospitable for kelp.<ref name=\":3\" /> As the ice cover melts, it dumps freshwater into the sea which lowers the salinity of the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Permafrost]] will also melt as ice melts, and the combination of the two will lead to land erosion and increased sediment in the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> As sediment in the water increases, sediment on the bottom of the ocean will increase, limiting the places where kelp can attach, and light and photosynthetic activity will be reduced by the suspension of sediment.<ref name=\":3\" /> As the ice cover melts, more UV radiation could enter the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> Nutrients in the water are predicted to increase which are likely to lead to an increase in the [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton blooms]] that block the light from reaching kelps, but it is unclear if any or all species of kelp would be directly affected by the nurtients.<ref name=\":3\" />  The effects of this would be more minor than other issues but could make photosynthesis difficult.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===''Laminaria nigripes'' example ===\nAt a study site, the presence of ''Laminaria nigripes'' decreased at the same time as sea surface temperatures in the area increased, and the decrease could not be attributed to heavy storms, increased competition, or salinity changes.<ref name=\":6\" /> When the sea surface temperatures returned to a more typical level, ''Laminaria nigripes'' did not recover.<ref name=\":6\" /> Kelps in general are affect by increased water temperatures because it disrupts their reproduction and development which may be why ''Laminaria nigripes'' decreased during a period of increase in sea surface temperatures.<ref name=\":6\" /> During certain life stages, ''Laminaria nigripes'' has an upper tolerance limit for temperature similar to that of Arctic species of kelp, and ''Laminaria nigripes'' could struggle if it is temperature sensitive and if temperatures contain to rise .<ref name=\":6\" />

often confused with ''Laminaria hyperborea'' in Europe.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition to the similar blade morphology, the difficulty of correctly identifying a sample via mucilage ducts has added further confusion.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because there is confusion around the identification of ''Laminaria nigripes'' and similar species,<ref name=\":1\" /> the genetic species of ''Laminaria nigripes'' has been referred to by multiple names<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.algaebase.org/search/species/detail/?species_id=172696&sk=0&from=results|title=Hedophyllum nigripes (J.Agardh) Starko, S.C.Lindstrom & Martone 2019 :: Algaebase|website=www.algaebase.org|access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> including ''Saccharina nigripes,<ref name=\":4\" /> Hedophyllum nigripes,<ref name=\":2\" /> [[Saccharina groelandica]],''<ref name=\":6\" /> and ''[[Laminaria bongardiana|Laminaria bongardiana.]]''<ref name=\":6\" />\n== Morphology ==\n=== Blades ===\n''Laminaria nigripes'' has two main phenotypes, one with a simple blade and one with a digitate blade.<ref name=\":6\" /> Both of these phenotypes are the same genetic species.<ref name=\":6\" /> The digitate bladed phenotypes is more common<ref name=\":6\" /> and can appear morphologically similar to Laminaria digitata while the simple bladed phenotype, which is much rarer, appears morphologically similar to Saccharina latissima.<ref name=\":6\" /> The presence of these phenotypes varies between the Northeast Pacific and Northwest Atlantic with a higher prevalence of the simple bladed phenotype in the Pacific than in the Atlantic.<ref name=\":4\" /> Because of the presence of multiple phenotypes, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is known to have phenotypic plasticity.<ref name=\":6\" /> When young, Laminaria nigripes has a stipe and bullated blades.<ref name=\":2\" /> As an individual matures, the stipe can be lost but may remain, and the blades often become smooth and cordate with lacerations.<ref name=\":2\" /> Because the blades of Laminaria nigripes are prone to being torn by environmental factors, the blades can be split into multiple segments, but the blades do not experience split branching or trues branching.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Mucilage ducts ===\nThe presence of mucilage ducts varies between kelp species and has been used in the identification process, but pseudo mucilage ducts can be formed from infections and obscure the identification process.<ref name=\":4\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' can have mucilage ducts on the stipe or blades, and the presence of mucilage ducts in the cortex of the stipe for a cross section of a sample can be used to identify ''Laminaria nigripes'' individuals under a microscope.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, the mucilage ducts of ''Laminaria nigripes'' can become infected and appear as pseudo mucilage ducts, and mucilage ducts are less likely to be present in individuals from more northern, colder waters.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Range ==\nLaminaria nigripes is distributed in the North Atlantic and North Pacific,<ref name=\":0\" /> within Arctic, subarctic,<ref name=\":3\" /> and cold temperate<ref name=\":4\" /> waters. The range of ''Laminaria nigripes'' varies latitudinally between the Pacifica and Atlantic with records of the species in the waters around the southern end of British Columbia and a more northern distribution in the Atlantic.<ref name=\":4\" /> In the Northwest Atlantic, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is absent in Atlantic Nova Scotia, the Northumberland Strait of New Brunswick, Southern Maine, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.<ref name=\":4\" /> Additionally, some researches have claimed that ''Laminaria nigripes'' has distribution in subarctic but not Arctic waters.<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' is recorded in Europe<ref name=\":0\" /> in addition to the Northwest Atlantic. There is some evidence that ''Laminaria nigripes'' plays an important ecological role in the Bay of Fundy, but researchers caution that more research needs to be done before the distribution of ''Laminaria nigripes'' in Atlantic Canada is clear.<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' is also found off of Greenland along with ''[[Saccharina latissima]]'', ''[[Laminaria solidungula]]'', ''[[Alaria esculenta]]'', ''[[Agarum clathratum]]'', ''[[Saccharina dermatodea]]'', and ''[[Saccharina logicruris]]''.<ref name=\":3\" /> In the Kara Sea, Laminaria nigripes is observed with ''Saccharina latissima'', ''[[Laminaria solidungula]]'', ''[[Alaria elliptica]]'', and ''[[Alaria oblonga]]''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Evolution ===\nThe North Pacific has more endemic species of kelp than the North Atlantic<ref name=\":0\" /> and is believed to be where kelps as a whole began.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Saccharina clade likely began in the Northwest Pacific before moving into the Northeast Pacific and later into the Atlantic via passage through the Arctic.<ref name=\":5\" /> During the [[Cretaceous]] through [[Pleistocene]] eras, tectonic plate movements and glacial periods continually changed the seaways into and out of the Arctic.<ref name=\":0\" /> This resulted in a succession of different biotic exchanges between the Arctic and other ocean basins which resulted in the spreading of species across ocean basins and the creation of new species.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Habitat ==\nWithin its range, ''Laminaria nigripes'' is most often found in areas of rocky, intertidal zone with moderate to high wave action.<ref name=\":6\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' has to cope with and adjust to sea ice cover, low temperatures, and unique light conditions.<ref name=\":3\" /> Abrasion, low light, low salinity, and low temperatures are common in areas like these which can have ice cover for part or all of the year.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ice cover is not static and creates abrasions in kelps as it moves.<ref name=\":3\" /> Ice cover also limits the light available for organisms beneath it by reflecting light, and the low availability of light affects photosynthetic activity.<ref name=\":3\" /> With the ice cover and high latitude of these areas, there is a wide range in the amount of light available at certain times for photosynthetic organisms, and there is a rapid increase of light available as the ice cover breaks up.<ref name=\":3\" /> This results in a limited season for ''Laminaria nigripes'' to grow.<ref name=\":3\" /> ''Laminaria nigripes'' may utilize the cold water of these areas to reproduce by spreading spores and to support early development.<ref name=\":6\" /> Because ''Laminaria nigripes'' prefers areas with moderate to high wave action, it shares that space with ''Laminaria digitata'' in the Bay of Fundy.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==[[Global warming|Climate change]]==\nThe mean summer [[Ocean warming|water temperatures]] in the Arctic are predicted to increase over the next century and have already increased in the past few decades.<ref name=\":3\" /> The rising temperatures will not affect all locations equally and could result in an increase or decrease of kelp production, shifts in competitive interactions, ecosystem changes, and an [[Introduced species|invasion of kelp]] from more southern lattitudes.<ref name=\":3\" /> The introduction of new kelp species has already begun in the regions where ''Laminaria nigripes'' lives.<ref name=\":5\" /> Additionally, the Arctic is rapidly losing [[Sea ice|sea ice cover]] which could aid in the invasion of more southern kelp species, narrow the vertical distribution of kelp, and make new spaces in the Arctic hospitable for kelp.<ref name=\":3\" /> As the ice cover melts, it dumps freshwater into the sea which lowers the salinity of the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[Permafrost]] will also melt as ice melts, and the combination of the two will lead to land erosion and increased sediment in the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> As sediment in the water increases, sediment on the bottom of the ocean will increase, limiting the places where kelp can attach, and light and photosynthetic activity will be reduced by the suspension of sediment.<ref name=\":3\" /> As the ice cover melts, more UV radiation could enter the water.<ref name=\":3\" /> Nutrients in the water are predicted to increase which are likely to lead to an increase in the [[Algal bloom|phytoplankton blooms]] that block the light from reaching kelps, but it is unclear if any or all species of kelp would be directly affected by the nurtients.<ref name=\":3\" />  The effects of this would be more minor than other issues but could make photosynthesis difficult.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===''Laminaria nigripes'' example ===\nAt a study site, the presence of ''Laminaria nigripes'' decreased at the same time as sea surface temperatures in the area increased, and the decrease could not be attributed to heavy storms, increased competition, or salinity changes.<ref name=\":6\" /> When the sea surface temperatures returned to a more typical level, ''Laminaria nigripes'' did not recover.<ref name=\":6\" /> Kelps in general are affect by increased water temperatures because it disrupts their reproduction and development which may be why ''Laminaria nigripes'' decreased during a period of increase in sea surface temperatures.<ref name=\":6\" /> During certain life stages, ''Laminaria nigripes'' has an upper tolerance limit for temperature similar to that of Arctic species of kelp, and ''Laminaria nigripes'' could struggle if it is temperature sensitive and if temperatures contain to rise .<ref name=\":6\" />

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is {{convert|35|km}} north of [[Manila]].\n\nBulakan, which is one of the oldest towns in the Philippines, became the ''encomienda'' or capital of the ''[[Pampanga|Provincia de la Pampanga]]'', and later became the first capital of the [[Province of Bulacan]] before it was moved to [[Malolos]] shortly after the American occupation.\n\nWith regards to whether to use the letters \"c\" or \"k\" to refer to the municipality of Bulakan, the New Provincial Administrative Code of Bulacan (Ordinance no. C-004) of 2007 states on Chapter 2, Section 15 that the word \"Bulakan\" stands for the municipality and first capital of the province while \"Bulacan\" refers to the province itself.<ref name=\"Name change to Bulakan\">{{cite web|title=New Provincial Administrative Code of Bulacan|url=http://rightonthemark.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/new-provincial-administrative-code-of-bulacan_2.pdf|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Manila International Airport]] is being proposed to be built the coastlines of the municipality with target completion of 2025.\n\n== History ==\nThe name \"Bulakan\" is derived from the Tagalog word \"bulak\", which means \"cotton\". The town was named Bulacan due to the abundance of cotton plants growing in the region.\n\nThe Augustinians founded Bulakan as one of the ''visitas'' of Convento de Tondo in 1575 under its minister Fray Alonzo Alvarado, OSA. In 1578 it became a town Parish and Convent dedicated it under the patronage of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n with Caluya (now [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], became town in 1599) and [[Guiguinto, Bulacan|Guiguinto]] (became town in 1641) as its ''visitas''.<ref>Administracion espiritual de los Padres Agustinos Calzados de la provincia del dulce Nombre de Jesus, by R. P. Fr. Fracisco Villacorta, Imprenta de H. Roldan Valladolid, Mayo 1833 p. 39</ref> According to local records, Father Agustin del Alburqueque, OSA is the first Prior of the Town.<ref>Catalogo de los religiosos de N.P.S. Agustin de la Provincia del Smo Nombre de Jesus de Filipinas, Imp. De Ramirez Y Giraudier, Manila 1864.  p. 11</ref>\n\nIn a census of June 1591, the [[Province of Bulacan]] had 1,200 tributes or 4,800 persons, one Augustinian convent, one ''Gobernadorcillo'' and one ''alcalde mayor'' (present day governor) who had jurisdiction over the towns of Bulakan (then capital) [[Malolos]], [[Calumpit]], Guiguinto, Caluya and [[Meycauayan]].\n\nIn the heart of the town stands the centuries-old adobe church of Our Lady of the Assumption ''(Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n)''. In front of the church stands the municipal hall and a park named ''\"Plaza del Pilar\"'', which is dedicated to Revolutionary General [[Gregorio del Pilar]] who hailed from Barangay San Jose, Bulakan.\n\nThe [[Our Lady of Assumption Church (Bulakan)|Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption]] is the second oldest Roman Catholic church in the province and the longest and widest in terms of aisle length and span respectively. It has a baptismal book entry as early as 1578. On the first page of the book, written was the name of the barrio of the town of Bulacan, Bagio, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Matungao, Cupang, Banban, Dapdap, Parian, Balubad, Pitpitan, Maysantor, Acsajo, Paniqui, San Nicolas, Nagdasig, Calungusan, Taliktik and Sta Ana.\n\nAfter 400 long years, changes have been made to the old ''barrios'' that consist the town. Bagio became part of Bagumbayan in 1731, Tibig exist in 1735, Dapdap was renamed Santa Ana in 1741, Nagdasig become part of Tab-Ang in 1744 and now San Francisco, Parian was renamed Santa Inez in 1765, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Paniqui and Calungusan was created into one barrio and was named San Jose, Barrio Pitpitan occupied Acsajo, Cupang was joined to Maysantor now Maysantol, Banban became Bangbang and now Bambang, Perez exists as separate ''barrio'' of Taliktik (now Taliptip), and with the same old name of ''barrios'' San Nicolas, Matungao and Balubad.\n\nThe early Bulaque\u00f1os, the residents of Bulakan, were engaged in farming, fishing and handicrafts, especially weaving.\n\nThe town of Bulakan, being the first capital of the province, gave the name to the province as customary to the other provinces of the early Philippines (like [[Cavite, Cavite]]; Tayabas, Tayabas (now [[Quezon Province]]) or [[Batangas, Batangas]]). It was the hub of economic activities and the inhabitants enjoyed excellent trade with [[Manila]], primarily due to its proximity to the city and accessibility through its wide and navigable river.\n\nBulakan was also the scene of battle between the Spaniards led by Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar and the British led by Captain Slay during the short [[British occupation of Manila]]. The British sent an expedition of 400 British, 300 Malabar Negroes and 2,000 Chinese allies. The Spaniards, with the natives of Bulacan, made a gallant stand but were defeated. Captain Slay eventually took over the town but did not last long.\n\nA huge group of about 8,000 Filipino guerillas led by Spanish Jose Pedro de Busto made a nine long days battle in front of the church up to the foot bridge against Captain Slay. They made Captain Slay to retreat to Manila. On this fight, Bulaque\u00f1os have shown for the first time an extraordinary martyrdom. The British attempt of conquering the rest of the country was gone astray because of the marvelous fight made by Bulake\u00f1os. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asuncion is the birthplace of Flores de Mayo, a feast for the Virgin Mary, held throughout the Philippines in the month of May. It is also the birthplace of the traditional song ''Dalit'', a poetic chant for the patrons of a certain ''barrio'' or town. For centuries, the Church of the Our Lady of the Assumption served as the bastion of the Catholic faith all over the province. It served as the central church: a cathedral-like church serving as a primus inter pares among the Poblacion churches of Bulakan. After the erection of the [[Diocese of Malolos]], its former glory slowly faded as the focus turned to the cathedral of the neighboring town Malolos: a church erected 2 years later in 1580. As the former capital of the secular rule, as well as the fortress of Christianity, it is due to give honor to this century-old church. Thus, the faithful along with the incumbent parish priest, Rev. Fr. Manuel Manicad, petitioned a request to the bishop, His Excellency Jose Francisco Oliveros, Bishop of Malolos, to declare the church as a Diocesan Shrine. Up until now, there is no response from the Diocesan Curia. The town still enjoys trade and commerce with the neighboring towns and Manila with whom she shares a coastline, a place that is replete with historical and glorious past.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe municipality of Bulakan lies in the southwestern part of the province of [[Bulacan]] and is surrounded by a number of municipalities.  It is bounded on the north by the Municipality of [[Guiguinto]], on the south by the [[Manila Bay]], on the east by the Municipality of [[Bocaue]], on the west by the City of [[Malolos]], on the northeast by the Municipality of [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Balagtas]], on the southwest by the City of [[Meycauayan]] and on the southeast by the Municipality of [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]].\n\nIt is about {{Convert|35|km}} away from the [[City of Manila]].

In front of the church stands the municipal hall and a park named ''\"Plaza del Pilar\"'', which is dedicated to Revolutionary General [[Gregorio del Pilar]] who hailed from Barangay San Jose, Bulakan.\n\nThe [[Our Lady of Assumption Church (Bulakan)|Parish Church of Our Lady of the Assumption]] is the second oldest Roman Catholic church in the province and the longest and widest in terms of aisle length and span respectively. It has a baptismal book entry as early as 1578. On the first page of the book, written was the name of the barrio of the town of Bulacan, Bagio, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Matungao, Cupang, Banban, Dapdap, Parian, Balubad, Pitpitan, Maysantor, Acsajo, Paniqui, San Nicolas, Nagdasig, Calungusan, Taliktik and Sta Ana.\n\nAfter 400 long years, changes have been made to the old ''barrios'' that consist the town. Bagio became part of Bagumbayan in 1731, Tibig exist in 1735, Dapdap was renamed Santa Ana in 1741, Nagdasig become part of Tab-Ang in 1744 and now San Francisco, Parian was renamed Santa Inez in 1765, Bulacan (Camino Real), Daan Estacion, Paniqui and Calungusan was created into one barrio and was named San Jose, Barrio Pitpitan occupied Acsajo, Cupang was joined to Maysantor now Maysantol, Banban became Bangbang and now Bambang, Perez exists as separate ''barrio'' of Taliktik (now Taliptip), and with the same old name of ''barrios'' San Nicolas, Matungao and Balubad.\n\nThe early Bulaque\u00f1os, the residents of Bulakan, were engaged in farming, fishing and handicrafts, especially weaving.\n\nThe town of Bulakan, being the first capital of the province, gave the name to the province as customary to the other provinces of the early Philippines (like [[Cavite, Cavite]]; Tayabas, Tayabas (now [[Quezon Province]]) or [[Batangas, Batangas]]). It was the hub of economic activities and the inhabitants enjoyed excellent trade with [[Manila]], primarily due to its proximity to the city and accessibility through its wide and navigable river.\n\nBulakan was also the scene of battle between the Spaniards led by Sim\u00f3n de Anda y Salazar and the British led by Captain Slay during the short [[British occupation of Manila]]. The British sent an expedition of 400 British, 300 Malabar Negroes and 2,000 Chinese allies. The Spaniards, with the natives of Bulacan, made a gallant stand but were defeated. Captain Slay eventually took over the town but did not last long.\n\nA huge group of about 8,000 Filipino guerillas led by Spanish Jose Pedro de Busto made a nine long days battle in front of the church up to the foot bridge against Captain Slay. They made Captain Slay to retreat to Manila. On this fight, Bulaque\u00f1os have shown for the first time an extraordinary martyrdom. The British attempt of conquering the rest of the country was gone astray because of the marvelous fight made by Bulake\u00f1os. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asuncion is the birthplace of Flores de Mayo, a feast for the Virgin Mary, held throughout the Philippines in the month of May. It is also the birthplace of the traditional song ''Dalit'', a poetic chant for the patrons of a certain ''barrio'' or town. For centuries, the Church of the Our Lady of the Assumption served as the bastion of the Catholic faith all over the province. It served as the central church: a cathedral-like church serving as a primus inter pares among the Poblacion churches of Bulakan. After the erection of the [[Diocese of Malolos]], its former glory slowly faded as the focus turned to the cathedral of the neighboring town Malolos: a church erected 2 years later in 1580. As the former capital of the secular rule, as well as the fortress of Christianity, it is due to give honor to this century-old church. Thus, the faithful along with the incumbent parish priest, Rev. Fr. Manuel Manicad, petitioned a request to the bishop, His Excellency Jose Francisco Oliveros, Bishop of Malolos, to declare the church as a Diocesan Shrine. Up until now, there is no response from the Diocesan Curia. The town still enjoys trade and commerce with the neighboring towns and Manila with whom she shares a coastline, a place that is replete with historical and glorious past.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe municipality of Bulakan lies in the southwestern part of the province of [[Bulacan]] and is surrounded by a number of municipalities.
