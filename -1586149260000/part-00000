They recorded their first album after only five months as a band, and with only three live shows to their credit.\nTheir self-titled first album was released in January 2005 by a small Swedish indie label; it was rereleased in September 2006 by V2 Music with an additional three tracks.\n\nTheir second album, ''[[All They Ever Wanted]]'', had its Scandinavian and Western European release in April 2008, followed by a Japanese release in 2009.\n\nJohnossi has toured extensively in Sweden and Western Europe, both alone and with other Swedish bands such as [[The Soundtrack of Our Lives]], [[Mando Diao]] and [[Sibling Sense]]. They also toured the US in 2007 with [[Shout Out Louds]].

In plants, these proteins are held inside [[organelle]]s called [[chloroplast]]s, which are most abundant in leaf cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the [[plasma membrane]]. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip [[electron]]s from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]] (NADPH) and [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), the \"energy currency\" of cells.\n\nIn plants, algae and cyanobacteria, long-term energy storage in the form of sugars is produced by a subsequent sequence of {{nobreak|light-independent}} reactions called the [[Calvin cycle]]; some bacteria use different mechanisms, such as the [[reverse Krebs cycle]], to achieve the same end.

However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; [[photoheterotroph]]s use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.<ref name=bryantfrigaard/> In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This is called '''oxygenic photosynthesis''' and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in [[plants]], [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.\n\nCarbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called [[carbon fixation]]; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into [[carbohydrate]]. Carbon fixation is an [[endothermic]] [[redox]] reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of [[cellular respiration]]: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other [[nutrient]]s to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids.

A typical [[plant cell]] contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and [[peripheral membrane protein]] complexes of the photosynthetic system.\n\nPlants absorb light primarily using the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]]. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color.

In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together.

Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and [[arid]]ity, such as many ''[[Euphorbia]]'' and [[cactus]] species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]], can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant [[wax]]y [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] that protects the leaf from excessive [[evaporation]] of water and decreases the absorption of [[ultraviolet]] or [[blue]] [[light]] to reduce [[heat]]ing. The transparent [[Leaf#Epidermis|epidermis]] layer allows light to pass through to the [[Mesophyll tissue|palisade]] mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.\n\n==Light-dependent reactions==\n[[File:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|450px|right|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]\n{{Main|Light-dependent reactions}}\nIn the [[light-dependent reactions]], one molecule of the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]] absorbs one [[photon]] and loses one [[electron]]. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called [[pheophytin]], which passes the electron to a [[quinone]] molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an [[electron transport chain]] that leads to the ultimate reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]] to [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]. In addition, this creates a [[Electrochemical gradient|proton gradient]] (energy gradient) across the [[chloroplast membrane]], which is used by [[ATP synthase]] in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called [[Photodissociation|photolysis]], which releases a [[dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) molecule as a waste product.\n\nThe overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:<ref name=\"Raven\">{{cite book |vauthors=Raven PH, Evert RF, Eichhorn SE |title=Biology of Plants |url=https://archive.org/details/biologyofplants00rave_0 |url-access=registration |edition=7th |publisher=[[W.

The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of [[accessory pigment]]s present. For example, in green plants, the [[action spectrum]] resembles the [[absorption spectrum]] for [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoid]]s with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum  is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]] is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.\n\n===Z scheme===\n[[File:Z-scheme.png|thumb|675px|center|The \"Z scheme\"]]\nIn plants, [[light-dependent reaction]]s occur in the [[thylakoid membrane]]s of the [[chloroplast]]s where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.\n\nIn the non-cyclic reaction, the [[photon]]s are captured in the light-harvesting [[antenna complex]]es of [[Photosystem|photosystem II]] by [[chlorophyll]] and other [[accessory pigments]] (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called [[photoinduced charge separation]]. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] (the so-called '''''Z-scheme''''' shown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] by pumping proton cations (H<sup>+</sup>) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An [[ATP synthase]] enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during [[photophosphorylation]], whereas [[NADPH]] is a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction in the ''Z-scheme''. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in [[Photosystem I]]. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that [[photosystem]]. The electron is then passed along a chain of [[electron acceptor]]s to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H<sup>+</sup> to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.\n\nThe cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name ''cyclic reaction''.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{Main|Photodissociation|Oxygen evolution}}\nLinear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of [[photosystem I]] are replaced by transfer from [[plastocyanin]], whose electrons come from electron transport through [[photosystem II]]. Photosystem II, as the first step of the ''Z-scheme'', requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized '''chlorophyll ''a''''' reaction center, called P680. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria  is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic [[oxygen]] and four [[hydrogen]] ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active [[tyrosine]] residue that then reduces the oxidized P680. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four [[manganese]] ions and a calcium ion; this [[oxygen-evolving complex]] binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams). Photosystem II is the only known biological [[enzyme]] that carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], including photosynthetic organisms.<ref name=\"VK Yachandra\">{{Cite web|url=https://www2.lbl.gov/vkyachan/|title=Yachandra/Yano Group - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|website=www2.lbl.gov|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722054431/https://www2.lbl.gov/vkyachan/|archive-date=2019-07-22|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid18250316\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pushkar Y, Yano J, Sauer K, Boussac A, Yachandra VK |title=Structural changes in the Mn4Ca cluster and the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1879\u20131884 |date=Feb 2008 |pmid=18250316 |pmc=2542863 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707092105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.1879P }}</ref>\n\n==Light-independent reactions==\n\n===Calvin cycle===\n{{Main|Light-independent reactions|Carbon fixation}}\nIn the [[light-independent reactions|light-independent]] (or \"dark\") reactions, the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] captures [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and, in a process called the [[Calvin cycle]], it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch.

The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material [[cellulose]], the precursors for [[lipid]] and [[amino acid]] biosynthesis, or as a fuel in [[cellular respiration]]. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in [[animal]]s when the energy from plants is passed through a [[food chain]].\n\nThe fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which [[carbon dioxide]] combines with a five-carbon sugar, [[ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]], to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde ([[PGAL]]) or, more generically, as [[triose]] phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form [[hexose]] phosphates, which ultimately yield [[sucrose]], [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]. The sugars produced during carbon [[metabolism]] yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].\n\n===Carbon concentrating mechanisms===\n\n====On land====\n[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of [[C4 carbon fixation]]]]\nIn hot and dry conditions, plants close their [[stomata]] to prevent water loss.

In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called [[chromophore]]s arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a [[quasiparticle]] referred to as an [[exciton]], which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.<ref name=\"urlBBC News - Plants seen doing quantum physics\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 |title=Plants 'seen doing quantum physics' |journal=BBC News |vauthors=Palmer J |date=21 June 2013 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003013809/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 |archive-date=3 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"urlQuantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ |title=Quantum Biology: Better living through quantum mechanics |series=The Nature of Reality |vauthors=Lloyd S |date=10 March 2014 |publisher=Nova: PBS Online; WGBH Boston |access-date=8 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703071034/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ |archive-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23788794\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildner R, Brinks D, Nieder JB, Cogdell RJ, van Hulst NF |title=Quantum coherent energy transfer over varying pathways in single light-harvesting complexes |journal=Science |volume=340 |issue=6139 |pages=1448\u20131451 |date=June 2013 |pmid=23788794 |doi=10.1126/science.1235820 |bibcode=2013Sci...340.1448H}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{main|Evolution of photosynthesis}}\n\nEarly photosynthetic systems, such as those in [[Green sulfur bacteria|green]] and [[purple sulfur]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green]] and [[purple nonsulfur bacteria]], are thought to have been [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]], and used various other molecules than water as [[electron donor]]s.

The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450\u20132320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomitani A, Knoll AH, Cavanaugh CM, Ohno T | title = The evolutionary diversification of cyanobacteria: molecular-phylogenetic and paleontological perspectives | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 14 | pages = 5442\u20135447 | date = Apr 2006 | pmid = 16569695 | pmc = 1459374 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600999103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.5442T }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html |title=Cyanobacteria: Fossil Record |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824004835/http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanofr.html |archive-date=2010-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen.<ref>{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Alison | name-list-format = vanc | title = Plant biology | publisher = Garland Science | location = New York | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-8153-4025-6 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=eC0WBAAAQBAJ|page=5}}| page = 5 }}</ref> Available evidence from geobiological studies of [[Archean]] (>2500 Ma) [[sedimentary rock]]s indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered.

After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate \u2013 much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.\n\n[[Joseph Priestley]], a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO<sub>2</sub>), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly [[Breathing|\"injure\"]] air. He then showed that the air that had been \"injured\" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant.\n\nIn 1778, [[Jan Ingenhousz]], repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.\n\nIn 1796, [[Jean Senebier]], a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, [[Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure]] showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.<ref>[[Eugene Rabinowitch]] (1945) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/26615#page/9/mode/1up Photosynthesis and Related Processes] via [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]</ref>\n\n[[Cornelis Van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen [[Reducing agent|reduces]] (donates its <sup>\u2013</sup> electron to) carbon dioxide.\n\n[[Robert Emerson (scientist)|Robert Emerson]] discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600&nbsp;nm wavelengths, the other up to 700&nbsp;nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigment. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.<ref name=\"ps\"/>\n\n[[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]] thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b<sub>6</sub> (now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated [[chloroplast]]s give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like [[iron]] [[oxalate]], [[ferricyanide]] or [[benzoquinone]] after exposure to light.

At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.\n\n<!--[[File:carbon a t.jpg|thumb|Carbon assimilation at a constant temperature.]] unsourced graph with swapped axis titles -->\nThese two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, [[photochemical]] reactions are not affected by [[temperature]]. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent 'photochemical']] temperature-independent stage, and the [[Light-independent reaction|light-independent, temperature-dependent]] stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of [[limiting factor]]s. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center. This unit is called a [[phycobilisome]].{{clarify|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration===\n[[File:Photorespiration.svg|thumb|350px|Photorespiration]]\nAs carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the [[light-independent reaction]]s increases until limited by other factors. [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will [[Carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]]. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called [[photorespiration]], uses energy, but does not produce sugars.\n\nRuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:\n# One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]].\n# Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.\n# Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), which is able to [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.\n\n::A highly simplified summary is:\n\n:::2 glycolate + ATP \u2192 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as [[photorespiration]], since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Metabolism}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jan Anderson (scientist)]]\n* [[Artificial photosynthesis]]\n* [[Calvin-Benson cycle]]\n* [[Carbon fixation]]\n* [[Cellular respiration]]\n* [[Chemosynthesis]]\n* [[Daily light integral]]\n* [[Hill reaction]]\n* [[Integrated fluorometer]]\n* [[Light-dependent reaction]]\n* [[Organic reaction]]\n* [[Photobiology]]\n* [[Photoinhibition]]\n* [[Photosynthetic reaction center]]\n* [[Photosynthetically active radiation]]\n* [[Photosystem]]\n* [[Photosystem I]]\n* [[Photosystem II]]\n* [[Quantum biology]]\n* [[Radiosynthesis (metabolism)|Radiosynthesis]]\n* [[Red edge]]\n* [[Vitamin D]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box\n|by=no\n|onlinebooks=no\n|others=no\n|about=yes\n|label=Photosynthesis}}\n\n===Books===\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Bidlack JE, Stern KR, Jansky S | title = Introductory Plant Biology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-07-290941-8 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Blankenship RE | title = Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8975-0 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jQztAgAAQBAJ}}}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Govindjee, Beatty JT, Gest H, Allen JF | title = Discoveries in Photosynthesis | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2006 | series = Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration | volume = 20 | isbn = 978-1-4020-3323-0 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=I3gy4r-aBusC}}}}\n* {{cite book  |vauthors=Reece JB, etal | title = Campbell Biology | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]] | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-321-77565-8 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Papers===\n{{refbegin|33em}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta RS, Mukhtar T, Singh B | title = Evolutionary relationships among photosynthetic prokaryotes (''Heliobacterium chlorum'', ''Chloroflexus aurantiacus'', cyanobacteria, ''Chlorobium tepidum'' and proteobacteria): implications regarding the origin of photosynthesis | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 893\u2013906 | date = Jun 1999 | pmid = 10361294 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01417.x}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Rutherford AW, Faller P | title = Photosystem II: evolutionary perspectives | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

This is called '''oxygenic photosynthesis''' and is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in [[plants]], [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]], the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], used mostly by certain types of bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.\n\nCarbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called [[carbon fixation]]; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into [[carbohydrate]]. Carbon fixation is an [[endothermic]] [[redox]] reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of [[cellular respiration]]: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrate, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrate or other [[nutrient]]s to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's [[metabolism]]. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different [[cellular compartment]]s.\n\nThe general [[chemical equation|equation]] for photosynthesis as first proposed by [[C.

This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks.

Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and [[arid]]ity, such as many ''[[Euphorbia]]'' and [[cactus]] species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the [[mesophyll tissue|mesophyll]], can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant [[wax]]y [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]] that protects the leaf from excessive [[evaporation]] of water and decreases the absorption of [[ultraviolet]] or [[blue]] [[light]] to reduce [[heat]]ing. The transparent [[Leaf#Epidermis|epidermis]] layer allows light to pass through to the [[Mesophyll tissue|palisade]] mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.\n\n==Light-dependent reactions==\n[[File:Thylakoid membrane 3.svg|thumb|450px|right|Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane]]\n{{Main|Light-dependent reactions}}\nIn the [[light-dependent reactions]], one molecule of the [[pigment]] [[chlorophyll]] absorbs one [[photon]] and loses one [[electron]]. This electron is passed to a modified form of chlorophyll called [[pheophytin]], which passes the electron to a [[quinone]] molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an [[electron transport chain]] that leads to the ultimate reduction of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADP]] to [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]]. In addition, this creates a [[Electrochemical gradient|proton gradient]] (energy gradient) across the [[chloroplast membrane]], which is used by [[ATP synthase]] in the synthesis of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called [[Photodissociation|photolysis]], which releases a [[dioxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>) molecule as a waste product.\n\nThe overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:<ref name=\"Raven\">{{cite book |vauthors=Raven PH, Evert RF, Eichhorn SE |title=Biology of Plants |url=https://archive.org/details/biologyofplants00rave_0 |url-access=registration |edition=7th |publisher=[[W.

The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of [[accessory pigment]]s present. For example, in green plants, the [[action spectrum]] resembles the [[absorption spectrum]] for [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoid]]s with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum  is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the [[Electromagnetic spectrum|light spectrum]] is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.\n\n===Z scheme===\n[[File:Z-scheme.png|thumb|675px|center|The \"Z scheme\"]]\nIn plants, [[light-dependent reaction]]s occur in the [[thylakoid membrane]]s of the [[chloroplast]]s where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.\n\nIn the non-cyclic reaction, the [[photon]]s are captured in the light-harvesting [[antenna complex]]es of [[Photosystem|photosystem II]] by [[chlorophyll]] and other [[accessory pigments]] (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex frees an electron by a process called [[photoinduced charge separation]]. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That freed electron is transferred to the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an [[Electron transfer chain|electron transport chain]] (the so-called '''''Z-scheme''''' shown in the diagram), it initially functions to generate a [[chemiosmotic potential]] by pumping proton cations (H<sup>+</sup>) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An [[ATP synthase]] enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during [[photophosphorylation]], whereas [[NADPH]] is a product of the terminal [[redox]] reaction in the ''Z-scheme''. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in [[Photosystem I]]. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that [[photosystem]]. The electron is then passed along a chain of [[electron acceptor]]s to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the co-enzyme NADP with a H<sup>+</sup> to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.\n\nThe cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic, but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name ''cyclic reaction''.\n\n===Water photolysis===\n{{Main|Photodissociation|Oxygen evolution}}\nLinear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of [[photosystem I]] are replaced by transfer from [[plastocyanin]], whose electrons come from electron transport through [[photosystem II]]. Photosystem II, as the first step of the ''Z-scheme'', requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized '''chlorophyll ''a''''' reaction center, called P680. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria  is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by four successive charge-separation reactions by photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic [[oxygen]] and four [[hydrogen]] ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active [[tyrosine]] residue that then reduces the oxidized P680. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is [[catalysis|catalyzed]] in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four [[manganese]] ions and a calcium ion; this [[oxygen-evolving complex]] binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Dolai's S-state diagrams). Photosystem II is the only known biological [[enzyme]] that carries out this oxidation of water. The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen for [[cellular respiration]], including photosynthetic organisms.<ref name=\"VK Yachandra\">{{Cite web|url=https://www2.lbl.gov/vkyachan/|title=Yachandra/Yano Group - Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|website=www2.lbl.gov|access-date=2019-07-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722054431/https://www2.lbl.gov/vkyachan/|archive-date=2019-07-22|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid18250316\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pushkar Y, Yano J, Sauer K, Boussac A, Yachandra VK |title=Structural changes in the Mn4Ca cluster and the mechanism of photosynthetic water splitting |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1879\u20131884 |date=Feb 2008 |pmid=18250316 |pmc=2542863 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0707092105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.1879P }}</ref>\n\n==Light-independent reactions==\n\n===Calvin cycle===\n{{Main|Light-independent reactions|Carbon fixation}}\nIn the [[light-independent reactions|light-independent]] (or \"dark\") reactions, the [[enzyme]] [[RuBisCO]] captures [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and, in a process called the [[Calvin cycle]], it uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch.

The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used in the forming of other organic compounds, such as the building material [[cellulose]], the precursors for [[lipid]] and [[amino acid]] biosynthesis, or as a fuel in [[cellular respiration]]. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in [[animal]]s when the energy from plants is passed through a [[food chain]].\n\nThe fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which [[carbon dioxide]] combines with a five-carbon sugar, [[ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate]], to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[NADPH]] produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde ([[PGAL]]) or, more generically, as [[triose]] phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus \"recycled\" often condense to form [[hexose]] phosphates, which ultimately yield [[sucrose]], [[starch]] and [[cellulose]]. The sugars produced during carbon [[metabolism]] yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of [[amino acids]] and [[lipids]].\n\n===Carbon concentrating mechanisms===\n\n====On land====\n[[File:HatchSlackpathway2.svg|thumb|right|400px|Overview of [[C4 carbon fixation]]]]\nIn hot and dry conditions, plants close their [[stomata]] to prevent water loss.

In the photosynthetic cell of an algae, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called [[chromophore]]s arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a [[quasiparticle]] referred to as an [[exciton]], which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form that makes it accessible for the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously \"choose\" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances, due to obstacles in the form of destructive interference that come into play. These obstacles cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic \"hop\". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.<ref name=\"urlBBC News - Plants seen doing quantum physics\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 |title=Plants 'seen doing quantum physics' |journal=BBC News |vauthors=Palmer J |date=21 June 2013 |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003013809/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22996054 |archive-date=3 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"urlQuantum Biology: Better Living Through Quantum Mechanics - The Nature of Reality\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ |title=Quantum Biology: Better living through quantum mechanics |series=The Nature of Reality |vauthors=Lloyd S |date=10 March 2014 |publisher=Nova: PBS Online; WGBH Boston |access-date=8 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703071034/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2014/03/quantum-life/ |archive-date=3 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid23788794\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hildner R, Brinks D, Nieder JB, Cogdell RJ, van Hulst NF |title=Quantum coherent energy transfer over varying pathways in single light-harvesting complexes |journal=Science |volume=340 |issue=6139 |pages=1448\u20131451 |date=June 2013 |pmid=23788794 |doi=10.1126/science.1235820 |bibcode=2013Sci...340.1448H}}</ref>\n\n==Evolution==\n{{Life timeline}}\n{{main|Evolution of photosynthesis}}\n\nEarly photosynthetic systems, such as those in [[Green sulfur bacteria|green]] and [[purple sulfur]] and [[Chloroflexi (phylum)|green]] and [[purple nonsulfur bacteria]], are thought to have been [[Anoxygenic photosynthesis|anoxygenic]], and used various other molecules than water as [[electron donor]]s.

After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate \u2013 much of the gained mass also comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.\n\n[[Joseph Priestley]], a chemist and minister, discovered that, when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar, and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO<sub>2</sub>), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly [[Breathing|\"injure\"]] air. He then showed that the air that had been \"injured\" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant.\n\nIn 1778, [[Jan Ingenhousz]], repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.\n\nIn 1796, [[Jean Senebier]], a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, [[Nicolas-Th\u00e9odore de Saussure]] showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO<sub>2</sub> but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.<ref>[[Eugene Rabinowitch]] (1945) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/26615#page/9/mode/1up Photosynthesis and Related Processes] via [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]</ref>\n\n[[Cornelis Van Niel]] made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen [[Reducing agent|reduces]] (donates its <sup>\u2013</sup> electron to) carbon dioxide.\n\n[[Robert Emerson (scientist)|Robert Emerson]] discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600&nbsp;nm wavelengths, the other up to 700&nbsp;nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll \"a\", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll \"a\" with most of the available chlorophyll \"b\", among other pigment. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta are equal in both the PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII system, which in turn powers the photochemistry.<ref name=\"ps\"/>\n\n[[Robin Hill (biochemist)|Robert Hill]] thought that a complex of reactions consisting of an intermediate to cytochrome b<sub>6</sub> (now a plastoquinone), another is from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f for it is a sufficient reductant. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water, were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated [[chloroplast]]s give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like [[iron]] [[oxalate]], [[ferricyanide]] or [[benzoquinone]] after exposure to light.

At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.\n\n<!--[[File:carbon a t.jpg|thumb|Carbon assimilation at a constant temperature.]] unsourced graph with swapped axis titles -->\nThese two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, [[photochemical]] reactions are not affected by [[temperature]]. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the [[Light-dependent reaction|light-dependent 'photochemical']] temperature-independent stage, and the [[Light-independent reaction|light-independent, temperature-dependent]] stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of [[limiting factor]]s. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, a series of proteins with different pigments surround the reaction center. This unit is called a [[phycobilisome]].{{clarify|date=November 2015}}\n\n===Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration===\n[[File:Photorespiration.svg|thumb|350px|Photorespiration]]\nAs carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the [[light-independent reaction]]s increases until limited by other factors. [[RuBisCO]], the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will [[Carbon fixation|fix carbon dioxide]]. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called [[photorespiration]], uses energy, but does not produce sugars.\n\nRuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:\n# One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of [[3-phosphoglycerate]] (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the [[Calvin-Benson cycle]].\n# Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.\n# Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>), which is able to [[Molecular diffusion|diffuse]] out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.\n\n::A highly simplified summary is:\n\n:::2 glycolate + ATP \u2192 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH<sub>3</sub>\n\nThe salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as [[photorespiration]], since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Environment|Ecology|Earth sciences|Metabolism}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jan Anderson (scientist)]]\n* [[Artificial photosynthesis]]\n* [[Calvin-Benson cycle]]\n* [[Carbon fixation]]\n* [[Cellular respiration]]\n* [[Chemosynthesis]]\n* [[Daily light integral]]\n* [[Hill reaction]]\n* [[Integrated fluorometer]]\n* [[Light-dependent reaction]]\n* [[Organic reaction]]\n* [[Photobiology]]\n* [[Photoinhibition]]\n* [[Photosynthetic reaction center]]\n* [[Photosynthetically active radiation]]\n* [[Photosystem]]\n* [[Photosystem I]]\n* [[Photosystem II]]\n* [[Quantum biology]]\n* [[Radiosynthesis (metabolism)|Radiosynthesis]]\n* [[Red edge]]\n* [[Vitamin D]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Library resources box\n|by=no\n|onlinebooks=no\n|others=no\n|about=yes\n|label=Photosynthesis}}\n\n===Books===\n{{Refbegin|33em}}\n* {{cite book |vauthors=Bidlack JE, Stern KR, Jansky S | title = Introductory Plant Biology | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-07-290941-8 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Blankenship RE | title = Molecular Mechanisms of Photosynthesis | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8975-0 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=jQztAgAAQBAJ}}}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Govindjee, Beatty JT, Gest H, Allen JF | title = Discoveries in Photosynthesis | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2006 | series = Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration | volume = 20 | isbn = 978-1-4020-3323-0 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=I3gy4r-aBusC}}}}\n* {{cite book  |vauthors=Reece JB, etal | title = Campbell Biology | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings]] | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-0-321-77565-8 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Papers===\n{{refbegin|33em}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta RS, Mukhtar T, Singh B | title = Evolutionary relationships among photosynthetic prokaryotes (''Heliobacterium chlorum'', ''Chloroflexus aurantiacus'', cyanobacteria, ''Chlorobium tepidum'' and proteobacteria): implications regarding the origin of photosynthesis | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 893\u2013906 | date = Jun 1999 | pmid = 10361294 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01417.x}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Rutherford AW, Faller P | title = Photosystem II: evolutionary perspectives | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.
