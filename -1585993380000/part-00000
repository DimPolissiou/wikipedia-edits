King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n{{multiple image\n| caption_align = center\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 380\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| image1 = Lithuanian Long currency in the Trakai Island Castle Museum.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Lithuanian long currency|Lithuanian long]] silver currency, 12th\u201315th centuries\n| image2 = 10 LT 1936 A Vytautas.png\n| caption2 = [[History of Lithuania#Independence (1918\u20131940)|Interwar]] 10 litas coin depicting [[Vytautas the Great]]\n}}\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania.

Lithuania chose a currency board system controlled by the Bank of Lithuania independent of any government institution.

King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n{{multiple image\n| caption_align = center\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 380\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| image1 = Lithuanian Long currency in the Trakai Island Castle Museum.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Lithuanian long currency|Lithuanian long]] silver currency, 12th\u201315th centuries\n| image2 = 10 LT 1936 A Vytautas.png\n| caption2 = [[History of Lithuania#Independence (1918\u20131940)|Interwar]] 10 litas coin depicting [[Vytautas the Great]]\n}}\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania.
