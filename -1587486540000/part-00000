Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically unexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where normative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of other identities (e.g., identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-form dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recurrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the norms of the culture or religion.|sign=|source=}}\n\n=== History in the DSM ===\nThe DSM-II used the term Hysterical Neurosis, Dissociative Type. It described the possible occurrence of alterations in the patient's state of consciousness or identity, and included the symptoms of \"amnesia, somnambulism, fugue, and multiple personality\".<ref name=dsmii/>  The DSM-III grouped the diagnosis with the other four major [[dissociative disorders]] using the term \"multiple personality disorder\".  The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] made more changes to DID than any other dissociative disorder,<ref name = Cardena/> and renamed it DID.<ref name=dsm/>  The name was changed for two reasons.  First, the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities, but rather a lack of a single, unified identity<ref name = Cardena/> and an emphasis on \"the identities as centers of information processing\".<ref name = Spiegel/>  Second, the term \"personality\" is used to refer to \"characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, moods and behaviors of the whole individual\", while for a patient with DID, the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality.<ref name = Cardena/>  It is for this reason the DSM-IV-TR referred to \"distinct identities or personality states\" instead of personalities.  The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters, they lack independent, objective existence.<ref name = Cardena/>  The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom, which was not included in the DSM-III-R because despite being a core symptom of the condition, patients may experience \"amnesia for the amnesia\" and fail to report it.<ref name = Spiegel/>  Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of [[Type II error|false negative]] diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID.<ref name = Cardena/>\n\nThe [[ICD-10]] places the diagnosis in the category of \"dissociative disorders\", within the subcategory of \"other dissociative (conversion) disorders\", but continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder.<ref name = ICD10/>\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for DID have been criticized for failing to capture the clinical complexity of DID, lacking usefulness in diagnosing individuals with DID (for instance, by focusing on the two least frequent and most subtle symptoms of DID) producing a high rate of [[Type II error|false negatives]] and an excessive number of DDNOS diagnoses, for excluding [[Spirit possession|possession]] (seen as a cross-cultural form of DID), and for including only two \"core\" symptoms of DID (amnesia and self-alteration) while failing to discuss hallucinations, trance-like states, [[somatoform disorder|somatoform]], [[depersonalization]], and [[derealization]] symptoms.  Arguments have been made for allowing diagnosis through the presence of some, but not all of the characteristics of DID rather than the current exclusive focus on the two least common and noticeable features.<ref name = Spiegel/>  The DSM-IV-TR criteria have also been criticized {{citation needed|date=August 2015}} for being [[tautology (logic)|tautological]], using imprecise and undefined language and for the use of instruments that give a false sense of validity and empirical certainty to the diagnosis.\n\nThe [[DSM-5]] updated the definition of DID in 2013, summarizing the changes as:<ref name=highlights>{{cite web | title = Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5 | url=http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917201810/http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Practice/DSM/DSM-5/Changes-from-DSM-IV-TR--to-DSM-5.pdf | archivedate=2013-09-17 | date = 2013-05-17 | publisher = [[American Psychiatric Association]] | accessdate = 2013-09-06}}</ref>\n{{quote|Several changes to the criteria for dissociative identity disorder have been made in DSM-5.

They assert that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed because of vague and unclear diagnostic criteria in the DSM and undefined concepts such as \"personality state\" and \"identities\", and question the evidence for childhood abuse beyond self-reports, the lack of definition of what would indicate a threshold of abuse sufficient to induce DID and the extremely small number of cases of children diagnosed with DID despite an average age of appearance of the first alter of three years.<ref name=\"pmid15560314\"/> Psychiatrist Colin Ross disagrees with Piper and Merskey's conclusion that DID cannot be accurately diagnosed, pointing to internal consistency between different structured dissociative disorder interviews (including the [[Dissociative Experiences Scale]], Dissociative Disorders Interview Schedule and Structured Clinical Interview for Dissociative Disorders)<ref name=Kihlstrom/> that are in the internal validity range of widely accepted mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and [[major depressive disorder]].

In addition, they recommended \"trauma-based cognitive therapy\" to reduce cognitive distortions related to trauma; they also recommended that the therapist deal with the dissociated identities early in treatment.

Within jurisprudence, there are three significant problems:<ref name=Rein2008/>\n# Individuals diagnosed with DID may accuse others of abuse, but lack objective evidence and base their accusations solely on regular or recovered memories.\n# There are questions regarding the civil and political rights of alters, particularly which alter can legally represent the person, sign a contract or [[vote]].\n# Finally, individuals diagnosed with DID who are accused of crimes may deny culpability on the grounds that the crime was committed by a different identity-state.\n\nIn cases where [[not guilty by reason of insanity]] (NGRI) is used as a defence in a court, it is normally accompanied by one of three legal approaches\u2014claiming a specific alter was in control when the crime was committed (and if that alter is considered insane), deciding whether all (or which) alters may be insane, or whether only the dominant personality meets the insanity standard.<ref name=Farrell/> NGRI is rarely successful for individuals with DID accused of committing crimes while in a dissociated state.<ref name=Farrell2011>{{cite journal |last=Farrell |first=HM |title=Dissociative identity disorder: No excuse for criminal activity |journal=Current Psychiatry |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=33\u201340 |url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69gTpoEKq?url=http://www.currentpsychiatry.org/pdf/1006/1006CP_Article3.pdf |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThere is no agreement within the legal and mental health fields whether an individual can be [[acquittal|acquitted]] due to a diagnosis of DID. It has been argued that any individual with DID is a single person with a serious mental illness, and therefore exhibits [[diminished responsibility]]; this was first recognized in an American court in 1978, in the ''[[Billy Milligan|State of Ohio v. Milligan]]'' case. However, public reaction to the result of the case involving William S. \"Billy\" Milligan was strongly negative, and since that time the few cases claiming insanity have found either that the altered consciousness found in DID is irrelevant or that the actual diagnosis itself was not [[admissible evidence]].<ref name=Farrell/> The self-reported nature of the symptoms used to reach a diagnosis makes it difficult to determine their credibility, although objective measuring of brain activation and structural patterns are a promising direction for future scientific research into distinguishing malingered from genuine DID in forensic settings.<ref name=Rein2008/> Forensic experts called on to conduct forensic examinations for DID must use a multidisciplinary approach, including multiple

Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically unexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where normative possession is common (e.g., rural areas in the developing world, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of other identities (e.g., identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possession-form dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recurrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the norms of the culture or religion.|sign=|source=}}\n\n=== History in the DSM ===\nThe DSM-II used the term Hysterical Neurosis, Dissociative Type.

The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] made more changes to DID than any other dissociative disorder,<ref name = Cardena/> and renamed it DID.<ref name=dsm/>  The name was changed for two reasons.  First, the change emphasizes the main problem is not a multitude of personalities, but rather a lack of a single, unified identity<ref name = Cardena/> and an emphasis on \"the identities as centers of information processing\".<ref name = Spiegel/>  Second, the term \"personality\" is used to refer to \"characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings, moods and behaviors of the whole individual\", while for a patient with DID, the switches between identities and behavior patterns is the personality.<ref name = Cardena/>  It is for this reason the DSM-IV-TR referred to \"distinct identities or personality states\" instead of personalities.  The diagnostic criteria also changed to indicate that while the patient may name and personalize alters, they lack independent, objective existence.<ref name = Cardena/>  The changes also included the addition of amnesia as a symptom, which was not included in the DSM-III-R because despite being a core symptom of the condition, patients may experience \"amnesia for the amnesia\" and fail to report it.<ref name = Spiegel/>  Amnesia was replaced when it became clear that the risk of [[Type II error|false negative]] diagnoses was low because amnesia was central to DID.<ref name = Cardena/>\n\nThe [[ICD-10]] places the diagnosis in the category of \"dissociative disorders\", within the subcategory of \"other dissociative (conversion) disorders\", but continues to list the condition as multiple personality disorder.<ref name = ICD10/>\n\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for DID have been criticized for failing to capture the clinical complexity of DID, lacking usefulness in diagnosing individuals with DID (for instance, by focusing on the two least frequent and most subtle symptoms of DID) producing a high rate of [[Type II error|false negatives]] and an excessive number of DDNOS diagnoses, for excluding [[Spirit possession|possession]] (seen as a cross-cultural form of DID), and for including only two \"core\" symptoms of DID (amnesia and self-alteration) while failing to discuss hallucinations, trance-like states, [[somatoform disorder|somatoform]], [[depersonalization]], and [[derealization]] symptoms.

Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomy]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], and [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]]. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemy and chemistry]], [[botany]] and [[agronomy]], [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography and cartography]], [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmology]], [[pharmacology]], [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|physics]], and [[zoology]].\n\nCORYXKENSHIN Medieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the ''[[Qibla]]'', the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Ibn al-'Awwam]], and geography enabled [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] made advances in [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[geometry]] and [[Arabic numerals]]. Islamic doctors described diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], and challenged classical Greek medical theory. [[Al-Biruni]], Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of [[drugs]] made from [[medicinal plants]] and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as [[Ibn Al-Haytham]], Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, criticised [[Aristotle]]'s view of motion.\n\nThe significance of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to [[medieval Europe]]. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|220px|[[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]]:\n{{legend|#a1584e|under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}}\n{{legend|#ef9070|under [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], 632\u2013661}}\n{{legend|#fad07d|under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliphs]], 661\u2013750}}]]\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|220px|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]], 750\u20131261 (and later in Egypt) at its height, c. 850]]\n{{further|History of Islam}}\n\nThe Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, eventually displacing the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s from the region. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the [[Islamic empire]] were translated into [[Arabic]] and occasionally [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Islamic culture inherited Greek]], [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indic]], [[Assyria]]n and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of [[high culture]] and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities. The [[Arab Agricultural Revolution]] in the countryside brought more crops and improved agricultural technology, especially [[irrigation]].

Alchemists regarded gold as the [[noble metal | noblest metal]], and held that other metals formed a series down to the basest, such as lead. They believed, too, that a fifth element, the [[elixir of life | elixir]], could transform a [[base metal]] into gold. [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] (8th\u20139th centuries) wrote on alchemy, based on his own experiments. He described laboratory techniques and experimental methods that would continue in use when alchemy had transformed into chemistry.

Islamic mathematics covered [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]]. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by [[al-Mansur]]'s group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary [[trigonometry| trigonometrical]] techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and [[Euclid's Elements |Euclid's ''Elements'']] were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries. Most medieval Islamic mathematicians wrote in Arabic, others in Persian.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Meri |first1=Josef W. |title=Medieval Islamic Civilization, Volume 1: An Encyclopedia |date=January 2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-96691-7 |pages=484\u2013485}}</ref><ref>Turner [[#CITEREFTurner1997|1997, pp.43\u201361]]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Jan P. |last=Hogendijk |last2=Berggren |first2=J.

[[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[sublimation (phase transition)| sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' provides instructions for preparing [[Simple (pharmacology)| \"simples\"]] from which were [[compounding| compounded]] the complex drugs then used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (died 869) was the first physician to describe a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Abu Mansur Muwaffaq | Al-Muwaffaq]], in the 10th century, wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', describing chemicals such as [[arsenious oxide]] and [[silicic acid]]. He distinguished between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also of [[lead]] compounds. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote the ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), describing in detail the properties of drugs, the role of pharmacy and the duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna |Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) described 700 preparations, their properties, their mode of action and their indications. He devoted a whole volume to simples in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini]] ({{circa}} 925\u20131015) and by [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074) were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by [[Masawaih al-Mardini | Mesue the Younger]] (died 1015) and as the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by [[Ibn al-Wafid | Abenguefit]] ({{circa}} 997 \u2013 1074) respectively. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Mardini under the title ''De Veneris''. [[Ibn al-Baytar]] (1197\u20131248), in his ''Al-Jami fi al-Tibb'', described a thousand simples and drugs based directly on Mediterranean plants collected along the entire coast between Syria and Spain, for the first time exceeding the coverage provided by [[Dioscorides]] in classical times.<ref>{{cite book |author= Levey, M. |date= 1973 |title= Early Arabic Pharmacology |publisher= E.

Islamic scientific achievements encompassed a wide range of subject areas, especially [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomy]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], and [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|medicine]]. Other subjects of scientific inquiry included [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemy and chemistry]], [[botany]] and [[agronomy]], [[Geography and cartography in medieval Islam|geography and cartography]], [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam|ophthalmology]], [[pharmacology]], [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|physics]], and [[zoology]].\n\nMedieval Islamic science had practical purposes as well as the goal of understanding. For example, astronomy was useful for determining the ''[[Qibla]]'', the direction in which to pray, botany had practical application in agriculture, as in the works of [[Ibn Bassal]] and [[Ibn al-'Awwam]], and geography enabled [[Abu Zayd al-Balkhi]] to make accurate maps. Islamic mathematicians such as [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Avicenna]] and [[Jamsh\u012bd al-K\u0101sh\u012b]] made advances in [[algebra]], [[trigonometry]], [[geometry]] and [[Arabic numerals]]. Islamic doctors described diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], and challenged classical Greek medical theory. [[Al-Biruni]], Avicenna and others described the preparation of hundreds of [[drugs]] made from [[medicinal plants]] and chemical compounds. Islamic physicists such as [[Ibn Al-Haytham]], Al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b and others studied optics and mechanics as well as astronomy, criticised [[Aristotle]]'s view of motion.\n\nThe significance of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to [[medieval Europe]]. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished across a wide area around the Mediterranean and further afield, for several centuries, in a wide range of institutions.\n\n==Context==\n[[File:Map of expansion of Caliphate.svg|thumb|220px|[[Early Muslim conquests|Islamic expansion]]:\n{{legend|#a1584e|under [[Muhammad]], 622\u2013632}}\n{{legend|#ef9070|under [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun caliphs]], 632\u2013661}}\n{{legend|#fad07d|under [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliphs]], 661\u2013750}}]]\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|220px|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]], 750\u20131261 (and later in Egypt) at its height, c. 850]]\n{{further|History of Islam}}\n\nThe Islamic era began in 622. Islamic armies conquered Arabia, Egypt and Mesopotamia, eventually displacing the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s from the region. Within a century, Islam had reached the area of present-day Portugal in the west and Central Asia in the east. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] (roughly between 786 and 1258) spanned the period of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] (750\u20131258), with stable political structures and flourishing trade. Major religious and cultural works of the [[Islamic empire]] were translated into [[Arabic]] and occasionally [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Transmission of the Greek Classics|Islamic culture inherited Greek]], [[Indian influence on Islamic science|Indic]], [[Assyria]]n and Persian influences. A new common civilisation formed, based on Islam. An era of [[high culture]] and innovation ensued, with rapid growth in population and cities.

Islamic mathematics covered [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and [[arithmetic]]. Algebra was mainly used for recreation: it had few practical applications at that time. Geometry was studied at different levels. Some texts contain practical geometrical rules for surveying and for measuring figures. Theoretical geometry was a necessary prerequisite for understanding astronomy and optics, and it required years of concentrated work. Early in the Abbasid caliphate (founded 750), soon after the foundation of Baghdad in 762, some mathematical knowledge was assimilated by [[al-Mansur]]'s group of scientists from the pre-Islamic Persian tradition in astronomy. Astronomers from India were invited to the court of the caliph in the late eighth century; they explained the rudimentary [[trigonometry| trigonometrical]] techniques used in Indian astronomy. Ancient Greek works such as [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'' and [[Euclid's Elements |Euclid's ''Elements'']] were translated into Arabic. By the second half of the ninth century, Islamic mathematicians were already making contributions to the most sophisticated parts of Greek geometry. Islamic mathematics reached its apogee in the Eastern part of the Islamic world between the tenth and twelfth centuries.

[[Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi]] (Rhazes) (865\u2013915) promoted the medical uses of chemical compounds. [[Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi]] (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by [[sublimation (phase transition)| sublimation]] and [[distillation]]. His ''Liber servitoris'' provides instructions for preparing [[Simple (pharmacology)| \"simples\"]] from which were [[compounding| compounded]] the complex drugs then used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (died 869) was the first physician to describe a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. [[Abu Mansur Muwaffaq | Al-Muwaffaq]], in the 10th century, wrote ''The foundations of the true properties of Remedies'', describing chemicals such as [[arsenious oxide]] and [[silicic acid]]. He distinguished between [[sodium carbonate]] and [[potassium carbonate]], and drew attention to the poisonous nature of [[copper]] compounds, especially copper [[vitriol]], and also of [[lead]] compounds. [[Al-Biruni]] (973\u20131050) wrote the ''Kitab al-Saydalah'' (''The Book of Drugs''), describing in detail the properties of drugs, the role of pharmacy and the duties of the pharmacist. [[Avicenna |Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna) described 700 preparations, their properties, their mode of action and their indications. He devoted a whole volume to simples in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]''. Works by [[Masawaih al-Mardini]] ({{circa}} 925\u20131015) and by [[Ibn al-Wafid]] (1008\u20131074) were printed in [[Latin]] more than fifty times, appearing as ''De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus'' by [[Masawaih al-Mardini | Mesue the Younger]] (died 1015) and as the ''Medicamentis simplicibus'' by [[Ibn al-Wafid | Abenguefit]] ({{circa}} 997 \u2013 1074) respectively. [[Peter of Abano]] (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Mardini under the title ''De Veneris''. [[Ibn al-Baytar]] (1197\u20131248), in his ''Al-Jami fi al-Tibb'', described a thousand simples and drugs based directly on Mediterranean plants collected along the entire coast between Syria and Spain, for the first time exceeding the coverage provided by [[Dioscorides]] in classical times.<ref>{{cite book |author= Levey, M. |date= 1973 |title= Early Arabic Pharmacology |publisher= E.

Mario and friends must now travel across this new land returning to Peach's castle in order to save her. On the way, they encounter seven Koopalings each controlling their own worlds, plus [[Kamek]], Nabbit, Bowser Jr., and many minor monsters like [[Goomba]]. By conquering them, they get closer to Peach's castle, which has been transformed into an evil reflection of Bowser. By defeating Bowser, the castle returns to normal. As the heroes celebrate, Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings attempt to escape, almost leaving Bowser behind. He manages to jump up onto the airship, but his weight causes it to crash, and they are forced to flee on Bowser Jr.'s Koopa Clown Car.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Wii U with stylus at Igromir 2013 (10096264706).jpg|thumb|left|Players can use the Wii U GamePad's stylus to add platforms and stun enemies on the main screen.]]\n\n''New Super Mario Bros. U'' iterates on the gameplay featured in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. Wii]]''. The objective of each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] is to reach the goal flag at the end of each level while avoiding enemies and hazards.\n\nThe game can be controlled either using [[Wii Remote]]s or the [[Wii U GamePad]], the latter of which allows for [[Off-TV Play]], where the game can be played solely on the GamePad's screen, without the use of a television.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-9020_7-57552003-222/what-the-wii-u-needs-next/ |title=What the Wii U needs next |first=Scott |last=Stein |date=November 19, 2012 |work=[[CNET]] |accessdate=December 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127194909/http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-9020_7-57552003-222/what-the-wii-u-needs-next/ |archive-date=2012-11-27 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> [[Wii U Pro Controller]] support was added in the 1.3.0 patch.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://mynintendonews.com/2013/06/20/new-super-mario-bros-u-update-allows-wii-u-pro-controller-use/|title=New Super Mario Bros.

In multiplayer, the player using the Wii U GamePad cannot control a character, but instead can interact with the environment, such as putting blocks down that can aid Mario or stunning enemies. As such, in multiplayer, there must be an equal number of controllers, excluding the GamePad, to the desired number of on-screen characters.\n\nCertain game modes also allow players to play [[Mii]] characters saved on their console. New to this release is an asymmetric multiplayer experience called Boost Mode. In this mode, the player with the GamePad can aid other players by using the touchscreen to place blocks on the screen or stun enemies. This can be used to assist amateur players and to allow expert players to perform speed runs.<ref name=\"flying squirrel\"/>\n<ref name=\"gamerant\"/> The [[Koopalings]], [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], [[Kamek]], Boom Boom, and [[Bowser Jr.]] appear as the game's main villains.\n\nAlong with returning elements, such as Ice Flowers and [[Yoshi]]s, ''New Super Mario Bros.

New to this release is an asymmetric multiplayer experience called Boost Mode.

U'' was positively received by critics. ''GamesMaster'' magazine called it \"a great excuse for families to gather round the TV, and an enticing glimpse of Mario's HD future\".<ref name=\"gamesmasterreview\"/>\n[[IGN]] stated that \"Nintendo's approach here strikes a great balance in all areas, ranging from its difficulty to design to enemies and bosses\".<ref name=\"ignreview\"/> ''[[Joystiq]]'' commented \"There's a sense of wonder again, of exploration and discovery. I'm not quite prepared to say ''New Super Mario Bros. U'' fully recaptures the spark of Mario's 2D heyday, but it's an impressive step in the right direction\".<ref name=\"joystiqreview\"/> ''[[Game Informer]]'' considers it the best game in the ''New Super Mario Bros.'' series, saying it has \"Some of the most creative ''NSMB'' levels Nintendo has created\".<ref name=\"gameinformerreview\"/> [[GameSpot]] observes \"It's a challenging platformer, an excellent recreation of Mario's best moments, and it's the perfect way to kick-off Nintendo's journey into HD.\"<ref name=\"GS\"/> SupeReal Media gave the game an 'A' Grade, praising the versatility, and stating that Mario has never looked so good.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hradsky |first=Brian |url=http://superealmedia.com/2014/01/01/game-reviews-new-super-mario-bros-wii-u/ |title=Game Reviews \"New Super Mario Bros.

U'' is pretty exciting, except the game itself. Is it possible that this is the best game in the 'New' series to date--not to mention one of the best exclusive Wii U games on the market, by default\u2014and at the same time kind of flatly uninteresting? Apparently so. The game is perfectly well made for what it is, and I had plenty of fun playing it in short bursts here and there, but at this point the series' by-the-numbers design philosophy is starting to lend the name 'New Super Mario Bros.' a degree of unintentional irony\".<ref name=\"giantbombreview\"/>\nAt the 10th Annual [[VGX (award show)|Spike Video Game Awards]] on [[Spike (TV network)|Spike]], ''New Super Mario Bros.
