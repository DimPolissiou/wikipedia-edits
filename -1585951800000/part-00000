He received an Oscar nomination for the [[4th Academy Awards]] in 1930 for ''[[The Royal Family of Broadway]]'', in which he played a role modeled on [[John Barrymore]].

He returned to Broadway after a ten-year absence in 1937 with a notable flop, ''Yr. Obedient Husband'', but after the success of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', he focused as much on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] as on [[Hollywood]]. He won two Best Actor [[Tony Awards]]: in 1947 for the play ''Years Ago'', written by [[Ruth Gordon]]; and in 1957 for his performance as James Tyrone in the original Broadway production of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Long Day's Journey Into Night]]''. He also had major successes in ''[[A Bell for Adano]]'' in 1944 and ''[[Gideon (play)|Gideon]]'' in 1961, and played [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] ''[[An Enemy of the People]]'' on Broadway in 1951. During this period, he also starred in films, including ''[[I Married a Witch]]'' (1942) and ''[[Another Part of the Forest (film)|Another Part of the Forest]]'' (1948), and won his second [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in 1946 for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''.\n\nMarch also branched out into television, winning Emmy nominations for his third attempt at ''[[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]]'' for the series ''[[The Best of Broadway]]'' as well as for television performances as [[Dodsworth (novel)|Samuel Dodsworth]] and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. On March 25, 1954, March co-hosted the [[26th Academy Awards|26th Annual Academy Awards]] ceremony from [[New York City]], with co-host [[Donald O'Connor]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n[[File:Inherit the wind trailer (6) Spencer Tracy Fredric March.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Drummond ([[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]], left) and Matthew Harrison Brady (March, right) in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''. Previously, March had taken the role in ''The Desperate Hours'' originally offered to Tracy. Both men had also played Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.]]\n\nMarch's neighbor in Connecticut, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], was thought to favor March to inaugurate the part of [[Willy Loman]] in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949). However, March read the play and turned down the role, whereupon director [[Elia Kazan]] cast [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Willy, and [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]] as one of Willy's sons, [[Biff Loman]], two men that the director had worked with in the film ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'' (1947). March later regretted turning down the role, and finally played Willy Loman in [[Columbia Pictures]]'s [[Death of a Salesman (1951 film)|1951 film version of the play]], directed by [[Laslo Benedek]], receiving his fifth, and final, [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]]. March also played one of two leads in ''[[The Desperate Hours (1955 film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' (1955) with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart and [[Spencer Tracy]] had both insisted upon top billing, and Tracy withdrew, leaving the part available for March.\n\nIn 1957, March was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by [[George Eastman House]] for \"distinguished contribution to the art of film\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Awards granted by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film |url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php |publisher=[[George Eastman House]] |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415183637/http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php |archivedate=April 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn February 12, 1959, March appeared before a [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress#1950s|joint session]] of the [[86th United States Congress]], reading the [[Gettysburg Address]] as part of a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nation Honor Lincoln On Sesquicentennial |url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1959summer/ishs-1959summer-291.pdf |date=February 11, 1959 |work=[[The Journal News|Yonkers Herald-Statesman]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |quote=Congress gets into the act tomorrow, when a joint session will be held.

March's Bible-thumping character provided a rival for Tracy's [[Clarence Darrow]]-inspired character. In the 1960s, March's film career continued with a performance as President Jordan Lyman in the political thriller ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), in which he co-starred with [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Kirk Douglas]], and [[Edmond O'Brien]]; the part earned March a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor.\n\nMarch made several spoken word recordings, including a version of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales|The Selfish Giant]]'' issued in 1945, in which he narrated and played the title role, and ''[[The Sounds of History]]'', a twelve volume LP set accompanying the twelve volume set of books ''The [[Life Magazine|Life]] History of the United States'', published by [[Time-Life]]. The recordings were narrated by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], with March and his wife Florence Eldridge performing dramatic readings from historical documents and literature.\n\nFollowing surgery for [[prostate cancer]] in 1970, it seemed his career was over; yet, he managed to give one last performance in ''[[The Iceman Cometh (1973 film)|The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1973), as the complicated Irish saloon keeper, Harry Hope.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Fredric March in Best Years of Our Lives trailer.jpg|thumb|March in 1946]]\n \nMarch was married to actress [[Florence Eldridge]] from 1927 until his death in 1975, and they had two adopted children.

During this period, he also starred in films, including ''[[I Married a Witch]]'' (1942) and ''[[Another Part of the Forest (film)|Another Part of the Forest]]'' (1948), and won his second [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Oscar]] in 1946 for ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]''.\n\nMarch also branched out into television, winning Emmy nominations for his third attempt at ''[[The Royal Family (play)|The Royal Family]]'' for the series ''[[The Best of Broadway]]'' as well as for television performances as [[Dodsworth (novel)|Samuel Dodsworth]] and [[Ebenezer Scrooge]]. On March 25, 1954, March co-hosted the [[26th Academy Awards|26th Annual Academy Awards]] ceremony from [[New York City]], with co-host [[Donald O'Connor]] in [[Los Angeles]].\n[[File:Inherit the wind trailer (6) Spencer Tracy Fredric March.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Drummond ([[Spencer Tracy|Tracy]], left) and Matthew Harrison Brady (March, right) in ''[[Inherit the Wind (1960 film)|Inherit the Wind]]''. Previously, March had taken the role in ''The Desperate Hours'' originally offered to Tracy. Both men had also played Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.]]\n\nMarch's neighbor in Connecticut, playwright [[Arthur Miller]], was thought to favor March to inaugurate the part of [[Willy Loman]] in the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' (1949). However, March read the play and turned down the role, whereupon director [[Elia Kazan]] cast [[Lee J. Cobb]] as Willy, and [[Arthur Kennedy (actor)|Arthur Kennedy]] as one of Willy's sons, [[Biff Loman]], two men that the director had worked with in the film ''[[Boomerang (1947 film)|Boomerang]]'' (1947). March later regretted turning down the role, and finally played Willy Loman in [[Columbia Pictures]]'s [[Death of a Salesman (1951 film)|1951 film version of the play]], directed by [[Laslo Benedek]], receiving his fifth, and final, [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination as well as a [[Golden Globe Award]]. March also played one of two leads in ''[[The Desperate Hours (1955 film)|The Desperate Hours]]'' (1955) with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart and [[Spencer Tracy]] had both insisted upon top billing, and Tracy withdrew, leaving the part available for March.\n\nIn 1957, March was awarded the George Eastman Award, given by [[George Eastman House]] for \"distinguished contribution to the art of film\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Awards granted by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography & Film |url=http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php |publisher=[[George Eastman House]] |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415183637/http://www.eastmanhouse.org/museum/awards.php |archivedate=April 15, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn February 12, 1959, March appeared before a [[List of joint sessions of the United States Congress#1950s|joint session]] of the [[86th United States Congress]], reading the [[Gettysburg Address]] as part of a commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nation Honor Lincoln On Sesquicentennial |url=http://dig.lib.niu.edu/ISHS/ishs-1959summer/ishs-1959summer-291.pdf |date=February 11, 1959 |work=[[The Journal News|Yonkers Herald-Statesman]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=April 25, 2013 |quote=Congress gets into the act tomorrow, when a joint session will be held.

March's Bible-thumping character provided a rival for Tracy's [[Clarence Darrow]]-inspired character. In the 1960s, March's film career continued with a performance as President Jordan Lyman in the political thriller ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), in which he co-starred with [[Burt Lancaster]], [[Kirk Douglas]], and [[Edmond O'Brien]]; the part earned March a Golden Globe nomination as Best Actor.\n\nMarch made several spoken word recordings, including a version of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Happy Prince and Other Tales|The Selfish Giant]]'' issued in 1945, in which he narrated and played the title role, and ''[[The Sounds of History]]'', a twelve volume LP set accompanying the twelve volume set of books ''The [[Life Magazine|Life]] History of the United States'', published by [[Time-Life]]. The recordings were narrated by [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], with March and his wife Florence Eldridge performing dramatic readings from historical documents and literature.\n\nFollowing surgery for [[prostate cancer]] in 1970, it seemed his career was over; yet, he managed to give one last performance in ''[[The Iceman Cometh (1973 film)|The Iceman Cometh]]'' (1973), as the complicated Irish saloon keeper, Harry Hope.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Fredric March in Best Years of Our Lives trailer.jpg|thumb|March in 1946]]\n \nMarch was married to actress [[Florence Eldridge]] from 1927 until his death in 1975, and they had two adopted children.

Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such [[joint replacement]] [[orthopaedic surgery]] is generally conducted to relieve [[arthritis]] [[pain]] or in some [[hip fracture]]s. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty or THA) consists of replacing both the [[acetabulum]] and the femoral head while [[hemiarthroplasty]] generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely.  Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JT, Evans JP, Walker RW, Blom AW, Whitehouse MR, Sayers A | title = How long does a hip replacement last?

Other indications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[avascular necrosis]], [[traumatic arthritis]], [[protrusio acetabuli]], certain [[hip fracture]]s, benign and malignant [[bone tumor]]s, arthritis associated with [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as [[physical therapy]] and pain medications, have recently failed.\n\n==Risks==\nRisks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all [[Joint replacement#Risks and complications|joint replacements]]. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death.

Specificity improves when the tests are performed in patients in whom clinical suspicion exists. ESR and CRP remain good 1st line tests for screening (high sensitivity, low specificity).  Aspiration of the joint remains the test with the highest specificity for confirming infection.\n\n===Dislocation===\n[[File:Dislocated hip replacement.jpg|thumb|upright|Dislocated artificial hip]]\n[[File:Hip prosthesis liner creep and wear.png|thumb|160px|Liner wear, particularly when over 2 mm, increases the risk of dislocation.<ref name=berry2012/> Liner creep, on the other hand, is normal remoulding.<ref name=Watt/>]]\n\nDislocation is the most common complication of hip replacement surgery.

During this period, the hip ball can come out of the socket. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the tissue cut is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used.\n\nDislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles.<ref name=berry2012/>\n\nRisk factors of late dislocation (after five years) mainly include:<ref name=berry2012/>\n\n* Female gender\n* Younger age at primary hip arthroplasty\n* Previous [[subluxation]] without complete dislocation\n* Previous trauma\n* Substantial weight loss\n* Recent onset or progression of [[dementia]] or a [[neurological disorder]]\n* Malposition of the cup\n* Wear of the liner, particularly when it causes movement of the head of more than 2&nbsp;mm within the cup compared to its original position\n* Prosthesis loosening with migration\n\nSurgeons who perform more of the operations each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate. Doing the surgery from an anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but the benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions with the use of larger diameter heads. The use of larger diameter head size does in itself decrease the risk of dislocation, even though this correlation is only found in head sizes up to 28&nbsp;mm, thereafter no additional decrease in dislocation rate is found.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hailer NP, Weiss RJ, Stark A, K\u00e4rrholm J | title = The risk of revision due to dislocation after total hip arthroplasty depends on surgical approach, femoral head size, sex, and primary diagnosis.

An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by 6 months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery (<1&nbsp;cm) to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than 6 months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction.\n\n===Fracture===\n[[File:Intraoperative acetabular fracture, annotated.jpg|thumb|150px|Intraoperative acetabular fracture.]]\nIntraoperative fractures may occur.

This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.\n\n===Loosening===\n[[File:Hip joint aseptic loosening ar1938-1.png|thumb|upright|Hip prosthesis displaying aseptic loosening (arrows)]]\n[[File:Hip prosthesis zones by DeLee and Charnley system, and Gruen system.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Hip prosthesis zones]] according to DeLee and Charnley,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Adult Hip, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fwULYB1gJIC&pg=PA958|author=John J.

Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip ([[iliopsoas]]) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Incision made in the front of the hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).\n\n===Death===\nThe rate of [[perioperative mortality]] for elective hip replacements is significantly less than 1%.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cot\u00e9, John|title=Hip replacement is not viewed as high-risk surgery; Death is rare, but underlying medical condition a factor|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 22, 2007|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-07-22/news/17254067_1_hip-replacement-hip-replacement-surgery-blood-clot}}</ref><ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/588980 Medscape Conference Coverage], American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2009 Annual Meeting, AAOS 2009: Certain Factors Increase Risk for Death After Total Hip Arthroplasty, Barbara Boughton, March 3, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Metal-on-metal hip implant failure===\n{{See also|Implant failure}}\nBy 2010, reports in the orthopaedic literature increasingly cited the problem of early failure of metal on metal prostheses in a small percentage of patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mikhael MM, Hanssen AD, Sierra RJ | title = Failure of metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty mimicking hip infection.

His work in the field of [[tribology]] resulted in a design that almost completely replaced the other designs by the 1970s.  Charnley's design consisted of three parts:\n\n# [[Stainless Steel|stainless steel]] one-piece femoral stem and head\n# [[polyethylene]] (originally [[Teflon]]), acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using\n# [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] (acrylic) [[bone cement]]\n\nThe replacement joint, which was known as the Low Friction [[Arthroplasty]], was lubricated with [[synovial fluid]]. The small femoral head ({{convert|7/8|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.\n\nThe Exeter hip stem was developed in the United Kingdom during the same time as the Charnley device. Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon [[Robin Ling]] and [[University of Exeter]] engineer [[Clive Lee]] and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary|title=Robin Ling obituary|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2017|first=A John|last=Timperley| name-list-format = vanc |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions.\n\nEarly implant designs had the potential to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.\n\nInitial hip designs were made of a one-piece femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.\n\nTo combat loosening caused by polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel materials for the acetabular liners. [[Ceramic]] heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE was introduced in the late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.\n\nWhen currently available implants are used, cemented stems tend to have a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several incisions, defined by their relation to the gluteus medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool),<ref name=\"pmid9498150\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pai VS | title = A comparison of three lateral approaches in primary total hip replacement | journal = International Orthopaedics | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 393\u20138 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9498150 | pmc = 3619565 | doi = 10.1007/s002640050193 | url = http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020108155635/http://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm | archive-date = 2002-01-08 }}</ref> antero-lateral (Watson-Jones),<ref name=\"titleAnterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterolateral_approach_to_hip_joint_watson_jones |title=Anterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) \u2013 Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |access-date=2007-11-26 |website=}}</ref> anterior (Smith-Petersen)<ref name=\"titleAnterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterior_approach_to_the_hip_smith_peterson |title=Anterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) \u2013 Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |access-date=2007-11-26 |website=}}</ref> and [[greater trochanter]] osteotomy. There is no compelling evidence in the literature for any particular approach.\n\n===Posterior approach===\nThe ''posterior'' (''Moore'' or ''Southern'') ''approach'' accesses the joint and capsule through the back, taking [[piriformis muscle]] and the short external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductors]] and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It has the advantage of becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk. Limited evidence suggests that the posterior approach may cause less nerve damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jolles BM, Bogoch ER | title = Posterior versus lateral surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty in adults with osteoarthritis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD003828 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16856020 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd003828.pub3 }}</ref>\n\n===Lateral approach===\nThe ''lateral approach'' is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires elevation of the hip abductors ([[gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus]]) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley),{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using [[surgical suture|sutures]]. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.\n\n=== Antero-lateral approach ===\nThe ''anterolateral approach'' develops the interval between the [[tensor fasciae latae]] and the gluteus medius. The Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after the replacement of the joint.\n\n=== Anterior approach ===\nThe ''anterior approach'' uses an interval between the [[sartorius muscle]] and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement. When used with older hip implant systems that had a small diameter head, dislocation rates were reduced compared to surgery performed through a posterior approach. With modern implant designs, dislocation rates are similar between the anterior and posterior approaches.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Maratt JD, Gagnier JJ, Butler PD, Hallstrom BR, Urquhart AG, Roberts KC | title = No Difference in Dislocation Seen in Anterior Vs Posterior Approach Total Hip Arthroplasty | journal = The Journal of Arthroplasty | volume = 31 | issue = 9 Suppl | pages = 127\u201330 | date = September 2016 | pmid = 27067754 | doi = 10.1016/j.arth.2016.02.071 }}</ref> The anterior approach has been shown in studies to variably improve early functional recovery, with possible complications of femoral component loosening and early revision compared to other approaches<ref name=\"Direct Anterior Approach\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meneghini RM, Elston AS, Chen AF, Kheir MM, Fehring TK, Springer BD | title = Direct Anterior Approach: Risk Factor for Early Femoral Failure of Cementless Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Multicenter Study | journal = The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

However, component positioning accuracy and visualization of the bone structures can be significantly impaired as the approaches get smaller.

The majority of current orthopedic surgeons use a \"minimally invasive\" approach compared to traditional approaches which were quite large comparatively.\n\n[[Computer-assisted surgery]] and robotic surgery techniques are also available to guide the surgeon to provide enhanced accuracy.

Options exist for different people and indications. The evidence for a number of newer devices is not very good, including: ceramic-on-ceramic bearings, modular femoral necks, and uncemented monoblock cups.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nieuwenhuijse MJ, Nelissen RG, Schoones JW, Sedrakyan A | title = Appraisal of evidence base for introduction of new implants in hip and knee replacement: a systematic review of five widely used device technologies | journal = BMJ | volume = 349 | issue = sep09 1 | pages = g5133 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25208953 | pmc = 4159610 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.g5133 }}</ref> Correct selection of the prosthesis is important.\n\n===Acetabular cup===\nThe acetabular cup is the component which is placed into the [[acetabulum]] (hip socket). Cartilage and bone are removed from the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is held in place by a metal coating on the outside of the cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are [[sintering|sintered]] beads and a [[foam metal]] design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force.<ref name=\"Amirouche\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Amirouche F, Solitro G, Broviak S, Gonzalez M, Goldstein W, Barmada R | title = Factors influencing initial cup stability in total hip arthroplasty | journal = Clinical Biomechanics | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201385 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25266242 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.09.006 }}</ref> Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a [[Morse taper]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Femoral component===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The femoral component is the component that fits in the [[femur]] (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped to accept the femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There are two types of fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic [[bone cement]] to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a [[Morse taper]]. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.\n\n===Articular interface===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The articular interface is not part of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]] at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are {{convert|28|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|32|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|36|mm|abbr=on}}. While {{convert|22.25|mm|frac=8|abbr=on}} was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54&nbsp;mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled to reduce the amount of wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nDual mobility hip replacements reduce the risk of dislocation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blakeney WG, Epinette JA, Vendittoli PA | title = Dual mobility total hip arthroplasty: should everyone get one? | journal = EFORT Open Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 541\u2013547 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31598332 | pmc = 6771074 | doi = 10.1302/2058-5241.4.180045 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horriat S, Haddad FS | title = Dual mobility in hip arthroplasty: What evidence do we need? | journal = Bone & Joint Research | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 508\u2013510 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30258569 | pmc = 6138808 | doi = 10.1302/2046-3758.78.BJR-2018-0217 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blakeney WG, Epinette JA, Vendittoli PA | title = Dual mobility total hip arthroplasty: should everyone get one? | journal = EFORT Open Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 541\u2013547 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31598332 | pmc = 6771074 | doi = 10.1302/2058-5241.4.180045 }}</ref>\n\n==Configuration==\nPost-operative [[projectional radiography]] is routinely performed to ensure proper configuration of hip prostheses.\n\nThe direction of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt/> For this purpose, the ''acetabular inclination'' and the ''acetabular anteversion'' are measurements of cup angulation in the [[coronal plane]] and the [[sagittal plane]], respectively.\n<gallery widths=\"230\">\nFile:Acetabular inclination of hip prosthesis.jpg|Acetabular inclination.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> This parameter is calculated on an anteroposterior radiograph as the angle between a line through the lateral and medial margins of the acetabular cup and the ''transischial line'' which is tangential to the inferior margins of the [[ischium]] bones.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanrusselt J, Vansevenant M, Vanderschueren G, Vanhoenacker F | title = Postoperative radiograph of the hip arthroplasty: what the radiologist should know | journal = Insights into Imaging | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 591\u2013600 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26487647 | pmc = 4656234 | doi = 10.1007/s13244-015-0438-5 }}</ref>\nFile:Range of acetabular inclination.png|Acetabular inclination is normally between 30 and 50\u00b0.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> A larger angle increases the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p431c8258e7ac3/hip-arthroplasty.html|title=Hip - Arthroplasty - Normal and abnormal imaging findings| first1 = Iain | last1 = Watt | first2 = Susanne | last2 = Boldrik | first3 = Evert | last3 = van Langelaan | first4 = Robin | last4 = Smithuis | name-list-format = vanc |website=Radiology Assistant |access-date=2017-05-21 }}</ref>\nFile:Acetabular anteversion of hip prosthesis.jpg|Acetabular anteversion.<ref name=\"ShinLee2015\"/> This parameter is calculated on a lateral radiograph as the angle between the [[transverse plane]] and a line going through the (anterior and posterior) margins of the acetabular cup.<ref name=\"ShinLee2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin WC, Lee SM, Lee KW, Cho HJ, Lee JS, Suh KT | title = The reliability and accuracy of measuring anteversion of the acetabular component on plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs after total hip arthroplasty | journal = The Bone & Joint Journal | volume = 97-B | issue = 5 | pages = 611\u20136 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25922453 | doi = 10.1302/0301-620X.97B5.34735 }}</ref>\nFile:Range of acetabular anteversion.png|Acetabular anteversion is normally between 5 and 25\u00b0.<ref name=Watt/> An anteversion below or above this range increases the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt/> There is an [[intra-individual variability]] in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the transverse plane.<ref name=Watt/>\nFile:Leg length discrepancy after hip replacement.jpg|''Leg length discrepancy'' after hip replacement is calculated as the vertical distance between the middle of the minor trochanters, using the acetabular tear drops<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> or the transischial line<ref name=Watt/> as references for the horizontal plane.

The original prosthesis he designed was a proximal femoral replacement, with a large fixed head made of the cobalt-chrome alloy [[Vitallium]].

A later version, the so-called Austin Moore Prosthesis which was introduced in 1952, is still in use today, although rarely.  Like modern hip implants, it is inserted into the medullary canal of the femur, and depends on bone growth through a hole in the stem for long-term attachment.\n\n==Other animals==\n{{Main|Hip replacement (animal)}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[2010 DePuy Hip Recall]]\n* [[Abductor wedge]]\n* [[Femoral Acetabular Impingement]]\n* [[Gruen zone]]\n* [[Hip examination]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060619082711/http://www.edheads.org/activities/hip/ Edheads Virtual Hip Surgery + Surgery Photos]\n* [http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/fact/thr_report.cfm?Thread_ID=271&topcategory=Hip AAOS Hip Replacement]\n\n{{Operations and other procedures on the musculoskeletal system}}\n\n<!-- Place all category tags here -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hip Replacement}}\n[[Category:Implants (medicine)]]\n[[Category:Orthopedic surgical procedures]]\n[[Category:Pelvis]]\n[[Category:Prosthetics]]\n[[Category:Orthopedic implants]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Surgery replacing hip joint with prosthetic implant}}\n{{Infobox medical intervention \n|  Name        = Hip replacement \n| synonyms     = Hip athroplasty\n|  Image       = X-ray of pelvis with total arthroplasty.jpg\n|  Caption     = An [[X-ray]] showing a left hip (right of image) that has been replaced, with the ball of this ball-and-socket joint replaced by a metal head that is set in the [[femur]] and the socket replaced by a cup. \n|  ICD10       = \n|  ICD9        = {{ICD9proc|81.51}}\u2013{{ICD9proc|81.53}} \n|  MeshID      = D019644 \n|  OPS301      = \n|  OtherCodes  = \n|  MedlinePlus = 002975\n}}\n'''Hip replacement''' is a [[surgery|surgical]] procedure in which the [[hip]] joint is replaced by a prosthetic [[implant (medicine)|implant]], that is, a '''hip prosthesis'''. Hip replacement surgery can be performed as a total replacement or a hemi (half) replacement. Such [[joint replacement]] [[orthopaedic surgery]] is generally conducted to relieve [[arthritis]] [[pain]] or in some [[hip fracture]]s. A total hip replacement (total hip arthroplasty or THA) consists of replacing both the [[acetabulum]] and the femoral head while [[hemiarthroplasty]] generally only replaces the femoral head. Hip replacement is currently one of the most common orthopaedic operations, though patient satisfaction short- and long-term varies widely.  Approximately 58% of total hip replacements are estimated to last 25 years.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans JT, Evans JP, Walker RW, Blom AW, Whitehouse MR, Sayers A | title = How long does a hip replacement last?

Other indications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[avascular necrosis]], [[traumatic arthritis]], [[protrusio acetabuli]], certain [[hip fracture]]s, benign and malignant [[bone tumor]]s, arthritis associated with [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]] and [[juvenile rheumatoid arthritis]]. The aims of the procedure are pain relief and improvement in hip function. Hip replacement is usually considered only after other therapies, such as [[physical therapy]] and pain medications, have recently failed.\n\n==Risks==\nRisks and complications in hip replacement are similar to those associated with all [[Joint replacement#Risks and complications|joint replacements]]. They can include infection, dislocation, limb length inequality, loosening, impingement, osteolysis, metal sensitivity, nerve palsy, chronic pain and death.

During this period, the hip ball can come out of the socket. The chance of this is diminished if less tissue is cut, if the tissue cut is repaired and if large diameter head balls are used.\n\nDislocations occurring between three months and five years after insertion usually occur due to malposition of the components, or dysfunction of nearby muscles.<ref name=berry2012/>\n\nRisk factors of late dislocation (after five years) mainly include:<ref name=berry2012/>\n\n* Female gender\n* Younger age at primary hip arthroplasty\n* Previous [[subluxation]] without complete dislocation\n* Previous trauma\n* Substantial weight loss\n* Recent onset or progression of [[dementia]] or a [[neurological disorder]]\n* Malposition of the cup\n* Wear of the liner, particularly when it causes movement of the head of more than 2&nbsp;mm within the cup compared to its original position\n* Prosthesis loosening with migration\n\nSurgeons who perform more of the operations each year tend to have fewer patients dislocate. Doing the surgery from an anterior approach seems to lower dislocation rates when small diameter heads are used, but the benefit has not been shown when compared to modern posterior incisions with the use of larger diameter heads.

An arthritic hip can develop contractures that make the leg behave as if it is short. When these are relieved with replacement surgery and normal motion and function are restored, the body feels that the limb is now longer than it was. This feeling usually subsides by 6 months after surgery as the body adjusts to the new hip joint. The cause of this feeling is variable, and usually related to abductor muscle weakness, pelvic obliquity, and minor lengthening of the hip during surgery (<1&nbsp;cm) to achieve stability and restore the joint to pre-arthritic mechanics. If the limb length difference remains bothersome to the patient more than 6 months after surgery, a shoe lift can be used. Only in extreme cases is surgery required for correction.\n\n===Fracture===\n[[File:Intraoperative acetabular fracture, annotated.jpg|thumb|150px|Intraoperative acetabular fracture.]]\nIntraoperative fractures may occur.

This is the loss of bone caused by the body's reaction to polyethylene wear debris, fine bits of plastic that come off the cup liner over time. An [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process causes bone resorption that may lead to subsequent loosening of the hip implants and even fractures in the bone around the implants. In an attempt to eliminate the generation of wear particles, ceramic bearing surfaces are being used in the hope that they will have less wear and less osteolysis with better long-term results. Metal cup liners joined with metal heads (metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty) were also developed for similar reasons. In the lab these show excellent wear characteristics and benefit from a different mode of lubrication. At the same time that these two bearing surfaces were being developed, highly cross linked polyethylene plastic liners were also developed. The greater cross linking significantly reduces the amount of plastic wear debris given off over time. The newer ceramic and metal prostheses do not always have the long-term track record of established metal on poly bearings. Ceramic pieces can break leading to catastrophic failure. This occurs in about 2% of the implants placed. They may also cause an audible, high pitched squeaking noise with activity. Metal-on-metal arthroplasty releases metal debris into the body raising concerns about the potential dangers of these accumulating over time. Highly cross linked polyethylene is not as strong as regular polyethylene. These plastic liners can crack or break free of the metal shell that holds them.\n\n===Loosening===\n[[File:Hip joint aseptic loosening ar1938-1.png|thumb|upright|Hip prosthesis displaying aseptic loosening (arrows)]]\n[[File:Hip prosthesis zones by DeLee and Charnley system, and Gruen system.jpg|thumb|210px|[[Hip prosthesis zones]] according to DeLee and Charnley,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Adult Hip, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-fwULYB1gJIC&pg=PA958|author=John J.

Stainless steel is no longer used. All implants release their constituent ions into the blood. Typically these are excreted in the urine, but in certain individuals the ions can accumulate in the body. In implants which involve metal-on-metal contact, microscopic fragments of [[cobalt]] and [[chromium]] can be absorbed into the person's bloodstream. There are reports of [[cobalt toxicity]] with hip replacement.<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Tower SS | title = Cobalt Toxicity in Two Hip Replacement Patients | url = http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/bulletins/docs/b2010_14.pdf | work = State of Alaska Epidemiology Bulletin No. 14 | date = May 28, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=reuters-20120329/>\n\n===Nerve palsy===\nPost operative sciatic nerve palsy is another possible complication. The incidence of this complication is low. Femoral nerve palsy is another but much more rare complication. Both of these will typically resolve over time, but the healing process is slow. Patients with pre-existing nerve injury are at greater risk of experiencing this complication and are also slower to recover.\n\n===Chronic pain===\nA few patients who have had a hip replacement suffer chronic pain after the surgery. Groin pain can develop if the muscle that raises the hip ([[iliopsoas]]) rubs against the edge of the acetabular cup. Bursitis can develop at the trochanter where a surgical scar crosses the bone, or if the femoral component used pushes the leg out to the side too far. Also some patients can experience pain in cold or damp weather.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Incision made in the front of the hip (anterior approach) can cut a nerve running down the thigh leading to numbness in the thigh and occasionally chronic pain at the point where the nerve was cut (a neuroma).\n\n===Death===\nThe rate of [[perioperative mortality]] for elective hip replacements is significantly less than 1%.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cot\u00e9, John|title=Hip replacement is not viewed as high-risk surgery; Death is rare, but underlying medical condition a factor|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=July 22, 2007|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2007-07-22/news/17254067_1_hip-replacement-hip-replacement-surgery-blood-clot}}</ref><ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/588980 Medscape Conference Coverage], American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) 2009 Annual Meeting, AAOS 2009: Certain Factors Increase Risk for Death After Total Hip Arthroplasty, Barbara Boughton, March 3, 2009.</ref>\n\n===Metal-on-metal hip implant failure===\n{{See also|Implant failure}}\nBy 2010, reports in the orthopaedic literature increasingly cited the problem of early failure of metal on metal prostheses in a small percentage of patients.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mikhael MM, Hanssen AD, Sierra RJ | title = Failure of metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty mimicking hip infection.

His work in the field of [[tribology]] resulted in a design that almost completely replaced the other designs by the 1970s.  Charnley's design consisted of three parts:\n\n# [[Stainless Steel|stainless steel]] one-piece femoral stem and head\n# [[polyethylene]] (originally [[Teflon]]), acetabular component, both of which were fixed to the bone using\n# [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] (acrylic) [[bone cement]]\n\nThe replacement joint, which was known as the Low Friction [[Arthroplasty]], was lubricated with [[synovial fluid]]. The small femoral head ({{convert|7/8|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.\n\nThe Exeter hip stem was developed in the United Kingdom during the same time as the Charnley device. Its development occurred following a collaboration between Orthopaedic Surgeon [[Robin Ling]] and [[University of Exeter]] engineer [[Clive Lee]] and it was first implanted at the Princess Elizabeth Orthopaedic Hospital in Exeter in 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/20/robin-ling-obituary|title=Robin Ling obituary|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2017|first=A John|last=Timperley| name-list-format = vanc |access-date=22 October 2017}}</ref> The Exeter Hip is a cemented device, but with a slightly different stem geometry. Both designs have shown excellent long-term durability when properly placed and are still widely used in slightly modified versions.\n\nEarly implant designs had the potential to loosen from their attachment to the bones, typically becoming painful ten to twelve years after placement. In addition, erosion of the bone around the implant was seen on x-rays. Initially, surgeons believed this was caused by an abnormal reaction to the cement holding the implant in place. That belief prompted a search for an alternative method to attach the implants. The Austin Moore device had a small hole in the stem into which bone graft was placed before implanting the stem. It was hoped bone would then grow through the window over time and hold the stem in position. Success was unpredictable and the fixation not very robust. In the early 1980s, surgeons in the United States applied a coating of small beads to the Austin Moore device and implanted it without cement. The beads were constructed so that gaps between beads matched the size of the pores in native bone. Over time, bone cells from the patient would grow into these spaces and fix the stem in position. The stem was modified slightly to fit more tightly into the femoral canal, resulting in the Anatomic Medullary Locking (AML) stem design. With time, other forms of stem surface treatment and stem geometry have been developed and improved.\n\nInitial hip designs were made of a one-piece femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral stem and separate head piece. Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the stem) and to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.\n\nTo combat loosening caused by polyethylene wear debris, hip manufacturers developed improved and novel materials for the acetabular liners. [[Ceramic]] heads mated with regular polyethylene liners or a ceramic liner were the first significant alternative. Metal liners to mate with a metal head were also developed. At the same time these designs were being developed, the problems that caused polyethylene wear were determined and manufacturing of this material improved. Highly crosslinked UHMWPE was introduced in the late 1990s. The most recent data comparing the various bearing surfaces has shown no clinically significant differences in their performance. Potential early problems with each material are discussed below. Performance data after 20 or 30 years may be needed to demonstrate significant differences in the devices. All newer materials allow use of larger diameter femoral heads. Use of larger heads significantly decreases the chance of the hip dislocating, which remains the greatest complication of the surgery.\n\nWhen currently available implants are used, cemented stems tend to have a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone who are at risk of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several incisions, defined by their relation to the gluteus medius. The approaches are posterior (Moore), lateral (Hardinge or Liverpool),<ref name=\"pmid9498150\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pai VS | title = A comparison of three lateral approaches in primary total hip replacement | journal = International Orthopaedics | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 393\u20138 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9498150 | pmc = 3619565 | doi = 10.1007/s002640050193 | url = http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20020108155635/http://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00264/bibs/8021006/80210393.htm | archive-date = 2002-01-08 }}</ref> antero-lateral (Watson-Jones),<ref name=\"titleAnterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterolateral_approach_to_hip_joint_watson_jones |title=Anterolateral Approach to Hip Joint: (Watson Jones) \u2013 Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |access-date=2007-11-26 |website=}}</ref> anterior (Smith-Petersen)<ref name=\"titleAnterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) - Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/anterior_approach_to_the_hip_smith_peterson |title=Anterior Approach to the Hip (Smith Petersen) \u2013 Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics |access-date=2007-11-26 |website=}}</ref> and [[greater trochanter]] osteotomy. There is no compelling evidence in the literature for any particular approach.\n\n===Posterior approach===\nThe ''posterior'' (''Moore'' or ''Southern'') ''approach'' accesses the joint and capsule through the back, taking [[piriformis muscle]] and the short external rotators of the femur. This approach gives excellent access to the acetabulum and femur and preserves the hip [[Abduction (kinesiology)|abductors]] and thus minimizes the risk of abductor dysfunction post operatively. It has the advantage of becoming a more extensile approach if needed. Critics cite a higher dislocation rate, although repair of the capsule, piriformis and the short external rotators along with use of modern large diameter head balls reduces this risk. Limited evidence suggests that the posterior approach may cause less nerve damage.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Jolles BM, Bogoch ER | title = Posterior versus lateral surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty in adults with osteoarthritis | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD003828 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16856020 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd003828.pub3 }}</ref>\n\n===Lateral approach===\nThe ''lateral approach'' is also commonly used for hip replacement. The approach requires elevation of the hip abductors ([[gluteus medius]] and [[gluteus minimus]]) to access the joint. The abductors may be lifted up by osteotomy of the greater trochanter and reapplying it afterwards using wires (as per Charnley),{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} or may be divided at their tendinous portion, or through the functional tendon (as per Hardinge) and repaired using [[surgical suture|sutures]]. Although this approach has a lower dislocation risk than the posterior approach, critics note that occasionally the abductor muscles do not heal back on, leading to pain and weakness which is often very difficult to treat.\n\n=== Antero-lateral approach ===\nThe ''anterolateral approach'' develops the interval between the [[tensor fasciae latae]] and the gluteus medius. The Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and hip capsule are detached from the anterior (front) for the greater trochanter and femoral neck and then repaired with heavy suture after the replacement of the joint.\n\n=== Anterior approach ===\nThe ''anterior approach'' uses an interval between the [[sartorius muscle]] and tensor fasciae latae. Dr. Joel Matta and Dr. Bert Thomas have adapted this approach, which was commonly used for pelvic fracture repair surgery, for use when performing hip replacement.

Options exist for different people and indications.

Cartilage and bone are removed from the acetabulum and the acetabular cup is attached using friction or cement. Some acetabular cups are one piece, while others are modular. One-piece (monobloc) shells are either [[Ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene|UHMWPE]] or metal, they have their articular surface machined on the inside surface of the cup and do not rely on a locking mechanism to hold a liner in place. A monobloc polyethylene cup is cemented in place while a metal cup is held in place by a metal coating on the outside of the cup. Modular cups consist of two pieces, a shell and liner. The shell is made of metal; the outside has a porous coating while the inside contains a locking mechanism designed to accept a liner. Two types of porous coating used to form a friction fit are [[sintering|sintered]] beads and a [[foam metal]] design to mimic the trabeculae of cancellous bone and initial stability is influenced by under-reaming and insertion force.<ref name=\"Amirouche\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Amirouche F, Solitro G, Broviak S, Gonzalez M, Goldstein W, Barmada R | title = Factors influencing initial cup stability in total hip arthroplasty | journal = Clinical Biomechanics | volume = 29 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201385 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25266242 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinbiomech.2014.09.006 }}</ref> Permanent fixation is achieved as bone grows onto or into the porous coating. Screws can be used to lag the shell to the bone providing even more fixation. Polyethylene liners are placed into the shell and connected by a rim locking mechanism; ceramic and metal liners are attached with a [[Morse taper]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Femoral component===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The femoral component is the component that fits in the [[femur]] (thigh bone). Bone is removed and the femur is shaped to accept the femoral stem with attached prosthetic femoral head (ball). There are two types of fixation: cemented and uncemented. Cemented stems use acrylic [[bone cement]] to form a mantle between the stem and to the bone. Uncemented stems use friction, shape and surface coatings to stimulate bone to remodel and bond to the implant. Stems are made of multiple materials (titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and polymer composites) and they can be monolithic or modular. Modular components consist of different head dimensions and/or modular neck orientations; these attach via a taper similar to a [[Morse taper]]. These options allow for variability in leg length, offset and version. Femoral heads are made of metal or ceramic material. Metal heads, made of cobalt chromium for hardness, are machined to size and then polished to reduce wear of the socket liner. Ceramic heads are more smooth than polished metal heads, have a lower coefficient of friction than a cobalt chrome head, and in theory will wear down the socket liner more slowly. As of early 2011, follow-up studies in patients have not demonstrated significant reductions in wear rates between the various types of femoral heads on the market. Ceramic implants are more brittle and may break after being implanted.\n\n===Articular interface===\n{{Original research|section|date=April 2016}}The articular interface is not part of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and socket joint. Size, material properties and machining [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]] at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are {{convert|28|mm|abbr=on}}, {{convert|32|mm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|36|mm|abbr=on}}. While {{convert|22.25|mm|frac=8|abbr=on}} was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54&nbsp;mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled to reduce the amount of wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.\n\nDual mobility hip replacements reduce the risk of dislocation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blakeney WG, Epinette JA, Vendittoli PA | title = Dual mobility total hip arthroplasty: should everyone get one? | journal = EFORT Open Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 541\u2013547 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31598332 | pmc = 6771074 | doi = 10.1302/2058-5241.4.180045 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Horriat S, Haddad FS | title = Dual mobility in hip arthroplasty: What evidence do we need? | journal = Bone & Joint Research | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 508\u2013510 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30258569 | pmc = 6138808 | doi = 10.1302/2046-3758.78.BJR-2018-0217 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Blakeney WG, Epinette JA, Vendittoli PA | title = Dual mobility total hip arthroplasty: should everyone get one? | journal = EFORT Open Reviews | volume = 4 | issue = 9 | pages = 541\u2013547 | date = September 2019 | pmid = 31598332 | pmc = 6771074 | doi = 10.1302/2058-5241.4.180045 }}</ref>\n\n==Configuration==\nPost-operative [[projectional radiography]] is routinely performed to ensure proper configuration of hip prostheses.\n\nThe direction of the acetabular cup influences the range of motion of the leg, and also affects the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt/> For this purpose, the ''acetabular inclination'' and the ''acetabular anteversion'' are measurements of cup angulation in the [[coronal plane]] and the [[sagittal plane]], respectively.\n<gallery widths=\"230\">\nFile:Acetabular inclination of hip prosthesis.jpg|Acetabular inclination.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> This parameter is calculated on an anteroposterior radiograph as the angle between a line through the lateral and medial margins of the acetabular cup and the ''transischial line'' which is tangential to the inferior margins of the [[ischium]] bones.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vanrusselt J, Vansevenant M, Vanderschueren G, Vanhoenacker F | title = Postoperative radiograph of the hip arthroplasty: what the radiologist should know | journal = Insights into Imaging | volume = 6 | issue = 6 | pages = 591\u2013600 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26487647 | pmc = 4656234 | doi = 10.1007/s13244-015-0438-5 }}</ref>\nFile:Range of acetabular inclination.png|Acetabular inclination is normally between 30 and 50\u00b0.<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> A larger angle increases the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p431c8258e7ac3/hip-arthroplasty.html|title=Hip - Arthroplasty - Normal and abnormal imaging findings| first1 = Iain | last1 = Watt | first2 = Susanne | last2 = Boldrik | first3 = Evert | last3 = van Langelaan | first4 = Robin | last4 = Smithuis | name-list-format = vanc |website=Radiology Assistant |access-date=2017-05-21 }}</ref>\nFile:Acetabular anteversion of hip prosthesis.jpg|Acetabular anteversion.<ref name=\"ShinLee2015\"/> This parameter is calculated on a lateral radiograph as the angle between the [[transverse plane]] and a line going through the (anterior and posterior) margins of the acetabular cup.<ref name=\"ShinLee2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shin WC, Lee SM, Lee KW, Cho HJ, Lee JS, Suh KT | title = The reliability and accuracy of measuring anteversion of the acetabular component on plain anteroposterior and lateral radiographs after total hip arthroplasty | journal = The Bone & Joint Journal | volume = 97-B | issue = 5 | pages = 611\u20136 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25922453 | doi = 10.1302/0301-620X.97B5.34735 }}</ref>\nFile:Range of acetabular anteversion.png|Acetabular anteversion is normally between 5 and 25\u00b0.<ref name=Watt/> An anteversion below or above this range increases the risk of dislocation.<ref name=Watt/> There is an [[intra-individual variability]] in this method because the pelvis may be tilted in various degrees in relation to the transverse plane.<ref name=Watt/>\nFile:Leg length discrepancy after hip replacement.jpg|''Leg length discrepancy'' after hip replacement is calculated as the vertical distance between the middle of the minor trochanters, using the acetabular tear drops<ref name=Vanrusselt2015/> or the transischial line<ref name=Watt/> as references for the horizontal plane.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]: A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role. On why Bassinger was perfect for the role, Johns said, \"Immediately... I knew she was Courtney. She has the humor, she has the enthusiasm, the energy, the innate optimism, and Brec really embodies who Stargirl is\".<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In November 2018, the following roles were cast: Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]],<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]], and Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> The next month, [[Joy Osmanski]] was cast as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]], [[Neil Hopkins]] was cast as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \u201cCrusher\u201d Crock / Sportsmaster]], and [[Nelson Lee]] was cast as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]], members of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> In January 2019, [[Luke Wilson]] was cast as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> Cameron Gellman joined the cast as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]] the next month,<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> along with [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore,<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /> [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]],<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Trae Romano as Mike Dugan, and Hunter Sansone in an undisclosed role rounding out the cast.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\nIn December 2018, the following members of the [[Justice Society of America]] were cast, all recurring roles: [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]],<ref name=\"McHale\" /> [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]],<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" /> Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]],<ref name=\"Stapf\" /> and [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]].<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> In February 2019, Jake Austin Walker was cast in an undisclosed role and Meg Delacy was cast as Cindy Burman.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" /> In April 2019, Hina Khan was cast in an undisclosed role said to be a principal.<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming had began by March 14, 2019,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> with [[Glen Winter]] directing the pilot.<ref name=\"Winter\" /> Filming occurs throughout the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], including: [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]], [[Virginia\u2013Highland]], [[Duluth, Georgia|Duluth]], [[Lithia Springs, Georgia|Lithia Springs]], [[Dallas, Georgia|Dallas]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilmingStart\" /> [[Marietta Square]], [[West End, Atlanta|West End]], [[Westlake High School (Georgia)|Westlake High School]], the Atlanta Center for Medical Research,<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming2\" /> Campbell Middle School, [[Paulding County, Georgia|Paulding County]], [[Smyrna, Georgia|Smyrna]], [[Arbor Place]] Mall, [[Vinings, Georgia|Vinings]],<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming3\" /> [[Mableton, Georgia|Mableton]], and [[Douglas County High School (Douglasville, Georgia)|Douglas County High School]].<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming4\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn June 2019, [[Pinar Toprak]] revealed she would be composing for the series.<ref name=\"Toprak\" />\n\n==Release==\n''Stargirl'' is scheduled to begin airing on DC Universe on May 18, 2020.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" /> The series was originally intended to begin airing on May 11, 2020.<ref name=\"OriginalReleaseDate\" /> In November 2019, it was announced that [[The CW]] would broadcast each episode the day after it premieres on the streaming service, with each episode available to stream on The CW's online platforms after its broadcast.<ref name=\"The CW\" /> It will start airing on The CW on May 19, 2020, at 8 pm.<ref name=\"NewRelease\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nOn December 7, 2019, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"FirstTrailer\" />\n\n==Arrowverse==\n{{Main|Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)}}\nStargirl and her team were briefly introduced in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" in January 2020.

In April 2020, Johns said, \"right now the main concern is making sure that this show is great, that these characters are great, that they have their own stories and they get the proper screen time and the proper episodes to develop on their own. So hopefully in the future we can do something fun, but the first season is all about making sure that ''Stargirl'' is the best show it can possibly be.\" Bassinger added that there had already been preliminary discussion about crossing over with ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', and she was hopeful to be able to crossover with [[Melissa Benoist]] on ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\">{{cite web |last1=Patten |first1=Dominic |title=Geoff Johns To Write & Produce \u2018Stargirl\u2019 Series For DC Universe \u2013 Comic-Con |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/geoff-johns-stargirl-tv-series-dc-universe-greg-berlanti-wbtv-comic-con-1202429776/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=July 19, 2018 |date=July 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"LegendsStargirl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/legends-tomorrow-legion-doom-season-913953|title=Comic-Con: ''Legends of Tomorrow'' to Tackle Legion of Doom Villain Team In Season 2|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|last=Bucksbaum|first=Sydney|date=July 23, 2016|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bassinger\">{{cite web |last1=Boucher |first1=Geoff |title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Discovered: Warner Bros Takes Shine To Brec Bassinger As DC Universe Superhero |url=https://deadline.com/2018/09/stargirl-brec-bassinger-dc-universe-series-1202468446/ |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=September 20, 2018 |date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Washington\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2018/11/02/stargirl-casts-anjelika-washington-in-undisclosed-dc-role/|title='Stargirl' Casts Anjelika Washington in Undisclosed DC Role|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/stargirl-yvette-monreal-christopher-james-baker-set-as-regulars-in-dc-universe-series-1202510976/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Yvette Monreal & Christopher James Baker Set As Regulars In DC Universe Series|last=Petski|first=Denise|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=November 29, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McHale\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/joel-mchale-starman-dc-universe-stargirl-exclusive-1203087415/|title=Joel McHale Cast as Starman in DC Universe\u2019s \u2018Stargirl\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|last=Turchiano|first=Danielle|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=December 12, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Ferrigno\">{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/12/13/stargirl-casts-hourman-lou-ferrigno-jr-dc-universe/|title=Stargirl Casts Lou Ferrigno Jr. as Hourman, Founding Member of JSA|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Stapf\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tvinsider.com/738208/dc-universe-stargirl-wildcat-brian-stapf/|title=DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Casts Brian Stapf as Wildcat|last=Holbrook|first=Damian|work=[[TV Insider]]|date=December 13, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/12/17/stargirl-henry-thomas-mid-nite-dc-universe/|title=DC Universe's Stargirl casts Haunting of Hill House star as the JSA's Dr. Mid-Nite|last=Agard|first=Chancellor|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 17, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/12/stargirl-casting-meet-three-members-of-injustice-society-1202524168/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casting: Meet Three Members Of Injustice Society|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 20, 2018|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Wilson\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/01/stargirl-luke-wilson-dc-comics-geoff-johns-1202531355/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019: Luke Wilson Joins Cast Of DC Universe Series|last=Boucher|first=Geoff|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=January 8, 2019|accessdate=January 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Winter\">{{cite web|url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/01/10/arrow-veteran-glen-winter-to-direct-dc-universes-stargirl-pilot/|title='Arrow' Veteran Glen Winter To Direct DC Universe's 'Stargirl' Pilot|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|work=Comicbook.com|date=January 11, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\">{{cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-dc-universe-series-jake-austin-walker-and-meg-delacy-1202549066/|title='Stargirl': DC Universe Series Adds Jake Austin Walker and Meg DeLacy |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=February 4, 2019 |accessdate=April 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Gellman\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/02/stargirl-casts-cameron-gellman-carmela-zumbado-you-1202561735/|title=\u2018Stargirl\u2019 Casts Cameron Gellman;

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl. Bassinger added the series followed the comic ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' more \"in that she's young, high school, naive, which I wanted to bring that into this version of Stargirl.\"<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Cameron Gellman as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]:<br />Courtney's stepfather, the former sidekick to Starman (when he was known as Stripesy), and a mechanic who pilots a 15-foot robot of his own creation.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> He is a member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore: Courtney's mother and wife of Pat Dugan striving to balance her work and home life.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]]: A member of the Injustice Society.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]]: A member of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Joy Osmanski]] as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]]: A member of the Injustice Society who hunts the world's most dangerous humans.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Neil Hopkins]] as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \"Crusher\" Crock / Sportsmaster]]: A member of the Injustice Society who feels all of his targets are part of a game to win.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Nelson Lee]] as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]]: A member of the Injustice Society and a controversial scientist who hides his face and experiments on himself and his patients.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Hunter Sansone<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* Trae Romano as Mike Dugan: Pat Dugan's son and Courtney's stepbrother.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America who used an anti-gravity cosmic staff that Courtney finds.<ref name=\"McHale\" />\n* [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is \"a master chemist and adrenaline junkie\" with the ability to acquire super-strength for one hour a day.<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" />\n* Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a former heavyweight boxer.<ref name=\"Stapf\" />\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a detective and a brilliant and forward-thinking medical pioneer.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* Jake Austin Walker<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Meg DeLacy as Cindy Burman: The daughter of Dragon King and the most popular student at Blue Valley High who is determined to follow in her father's footsteps.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Hina Khan as a principal<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#12223A |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Pilot\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuuwJytAyi9/|title=IT.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role.
