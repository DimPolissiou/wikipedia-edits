Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support [[V. V.

Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The Congress Party won a reduced majority for the Lok Sabha in these elections owing to widespread disenchantment over rising prices of commodities, unemployment, economic stagnation and a food crisis. Gandhi herself was elected to Lok Sabha from the [[Raebareli (Lok Sabha constituency)|Raebareli constituency]].

Following the 1967 elections, Indira Gandhi gradually started moving towards socialist policies. In 1969, she fell out with senior Congress party leaders on a number of issues. Chief among them was the decision by Indira to support [[V. V.

The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections.

Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry.

[[Indian National Congress]] formed the government with the help of one [[Bahujan Samaj Party|BSP]] MLA and one [[Samajwadi Party|SP]] MLA and other independent MLAs.\n\n[[Jyotiraditya Scindia]] had asked [[Rahul Gandhi]], then Congress President to make him either Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister or the President of the [[Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee]], but he denied and made [[Kamal Nath]] as Chief Minister. \n==Crisis==\nOn 10 March 2020, Scindia suddenly went to meet [[Narendra Modi]], Prime Minister of India and [[Amit Shah]], Home Minister of India. After meeting them, at around 11:30 am, he resigned from the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party, saying that he felt very guilty while working for Congress.<ref>Jyotiraditya M.

Throughout his [[press conference]], he didn't mention the names of the [[Nehru-Gandhi Family]]. After joining the party, he was given the ticket of [[Rajya Sabha]] from Madhya Pradesh by [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]]. \n\nBoth the parties have reached Supreme Court to ask for a floor test in Madhya Pradesh and the Supreme Court said that the floor test in [[Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] should be done on 20 March 2020 by 5:00 pm. On 20 March 2020, at around 12:00 pm, during a press conference, Chief Minister [[Kamal Nath]] resigned as CM.

[[Indian National Congress]] formed the government with the help of one [[Bahujan Samaj Party|BSP]] MLA and one [[Samajwadi Party|SP]] MLA and other independent MLAs.\n\n[[Jyotiraditya Scindia]] had asked [[Rahul Gandhi]], then Congress President to make him either Chief Minister, Deputy Chief Minister or the President of the [[Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee]], but he denied and made [[Kamal Nath]] as Chief Minister. \n==Crisis==\nOn 10 March 2020, Scindia suddenly went to meet [[Narendra Modi]], Prime Minister of India and [[Amit Shah]], Home Minister of India. After meeting them, at around 11:30 am, he resigned from the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party, saying that he felt very guilty while working for Congress.<ref>Jyotiraditya M. Scindia (@JM_Scindia) Tweeted:\nhttps://twitter.com/JM_Scindia/status/1237266942961967104?s=20</ref>\n\nNext day, at around 3:00 pm, he joined [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] in the presence of [[Jagat Prakash Nadda]], National President of [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. \n\nAfter joining the party, he slammed [[Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh]], [[Kamal Nath]] and other [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] leaders for not giving the importance in the party. Throughout his [[press conference]], he didn't mention the names of the [[Nehru-Gandhi Family]]. After joining the party, he was given the ticket of [[Rajya Sabha]] from Madhya Pradesh by [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]]. \n\nBoth the parties have reached Supreme Court to ask for a floor test in Madhya Pradesh and the Supreme Court said that the floor test in [[Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly]] should be done on 20 March 2020 by 5:00 pm. On 20 March 2020, at around 12:00 pm, during a press conference, Chief Minister [[Kamal Nath]] resigned as CM. After that, on 23 March 2020, [[Shivraj Singh Chouhan]] took oath as CM.\n\n===List of Members who Resigned===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! S.No\n! Constituency\n!

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles. The album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier also became hugely popular on the new MTV cable channel. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The sexually suggestive title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier ended up leading his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half-empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in the spring of 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles. The album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signature songs. Squier also became hugely popular on the new MTV cable channel. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The sexually suggestive title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier ended up leading his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - who had recently produced Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> ''Signs of Life'' finally came in September 1984 and brought Squier his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. The album saw him melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; on some occasions he played for half-empty stadiums during the Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans. Squier removed the video from MTV's rotation, but the damage was already done.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout!

The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews. He also supported the Group for the East End and its native planting programs on eastern Long Island.<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Post|date=May 14, 2000|url=https://nypost.com/2000/05/14/rocker-billys-a-country-squier/|title=Rocker Billy's A Country \u2018Squier\u2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=New York Social Diary|date=September 2, 2015|url=http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/guest-diary/2015/end-of-summer-doings-at-madoo|title=End of Summer Doings at Madoo}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Billy Squier discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n*''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' (1981)\n*''[[Emotions in Motion]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' (1984)\n*''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'' (1989)\n*''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]]'' (1993)\n*''[[Happy Blue (Billy Squier album)|Happy Blue]]'' (1998)\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\n* ''[[A Rock and Roll Christmas]]'' (Various Artists Compilation) (1994)\n* ''16 Strokes: The Best of Billy Squier'' (1995)\n* ''Reach for the Sky: The Anthology'' (1996) (PolyGram)\n* ''Classic Masters'' (2002)\n* ''Absolute Hits'' (2005)\n* ''Essential Billy Squier'' (2011)\n* ''ICON'' (2013)\n\n=== Live albums ===\n* ''King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Billy Squier'' (1996)\n* ''Live In The Dark'' (DVD)\n\n===Non-album soundtrack contributions===\n*''Fast Times (The Best Years Of Our Lives)'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Fast Times At Ridgemont High]]'' (1982)\n*''On Your Own'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1984)\n*''Shake Down'' - from the Motion Picture Soundtrack ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<!--unused<ref name=\"parker\">{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=Martha, Martha, Martha! 35 Years Later, Original VJ Quinn Remembers MTV's Early Days|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/martha-martha-martha-35-years-later-original-vj-quinn-remembers-mtvs-early-days-042906236.html|website=Yahoo!

The '''Westate Wildcats''' were established and played out of the 800-seat [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Interest in basketball steadily grew throughout the community and in 1984 the Westate Wildcats became the '''Perth Wildcats'''. The Wildcats have gone on to become the highest-drawing and most successful team in the league, having won NBL championships in [[1990 NBL season|1990]], [[1991 NBL season|1991]], [[1995 NBL season|1995]], [[1999\u20132000 NBL season|2000]], [[2009\u201310 NBL season|2010]], [[2013\u201314 NBL season|2014]], [[2015\u201316 NBL season|2016]], [[2016\u201317 NBL season|2017]], [[2018\u201319 NBL season|2019]] and [[2019\u201320 NBL season|2020]], placing the team five ahead of [[Melbourne United]], who has five championships. Since 1987, the Wildcats have made 34-straight post-season appearances, an accomplishment matched by no other professional sports team in Australia.\n\n==The Wildcats in Perth==\nThe Wildcats are the city's only major professional basketball team and are one of [[Western Australia]]'s major summer sport teams, along with the [[Perth Scorchers]] (cricket, [[Big Bash League]]), the [[Western Australia cricket team|Western Warriors]] (cricket, [[Sheffield Shield]]) and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] (soccer, [[A-League]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/football/a-league/teams/perth/was-three-biggest-summer-sport-teams-sitting-atop-their-respective-competition-tables/news-story/ea4bf5390a3df8aa187652a8822ed5f3|title=WA's three biggest summer sport teams sitting atop their respective competition tables|work=PerthNow.com.au|date=18 November 2014|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Wildcats players are active members of the Perth community, with the off-court structures aimed at making the players better people so that they could become better players cited as the biggest key to success. There are personal qualities demanded from owner [[Jack Bendat]] down through every rank of the organisation, and being a proactive part of community work, particularly through its InspiRED program, is pivotal. The public support for the Wildcats has been deemed remarkable, particularly the way fans have bought into the brand to create the \"Red Army\". The Wildcats' sturdy culture has long been built on a history of winning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Steve|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/basketball/why-perth-wildcats-are-worlds-greatest-team-ng-ya-134739|title=Why Perth Wildcats are world's greatest team|work=TheWest.com.au|date=2 January 2016|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> In 2009, after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Jack Bendat and then-chief executive officer Nick Marvin transformed the franchise, focusing on being family-friendly and engaging with children in Western Australia. From a zero-tolerance swearing policy to always making eye contact and acknowledging supporters, players have a 350-hour community engagement obligation, 200 hours above what the collective bargaining agreement requires. In 2009, instead of doing 20 school visits per year, the Wildcats started doing 100. This increased to 200 school visits in 2010, and the year after it rose again to 220. Under Marvin, the philosophy was: the more engaged the Wildcats were with the West Australian community, the more fans they accumulated. As a result, they are the most successful franchise in NBL history and one of the most competitive professional sporting teams in the world, with crowds at [[Perth Arena]] the best and unmatched in the NBL.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Clint|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-01/how-perth-wildcats-became-one-of-australias-greatest-sport-teams/10853814|title=How the Perth Wildcats became one of the most successful franchises in Australian sport|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Wildcats have consistently enjoyed large home crowds since moving into Perth Arena in 2012, resulting in arguably the greatest home-court advantage in the NBL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/the-nbl-home-court-advantage/ |title=The NBL home court advantage |date=7 January 2016 |website=NBL.com.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, the Wildcats became the first NBL franchise to break the 10,000-member barrier.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/perth-wildcats/perth-wildcats-break-10000-member-barrier/ |title=Perth Wildats break 10,000 member barrier |date=18 January 2017 |website=Wildcats.com.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> As a result of their large fan base, known as the \"Red Army\", the Wildcats have set numerous record sell-out crowds at Perth Arena.

It took another three years of lobbying by the Perth basketball community, led by personalities like Gordon Ellis, before a team in Western Australia became a reality. Formed in 1982 as the '''Westate Wildcats''', the Wildcats became the first, and so far only, Western Australian team to compete in the NBL. The team was initially coached by Henry Daigle and captained by [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]], and they played out of [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. They struggled to make an impact in their first season, finishing 10th with a 10\u201316 win/loss record.\n\nGordon Ellis took over as coach in 1983, but a 6\u201316 record ensued, with the Wildcats finishing well out of the finals race in 13th position. In 1984, the team was renamed the '''Perth Wildcats''', but with coach Lynn Massey at the helm, the Wildcats finished on the bottom of the ladder (16th) with only three wins\u2014an all-time low for the team.\n\nA fourth coach in Jay Brehmer came into the team for the 1985 season. Brehmer and imports Dan Clausen and Roland Brooks looked to lead the Wildcats to a finals berth for the first time, but they narrowly missed out on the post-season with a 13\u201313 record and an eighth-place finish. The Wildcats suffered a major setback in 1986 with the loss of the high-scoring Roland Brooks, after he suffered a season-ending injury just 10 games into the season. Without their star import, the Wildcats struggled to be competitive as they finished the season in 12th place with an 8\u201318 record.\n\n===1987\u20132003: First Championship era===\n====1987: First trip to the finals====\nMany changes occurred in 1987. Most significantly, the team moved from the small confines of Perry Lakes Stadium to what was known in those days as the Perth Superdrome (now [[HBF Stadium]]). The Superdrome was capable of housing 5,000 people, compared to the 800-seat Perry Lakes Stadium. Also in 1987, still captained by Mike Ellis, the Perth Wildcats introduced players to the roster that would become household names such as [[Kendal Pinder]], [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]], [[Cal Bruton]] (player/coach), [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]], [[Eric Watterson]] and [[Trevor Torrance]].\n\nThe new talent paid off immediately for the Wildcats as the team made the finals for the first time. In the first two stages of the finals, the Wildcats defeated the [[Canberra Cannons]] and minor premier [[Adelaide 36ers]] to suddenly find themselves in the Grand Final series against the [[Brisbane Bullets]]. The Wildcats were repeatedly referred to as the 'Cinderella' story as they entered the season having finished in third-last position in 1986, only to go on to make the Grand Final after finishing the 1987 regular season in fourth position with a 19\u20137 record. The 'run, stun and have some fun' style of play<ref name=thirty-straight>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/perth-wildcats-30-and-counting/ |title=Perth Wildcats: 30 and counting |date=7 February 2016 |website=NBL.com.au |access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref> that had been implemented that season had worked wonders until the Grand Final series. The series was a promoter's dream: East Coast versus West; solid fundamentals versus \"run and gun\"; future Hall of Fame members on both sides on the floor; and two coaches who couldn't stand each other (Brian Kerle versus Cal Bruton).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.basketball.net.au/back-in-the-day-article-fifty-one/ |title=Back in the day article fifty-one |date=12 October 2010 |website=Basketball.net.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> The Bullets defeated the Wildcats by just one point in front of a sell-out Perth crowd in Game 1 of the three-match series, before claiming the Championship in Brisbane in Game 2 a few days later.\n\n====1990: First Championship====\nAfter 1988 and 1989 both resulted in losses to the [[North Melbourne Giants]] in the Semi-finals, the most exciting chapter in Wildcats history came in 1990 as prominent West Australian businessman [[Kerry Stokes]] purchased the franchise and decided to raise the team's profile to incredible heights by moving the home court to the iconic 8,000-seat [[Perth Entertainment Centre]].\n\nAfter retiring as a player following the 1989 season, [[Cal Bruton]] became the Wildcats' general manager in 1990. Eager for the team to win its first NBL Championship, Bruton embarked on an active recruiting campaign during the off-season; a recruiting campaign that saw the introduction of a player that is regularly referred to as the Wildcats' greatest: [[Ricky Grace|Ricky 'Amazing' Grace]]. Grace teamed-up with Mike Ellis to create a dominating backcourt. The 1990 season began with turmoil as coach [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]] was controversially fired after only two games, and was replaced by Cal Bruton. Despite the shaky start to the season, the Wildcats recovered to finish in fifth place with a 17\u20139 record. Entering the finals as underdogs, the Wildcats swept the [[Melbourne Tigers]] in the Elimination Finals and got their revenge over the North Melbourne Giants with a 2\u20131 victory in the Semi-finals to again face the [[Brisbane Bullets]] in their second Grand Final appearance.\n\nTens of thousands of people across Western Australia tuned into the live coverage to watch the Wildcats triumph 112\u2013106 in Game 1 of the Grand Final series in front of a sold-out Perth Entertainment Centre. Brisbane tied the series at 1\u20131 after winning Game 2 in convincing fashion at home, 106\u201390. In the deciding game also in Brisbane a few days later, the Wildcats blew the game wide open in the third quarter and were up by 20 points before the final term. They cruised to a 109\u201386 victory to claim their first NBL Championship. For his superb series, Grace was recognised as [[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|grand final MVP]]. Over the three games, Grace averaged 24.7 points per game.\n\n====1991: Back-to-back championships====\nIn controversial circumstances, Cal Bruton was not retained as coach despite leading the Wildcats to a championship in 1990. He was replaced by [[Murray Arnold]], a former assistant coach with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Arnold's style of game was focused on defence which was a significant change from the high scoring and entertaining style previously implemented under Bruton. In pursuit of back-to-back championships, the Wildcats strengthened their roster considerably in the off-season with the addition of future WA basketball legend [[Andrew Vlahov]] and Peter Hansen, an American who arrived via Venezuela, Spain and the [[Perry Lakes Hawks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/basketball/when-the-wildcats-were-was-kings-ng-ya-324152|title=When the Wildcats were WA's kings|work=TheWest.com.au|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nArnold's Wildcats were a highly successful team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22\u20134 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the [[Adelaide 36ers]] in the Semi-finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated [[Eastside Spectres]] in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had a unique opportunity to win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point in the history of the NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109\u201383). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86\u201381). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90\u201380) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.\n\nJust as Mike Ellis had hoped, he and the likes of Pinder, Crawford, Grace and Vlahov found themselves in the midst of a Perth Wildcats dynasty.\n\n====1993: Fourth Grand Final in seven years====\nAfter a down year in 1992 produced a quarter-final loss, three major personnel changes occurred heading into the 1993 season. Club legend and captain Mike Ellis retired after 12 seasons, Dr [[Adrian Hurley]] was appointed as the new head coach replacing Murray Arnold, and finally the Wildcats enticed two-time league MVP [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] to the team.\n\nWith new captain Andrew Vlahov at the helm, the Wildcats continued their on-court success to finish as minor premiers and make it through to another Grand Final series, this time against a [[Melbourne Tigers]] team led by [[Andrew Gaze]], [[Lanard Copeland]] and [[Mark Bradtke]]. The impending series is often described as the best Grand Final series in the history of the NBL. After splitting the first two games of the series, the championship came down to the final few seconds of Game 3 when Vlahov missed a three-point shot to tie the game with only seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_UGp_nR7bo|title=1993 NBL Grand Final|via=YouTube|date=4 August 2008|accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> Despite being on the losing team, Ricky Grace was named the MVP of the series after averaging 22.3 points per game over the three games.\n\n====1995: Third Championship====\n[[File:Perth Wildcats Champions 1995.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 1995 Championship-winning Wildcats]]\nFollowing a disappointing 1994 season, the Wildcats looked to recruit a pure sharp shooter to stretch opposing defenses and free up more room in the low post for the likes of Scott Fisher, James Crawford and Andrew Vlahov to operate in. [[Anthony Stewart (basketball)|Anthony Stewart]] was signed from the Hobart Tassie Devils to fill this role. Joining Stewart in the backcourt was Ricky Grace and [[Aaron Trahair]], while [[Martin Cattalini]] rounded out the eight-man rotation used by coach Adrian Hurley.\n\nThe Wildcats were highly successful in 1995, as coach Hurley guided the team to what was referred to as the 'Triple Crown'\u2014winning the pre-season competition, finishing minor premiers and then winning the NBL Championship. After defeating the Melbourne Tigers in the quarter-finals and the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats won through to their fifth Grand Final in nine years. In a rollercoaster Grand Final series against the [[North Melbourne Giants]], both teams won away contests to be level coming into the deciding Game 3. The Wildcats went on to overpower the Giants in Game 3 and recorded a comfortable 108\u201388 victory in claiming their third NBL title. Captain Andrew Vlahov was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 24 points per game over the three games.\n\nThe Wildcats' championship win booked themselves a trip to London to play in the [[McDonald's Championship]], an international tournament featuring the best clubs in the world. The Wildcats lost to the [[Houston Rockets]] 116\u201372 in their first game of the tournament, but managed to defeat [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] 93\u201386 in their second game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santamaria|first=Liam|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/perth-wildcats-vs-houston-rockets-oral-history/|title=PERTH WILDCATS VS HOUSTON ROCKETS: AN ORAL HISTORY|work=NBL.com.au|date=15 August 2017|accessdate=15 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1999/2000: Fourth Championship====\nFollowing four straight injury-plagued seasons that all resulted in early finals exists, the Wildcats geared up for a big season in [[1999\u20132000 NBL season|1999/2000]] behind stalwarts Andrew Vlahov, Ricky Grace, Scott Fisher and Anthony Stewart, as well as the up-and-coming [[James Harvey (basketball)|James Harvey]] and two-year centre [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]].

The new ownership duo proved to be an instant success with the Wildcats securing an unprecedented fourth championship, defeating the [[Victoria Titans]] in front of a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the Perth Entertainment Centre. The Wildcats swept the Grand Final series 2\u20130, winning Game 1 in Melbourne 84\u201378 before returning home to clinch the series with an 83\u201376 Game 2 win. After scoring a game-high 27 points in Game 2, Marcus Timmons was named MVP of the series. To top off the season, Paul Rogers became the first Wildcat to be honoured as the [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|regular-season MVP]].\n\n====2002/03: Seventh Grand Final in 17 years====\nIn 2002, club legend and captain Andrew Vlahov retired after 12 seasons, leaving Ricky Grace as the only remaining Wildcat from the team's halcyon days of the early to mid 1990s. Following the closure of the Perth Entertainment Centre, the Wildcats moved back in to their old home, the Superdrome (now [[HBF Stadium]]), for the 2002/03 season. The Perth Entertainment Centre was a popular venue for the Wildcats thanks to its central CBD location. The Superdrome, or Challenge Stadium as it became known, was a suburban-based arena and could only hold 5,000 compared to the 8,000-seat Perth Entertainment Centre.\n\nFollowing Vlahov's retirement, Grace became captain of the Wildcats for the 2002/03 season. Behind Grace and coach Alan Black, the Wildcats finished second on the ladder with a 22\u20138 record and advanced through to their seventh Grand Final series where they faced the [[Sydney Kings]]. In the championship series, the Wildcats were outclassed by the Kings, as they lost Game 1 in Sydney 98\u201394 before returning home and losing 117\u2013101 in Game 2. In addition to Grace, Alan Black's son, [[Stephen Black]], was also an important member of the Wildcats' 2003 grand final team, as was [[Tony Ronaldson]], [[Rob Feaster]], [[Matthew Burston]], [[Brett Wheeler]] and James Harvey.\n\n===2003\u20132009: Championship drought===\n====2003\u20132005: Coaching changes and Ricky Grace's final years====\nIn the days following their grand final loss to the Kings, the Wildcats decided not to renew Black's contract and parted ways with him for a second time\u2014he was sensationally sacked in 1990 after just one season as coach before being brought back in 1998 to replace the outgoing Adrian Hurley; Black led the team for six straight seasons and claimed one championship.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-04-11/ellis-favoured-as-perth-sacks-black/1834640 | title = Ellis favoured as Perth sacks Black | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 11 April 2003 | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref> Club legend Mike Ellis was appointed head coach for the 2003/04 season, but in his lone season as coach of the Wildcats, Ellis guided the team to their first losing season since 1986, as they finished in seventh spot with a 15\u201318 record and earned a quarter-final defeat.

In his first season as a Wildcat, Redhage averaged a team-best 20 points per game and led the Wildcats to an unlikely Semi-final appearance, where they were defeated by the eventual champion [[Melbourne Tigers]]. Redhage's excellent debut season earned him runner-up in the MVP voting. During the 2005/06 season, in February 2006, West Australian businessman [[Jack Bendat]] became the chairman and majority shareholder of the franchise. Although no longer the majority shareholder, Andrew Vlahov remained in control of the team as managing director.<ref name=atf>{{cite web | url = http://andthefoul.net/NBLwiki/index.php?Perth%20Wildcats | title = Perth Wildcats \u2013 NBL Wiki | work = AndTheFoul.net | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = McLean | first = Stuart | url = http://www.racingandsports.com.au/en/sports/-story-79869 | title = Bendat takes interest in NBL Wildcats | work = RacingAndSports.com.au | date = 22 February 2006 | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, Paul Rogers became the fifth player to captain the Wildcats. Rogers replaced Tony Ronaldson as captain for the 2006/07 season, despite Ronaldson continuing to play for the team. The Wildcats celebrated their 25th anniversary during the 2006/07 season and recorded their highest number of wins in a single season (23 wins), although historically they have recorded better win-loss ratios. Their season came to an end after being defeated by the [[Cairns Taipans]] 82\u201378 in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"atf\" /> For the second year in a row, Redhage led the Wildcats in scoring with 21.4 points per game.\n\nThe 2007/08 season saw the Wildcats return to the Semi-finals under coach Scott Fisher and captain Paul Rogers, but they again fell short of reaching the Grand Final, losing the best-of-three Semi-final series 2\u20131 to the [[Sydney Kings]]. On the season, Redhage averaged a career-best 22.9 points per game and set his career high for points in a game with 40 on 10 October 2007 against the [[Adelaide 36ers]].\n\nFollowing the 2007/08 season, head coach Scott Fisher departed the Wildcats in order to return to the United States for personal reasons, and was eventually replaced by his assistant, Connor Henry.<ref name=\"atf\" /> Another Quarter Final exist ensued for the Wildcats in 2008/09, leading to Henry's tenure lasting only one season.\n\nOver his first four seasons at the Wildcats, Redhage averaged at least 19 points and eight rebounds every year while earning a place in the [[All-NBL Team]] in four straight seasons. He was also a four-time Gordon Ellis Medalist during this time for being the Wildcats Club MVP and was donned the nickname of 'The Scoring Machine' due to his scoring prowess as a force on the interior.\n\n===2009\u2013present: Second Championship era===\n====2009/10: Fifth Championship====\nFollowing the 2008/09 season, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised a million dollars in sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stack | first = Patrick | url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/05/16/2573781.htm | title = The Wildcats on Borrowed Time | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 16 May 2009 | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref> The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the time that there would be no league in 2009/10.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stack | first = Patrick | url = http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2006/s2573634.htm | title = The Wildcats on Borrowed Time | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 15 May 2009 | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref> Collaborating with other clubs, the Wildcats helped reform the league.

One of [[Basketball Australia]]'s moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step with the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.botinagy.com/blog/the-new-nbl---what-it-means/ | title = The 'new NBL' \u2013 what it means | work = BotiNagy.com | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBeveridge was instrumental in compiling a new-look team where Shawn Redhage, [[Stephen Weigh]] and [[Brad Robbins]] were surrounded by proven NBL players [[Damian Martin]], Drew Williamson, [[Luke Schenscher]] and [[Martin Cattalini]], and rising stars [[Kevin Lisch]] and [[Jesse Wagstaff]].

After claiming the minor premiership and beating the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats came up against the [[Wollongong Hawks]] in their first Grand Final series since 2003. After Games 1 and 2 proved to be comfortable victories for each home team, the Wildcats found themselves down by as many as 11 points in the second quarter of Game 3, before Lisch exploded offensively to finish with 29 points in lifting the team to a record fifth NBL Championship with a 96\u201372 win.

At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals for the first time in 31 years seemed like a real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players.

trophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 2016/17 championship trophy]]\nAfter three years of finals action that included a losing grand final series in 1987, the team won back-to-back titles in 1990 and 1991 behind the likes of [[Ricky Grace]], [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] and [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]], and coaches [[Cal Bruton]] and [[Murray Arnold]]. It took four more years for the team's third NBL title in 1995, with coach [[Adrian Hurley]] and captain [[Andrew Vlahov]] leading the way. Five more years elapsed before the next championship came in the 1999/2000 season. Behind coach [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]] and centre [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]], and veterans Vlahov, Grace and [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] still around, the Wildcats won their fourth title.\n\nA large championship drought occurred between 2000/01 and 2008/09, but the Wildcats still made the finals each season. Then in 2009/10, the Wildcats became the undisputed greatest NBL franchise with a fifth championship. Coach Rob Beveridge and import [[Kevin Lisch]] were instrumental to the team's success that season, as was [[Shawn Redhage]] and [[Damian Martin]].\n\nTheir sixth championship came in 2013/14 thanks to coach [[Trevor Gleeson]] and imports [[Jermaine Beal]] and [[James Ennis (basketball)|James Ennis]]. In 2014/15, the Wildcats qualified for the finals for a 29th straight year, a streak not matched by any Australian or American professional sports team other than the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]]. Their seventh championship came the next season in 2015/16, as coach Gleeson became the first Wildcats coach to win multiple championships. With their eighth title coming in 2016/17, the Wildcats won back-to-back championships for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to consecutive championships. In 2017, four-time championship-winning trio Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage and [[Jesse Wagstaff]] equaled Ricky Grace's franchise record of winning four championships. In 2019, Martin and Wagstaff became the only players in NBL history to win five championships at the one club.<ref name=\"ninth1\" /><ref name=\"ninth2\" /> Martin and Wagstaff picked up their sixth championship rings in 2020, joining [[C. J. Bruton]] and [[David Stiff (basketball)|David Stiff]] as the NBL's only six-time champions and the only players to be able to do that at one club. Additionally, Gleeson attained his fifth NBL championship, making him the second-most successful coach in league history behind six-time winner [[Brian Goorjian]].<ref name=\"champions2020\" />\n\n===Finals appearance record===\nThe Perth Wildcats' run of 34 straight NBL finals appearances since 1987 is unmatched in major Australian professional sports. The most consecutive finals reached in [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]] football is 14 by the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] between 1982 and 1994, while the [[National Rugby League|NRL]]'s [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] made 23 consecutive finals appearances between 1951 and 1973.\n\nIt is matched in the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports]] only by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], which qualified for the playoffs for 34 consecutive years between 1972 and 2005. In [[sports in the United States|American sport]], the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] (as the Syracuse Nationals) made the [[NBA playoffs]] 22 straight seasons between 1949/50 and 1970/71, marking the best streak in the world's premier basketball league. In [[Major League Baseball]], the best streak is held by the [[Atlanta Braves]], who made 14 straight playoff appearances between 1992 and 2005. The only major professional team in the United States that had a record close to the Wildcats' 34 was the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]], who made 29 consecutive playoff appearances between 1967/68 and 1995/96.<ref name=equalB>{{cite web | url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/1g88mkt2vkntg1xkdv6vr35q25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223111357/http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/1g88mkt2vkntg1xkdv6vr35q25 | url-status=dead | archive-date=23 February 2015 | title=Perth Wildcats equal world record | work=Wildcats.com.au | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Wildcats' 34 still trails Israeli professional basketball club [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]]'s [[world record]] of 38 straight post-season appearances, with their 38th appearance coming in 2018/19<!--The Israeli League first had playoffs in 1981/82, and Maccabi Tel Aviv have made the playoffs every season.-->.<ref name=\"thirty-straight\"/>\n\n==Arena history==\n* [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]] (1982\u20131986)\n* [[HBF Stadium|Perth Superdrome / Challenge Stadium]] (1987\u20131989, 2002\u20132012)\n* [[Perth Entertainment Centre]] (1990\u20132002)\n* [[Crown Perth#Burswood Dome (demolished)|Burswood Dome]] (1994; 2004)\n* [[Perth Arena|RAC Arena]] (2012\u2013present)\n\n==Players==\n:See also: [http://www.wildcats.com.au/history/complete-player-list/ Perth Wildcats Complete Player List]\n\n===Current roster===\n<section begin=roster />{{Basketball roster nationality note}}\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n\n| team=Perth Wildcats}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 3 | nat = AUS | first = Nick | last = Kay | m = 2.06 | kgs = 106 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 8 | nat = AUS | first = Mitch | last = Norton | m = 1.86 | kgs = 91 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 9 | nat = AUS | first = Wani | last = Swaka Lo Buluk | m = 1.94 | kgs = 87 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 11 | nat = USA | first = Bryce | last = Cotton | m = 1.82 | kgs = 75 | note = I }}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 24 | nat = AUS | first = Jesse | last = Wagstaff | m = 2.03 | kgs = 103 }}\n{{player3 | pos = F/G | num = 35 | nat = AUS | first = Clint | last = Steindl | m = 2.00 | kgs = 91 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|[[Trevor Gleeson]]}}\n| asst_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Jacob Chance}}\n* {{player||AUS|Luke Brennan}}\n| str_cond = \n* {{player||AUS|Josh Cavanagh}}\n| DP = y\n| NS = y\n| I = y\n| roster_url = http://www.wildcats.com.au/stats#players-stats\n| accessdate = 26 March 2020\n}}<section end=roster />\n\n===Retired numbers===\n[[File:Perth Wildcats championship banners.jpg|thumb|right|The Wildcats' championship banners and retired numbers hanging at [[Perth Arena|RAC Arena]].|300x300px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:red; color:black;\"|'''Perth Wildcats retired numbers'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px; background:black; color:red;\"|No.\n! style=\"width:150px; background:black; color:red;\"|Player\n! style=\"width:40px; background:black; color:red;\"|Position\n! style=\"width:100px; background:black; color:red;\"|Tenure\n|-\n| '''6''' || [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]] || G || 1982\u20131992\n|-\n| '''7''' || [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] || F/C || 1987\u20131999\n|-\n| '''14''' <sup>1</sup> || [[Scott Fenton]] || G || 1988\u20131989\n|-\n| '''15''' || [[Ricky Grace]] || G || 1990\u20132005\n|-\n| '''21''' || [[Andrew Vlahov]] || F || 1991\u20132002\n|-\n| '''30''' || [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] || F || 1993\u20132002\n|}\n'''Notes:'''\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Scott Fenton]]'s No. 14 singlet was retired following his death in a car crash on 21 August 1989<ref>{{cite web|last=Donaldson|first=Mark|url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/joondalup-times/sport/perth-wildcats-mike-ellis-and-greg-hire-reflect-on-influence-of-scott-fentons-death/|title=Perth Wildcats: Mike Ellis and Greg Hire reflect on influence of Scott Fenton\u2019s death|work=CommunityNews.com.au|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===30th Anniversary All-Star Team===\nOn 4 February 2013, the Perth Wildcats announced their best team from the first three decades of the franchise at their 30th anniversary breakfast.

Australia. The Wildcats compete in the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]] (NBL) and play their home games at [[Perth Arena|RAC Arena]], known colloquially as \"The Jungle\". Their sister team, the [[Perth Lynx]], play in the [[Women's National Basketball League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/lf0tdqet5v611g8t08fvfd4ed |title=Introducing the Perth Lynx |work=Wildcats.com.au |date=16 April 2015 |accessdate=25 April 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419134247/http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/lf0tdqet5v611g8t08fvfd4ed |archivedate=19 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAfter three years of strong lobbying to the NBL, the creation of a national basketball team in Perth finally occurred in 1982. The '''Westate Wildcats''' were established and played out of the 800-seat [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. Interest in basketball steadily grew throughout the community and in 1984 the Westate Wildcats became the '''Perth Wildcats'''. The Wildcats have gone on to become the highest-drawing and most successful team in the league, having won NBL championships in [[1990 NBL season|1990]], [[1991 NBL season|1991]], [[1995 NBL season|1995]], [[1999\u20132000 NBL season|2000]], [[2009\u201310 NBL season|2010]], [[2013\u201314 NBL season|2014]], [[2015\u201316 NBL season|2016]], [[2016\u201317 NBL season|2017]], [[2018\u201319 NBL season|2019]] and [[2019\u201320 NBL season|2020]], placing the team five ahead of [[Melbourne United]], who has five championships. Since 1987, the Wildcats have made 34-straight post-season appearances, an accomplishment matched by no other professional sports team in Australia.\n\n==The Wildcats in Perth==\nThe Wildcats are the city's only major professional basketball team and are one of [[Western Australia]]'s major summer sport teams, along with the [[Perth Scorchers]] (cricket, [[Big Bash League]]), the [[Western Australia cricket team|Western Warriors]] (cricket, [[Sheffield Shield]]) and [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]] (soccer, [[A-League]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perthnow.com.au/sport/football/a-league/teams/perth/was-three-biggest-summer-sport-teams-sitting-atop-their-respective-competition-tables/news-story/ea4bf5390a3df8aa187652a8822ed5f3|title=WA's three biggest summer sport teams sitting atop their respective competition tables|work=PerthNow.com.au|date=18 November 2014|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> Wildcats players are active members of the Perth community, with the off-court structures aimed at making the players better people so that they could become better players cited as the biggest key to success. There are personal qualities demanded from owner [[Jack Bendat]] down through every rank of the organisation, and being a proactive part of community work, particularly through its InspiRED program, is pivotal. The public support for the Wildcats has been deemed remarkable, particularly the way fans have bought into the brand to create the \"Red Army\". The Wildcats' sturdy culture has long been built on a history of winning.<ref>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Steve|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/basketball/why-perth-wildcats-are-worlds-greatest-team-ng-ya-134739|title=Why Perth Wildcats are world's greatest team|work=TheWest.com.au|date=2 January 2016|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref> In 2009, after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Jack Bendat and then-chief executive officer Nick Marvin transformed the franchise, focusing on being family-friendly and engaging with children in Western Australia. From a zero-tolerance swearing policy to always making eye contact and acknowledging supporters, players have a 350-hour community engagement obligation, 200 hours above what the collective bargaining agreement requires. In 2009, instead of doing 20 school visits per year, the Wildcats started doing 100. This increased to 200 school visits in 2010, and the year after it rose again to 220. Under Marvin, the philosophy was: the more engaged the Wildcats were with the West Australian community, the more fans they accumulated. As a result, they are the most successful franchise in NBL history and one of the most competitive professional sporting teams in the world, with crowds at [[Perth Arena]] the best and unmatched in the NBL.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Clint|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-01/how-perth-wildcats-became-one-of-australias-greatest-sport-teams/10853814|title=How the Perth Wildcats became one of the most successful franchises in Australian sport|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=1 March 2016|accessdate=2 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Wildcats have consistently enjoyed large home crowds since moving into Perth Arena in 2012, resulting in arguably the greatest home-court advantage in the NBL.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/the-nbl-home-court-advantage/ |title=The NBL home court advantage |date=7 January 2016 |website=NBL.com.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> In January 2017, the Wildcats became the first NBL franchise to break the 10,000-member barrier.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/perth-wildcats/perth-wildcats-break-10000-member-barrier/ |title=Perth Wildats break 10,000 member barrier |date=18 January 2017 |website=Wildcats.com.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> As a result of their large fan base, known as the \"Red Army\", the Wildcats have set numerous record sell-out crowds at Perth Arena.

It took another three years of lobbying by the Perth basketball community, led by personalities like Gordon Ellis, before a team in Western Australia became a reality. Formed in 1982 as the '''Westate Wildcats''', the Wildcats became the first, and so far only, Western Australian team to compete in the NBL. The team was initially coached by Henry Daigle and captained by [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]], and they played out of [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]]. They struggled to make an impact in their first season, finishing 10th with a 10\u201316 win/loss record.\n\nGordon Ellis took over as coach in 1983, but a 6\u201316 record ensued, with the Wildcats finishing well out of the finals race in 13th position. In 1984, the team was renamed the '''Perth Wildcats''', but with coach Lynn Massey at the helm, the Wildcats finished on the bottom of the ladder (16th) with only three wins\u2014an all-time low for the team.\n\nA fourth coach in Jay Brehmer came into the team for the 1985 season. Brehmer and imports Dan Clausen and Roland Brooks looked to lead the Wildcats to a finals berth for the first time, but they narrowly missed out on the post-season with a 13\u201313 record and an eighth-place finish. The Wildcats suffered a major setback in 1986 with the loss of the high-scoring Roland Brooks, after he suffered a season-ending injury just 10 games into the season. Without their star import, the Wildcats struggled to be competitive as they finished the season in 12th place with an 8\u201318 record.\n\n===1987\u20132003: First Championship era===\n====1987: First trip to the finals====\nMany changes occurred in 1987. Most significantly, the team moved from the small confines of Perry Lakes Stadium to what was known in those days as the Perth Superdrome (now [[HBF Stadium]]). The Superdrome was capable of housing 5,000 people, compared to the 800-seat Perry Lakes Stadium. Also in 1987, still captained by Mike Ellis, the Perth Wildcats introduced players to the roster that would become household names such as [[Kendal Pinder]], [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]], [[Cal Bruton]] (player/coach), [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]], [[Eric Watterson]] and [[Trevor Torrance]].\n\nThe new talent paid off immediately for the Wildcats as the team made the finals for the first time. In the first two stages of the finals, the Wildcats defeated the [[Canberra Cannons]] and minor premier [[Adelaide 36ers]] to suddenly find themselves in the Grand Final series against the [[Brisbane Bullets]]. The Wildcats were repeatedly referred to as the 'Cinderella' story as they entered the season having finished in third-last position in 1986, only to go on to make the Grand Final after finishing the 1987 regular season in fourth position with a 19\u20137 record. The 'run, stun and have some fun' style of play<ref name=thirty-straight>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/perth-wildcats-30-and-counting/ |title=Perth Wildcats: 30 and counting |date=7 February 2016 |website=NBL.com.au |access-date=8 November 2016}}</ref> that had been implemented that season had worked wonders until the Grand Final series. The series was a promoter's dream: East Coast versus West; solid fundamentals versus \"run and gun\"; future Hall of Fame members on both sides on the floor; and two coaches who couldn't stand each other (Brian Kerle versus Cal Bruton).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.basketball.net.au/back-in-the-day-article-fifty-one/ |title=Back in the day article fifty-one |date=12 October 2010 |website=Basketball.net.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref> The Bullets defeated the Wildcats by just one point in front of a sell-out Perth crowd in Game 1 of the three-match series, before claiming the Championship in Brisbane in Game 2 a few days later.\n\n====1990: First Championship====\nAfter 1988 and 1989 both resulted in losses to the [[North Melbourne Giants]] in the Semi-finals, the most exciting chapter in Wildcats history came in 1990 as prominent West Australian businessman [[Kerry Stokes]] purchased the franchise and decided to raise the team's profile to incredible heights by moving the home court to the iconic 8,000-seat [[Perth Entertainment Centre]].\n\nAfter retiring as a player following the 1989 season, [[Cal Bruton]] became the Wildcats' general manager in 1990. Eager for the team to win its first NBL Championship, Bruton embarked on an active recruiting campaign during the off-season; a recruiting campaign that saw the introduction of a player that is regularly referred to as the Wildcats' greatest: [[Ricky Grace|Ricky 'Amazing' Grace]]. Grace teamed-up with Mike Ellis to create a dominating backcourt. The 1990 season began with turmoil as coach [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]] was controversially fired after only two games, and was replaced by Cal Bruton. Despite the shaky start to the season, the Wildcats recovered to finish in fifth place with a 17\u20139 record. Entering the finals as underdogs, the Wildcats swept the [[Melbourne Tigers]] in the Elimination Finals and got their revenge over the North Melbourne Giants with a 2\u20131 victory in the Semi-finals to again face the [[Brisbane Bullets]] in their second Grand Final appearance.\n\nTens of thousands of people across Western Australia tuned into the live coverage to watch the Wildcats triumph 112\u2013106 in Game 1 of the Grand Final series in front of a sold-out Perth Entertainment Centre. Brisbane tied the series at 1\u20131 after winning Game 2 in convincing fashion at home, 106\u201390. In the deciding game also in Brisbane a few days later, the Wildcats blew the game wide open in the third quarter and were up by 20 points before the final term. They cruised to a 109\u201386 victory to claim their first NBL Championship. For his superb series, Grace was recognised as [[NBL Grand Final Most Valuable Player Award|grand final MVP]]. Over the three games, Grace averaged 24.7 points per game.\n\n====1991: Back-to-back championships====\nIn controversial circumstances, Cal Bruton was not retained as coach despite leading the Wildcats to a championship in 1990. He was replaced by [[Murray Arnold]], a former assistant coach with the [[Chicago Bulls]]. Arnold's style of game was focused on defence which was a significant change from the high scoring and entertaining style previously implemented under Bruton. In pursuit of back-to-back championships, the Wildcats strengthened their roster considerably in the off-season with the addition of future WA basketball legend [[Andrew Vlahov]] and Peter Hansen, an American who arrived via Venezuela, Spain and the [[Perry Lakes Hawks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/basketball/when-the-wildcats-were-was-kings-ng-ya-324152|title=When the Wildcats were WA's kings|work=TheWest.com.au|date=29 March 2012|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nArnold's Wildcats were a highly successful team, as they finished the regular season as minor premiers with a 22\u20134 record. After another successful regular season, the Wildcats entered the finals brimming with confidence. The Wildcats easily accounted for long-term rivals the [[Adelaide 36ers]] in the Semi-finals to then find themselves against the highly-rated [[Eastside Spectres]] in the Grand Final. The Wildcats had a unique opportunity to win back-to-back titles, a feat only achieved by two other teams to that point in the history of the NBL. Everything looked on track when the Wildcats were able to defeat the Spectres in Game 1 in Melbourne by 26 points (109\u201383). Perth had hit fever pitch and another sold-out crowd awaited the Wildcats for Game 2 back at home. However, with their backs against the wall, the Spectres performed with a never-say-die attitude and upset the favourites at home by five points (86\u201381). Game 2 was played on a Friday night and Game 3 was scheduled for Sunday, leaving the Wildcats little time to formulate a new strategy. However, in front of an electric Perth crowd, the Wildcats were victorious in the deciding third game by 10 points (90\u201380) and became the third team in history to win back-to-back NBL Championships. Hansen was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 17.3 points per game over the three games.\n\nJust as Mike Ellis had hoped, he and the likes of Pinder, Crawford, Grace and Vlahov found themselves in the midst of a Perth Wildcats dynasty.\n\n====1993: Fourth Grand Final in seven years====\nAfter a down year in 1992 produced a quarter-final loss, three major personnel changes occurred heading into the 1993 season. Club legend and captain Mike Ellis retired after 12 seasons, Dr [[Adrian Hurley]] was appointed as the new head coach replacing Murray Arnold, and finally the Wildcats enticed two-time league MVP [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] to the team.\n\nWith new captain Andrew Vlahov at the helm, the Wildcats continued their on-court success to finish as minor premiers and make it through to another Grand Final series, this time against a [[Melbourne Tigers]] team led by [[Andrew Gaze]], [[Lanard Copeland]] and [[Mark Bradtke]]. The impending series is often described as the best Grand Final series in the history of the NBL. After splitting the first two games of the series, the championship came down to the final few seconds of Game 3 when Vlahov missed a three-point shot to tie the game with only seconds remaining.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_UGp_nR7bo|title=1993 NBL Grand Final|via=YouTube|date=4 August 2008|accessdate=1 March 2019}}</ref> Despite being on the losing team, Ricky Grace was named the MVP of the series after averaging 22.3 points per game over the three games.\n\n====1995: Third Championship====\n[[File:Perth Wildcats Champions 1995.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 1995 Championship-winning Wildcats]]\nFollowing a disappointing 1994 season, the Wildcats looked to recruit a pure sharp shooter to stretch opposing defenses and free up more room in the low post for the likes of Scott Fisher, James Crawford and Andrew Vlahov to operate in. [[Anthony Stewart (basketball)|Anthony Stewart]] was signed from the Hobart Tassie Devils to fill this role. Joining Stewart in the backcourt was Ricky Grace and [[Aaron Trahair]], while [[Martin Cattalini]] rounded out the eight-man rotation used by coach Adrian Hurley.\n\nThe Wildcats were highly successful in 1995, as coach Hurley guided the team to what was referred to as the 'Triple Crown'\u2014winning the pre-season competition, finishing minor premiers and then winning the NBL Championship. After defeating the Melbourne Tigers in the quarter-finals and the Adelaide 36ers in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats won through to their fifth Grand Final in nine years. In a rollercoaster Grand Final series against the [[North Melbourne Giants]], both teams won away contests to be level coming into the deciding Game 3. The Wildcats went on to overpower the Giants in Game 3 and recorded a comfortable 108\u201388 victory in claiming their third NBL title. Captain Andrew Vlahov was named MVP of the Grand Final series after averaging 24 points per game over the three games.\n\nThe Wildcats' championship win booked themselves a trip to London to play in the [[McDonald's Championship]], an international tournament featuring the best clubs in the world. The Wildcats lost to the [[Houston Rockets]] 116\u201372 in their first game of the tournament, but managed to defeat [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] 93\u201386 in their second game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Santamaria|first=Liam|url=http://www.nbl.com.au/featured-news/perth-wildcats-vs-houston-rockets-oral-history/|title=PERTH WILDCATS VS HOUSTON ROCKETS: AN ORAL HISTORY|work=NBL.com.au|date=15 August 2017|accessdate=15 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n====1999/2000: Fourth Championship====\nFollowing four straight injury-plagued seasons that all resulted in early finals exists, the Wildcats geared up for a big season in [[1999\u20132000 NBL season|1999/2000]] behind stalwarts Andrew Vlahov, Ricky Grace, Scott Fisher and Anthony Stewart, as well as the up-and-coming [[James Harvey (basketball)|James Harvey]] and two-year centre [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]]. In a boost for the Wildcats mid-season, the team signed import [[Marcus Timmons]] for their run to the finals.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.basketball.net.au/back-in-the-day-january-2000/ |title=Back in the day: January 2000 |date=12 January 2010 |website=Basketball.net.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the season, Perth Wildcats owner Kerry Stokes decided to pass on the reins of the franchise to basketball great [[Luc Longley]], fresh off being a three-time NBA championship winner with the [[Chicago Bulls]], and Andrew Vlahov. The new ownership duo proved to be an instant success with the Wildcats securing an unprecedented fourth championship, defeating the [[Victoria Titans]] in front of a capacity crowd of 8,000 at the Perth Entertainment Centre. The Wildcats swept the Grand Final series 2\u20130, winning Game 1 in Melbourne 84\u201378 before returning home to clinch the series with an 83\u201376 Game 2 win. After scoring a game-high 27 points in Game 2, Marcus Timmons was named MVP of the series. To top off the season, Paul Rogers became the first Wildcat to be honoured as the [[NBL Most Valuable Player Award|regular-season MVP]].\n\n====2002/03: Seventh Grand Final in 17 years====\nIn 2002, club legend and captain Andrew Vlahov retired after 12 seasons, leaving Ricky Grace as the only remaining Wildcat from the team's halcyon days of the early to mid 1990s. Following the closure of the Perth Entertainment Centre, the Wildcats moved back in to their old home, the Superdrome (now [[HBF Stadium]]), for the 2002/03 season. The Perth Entertainment Centre was a popular venue for the Wildcats thanks to its central CBD location. The Superdrome, or Challenge Stadium as it became known, was a suburban-based arena and could only hold 5,000 compared to the 8,000-seat Perth Entertainment Centre.\n\nFollowing Vlahov's retirement, Grace became captain of the Wildcats for the 2002/03 season. Behind Grace and coach Alan Black, the Wildcats finished second on the ladder with a 22\u20138 record and advanced through to their seventh Grand Final series where they faced the [[Sydney Kings]]. In the championship series, the Wildcats were outclassed by the Kings, as they lost Game 1 in Sydney 98\u201394 before returning home and losing 117\u2013101 in Game 2. In addition to Grace, Alan Black's son, [[Stephen Black]], was also an important member of the Wildcats' 2003 grand final team, as was [[Tony Ronaldson]], [[Rob Feaster]], [[Matthew Burston]], [[Brett Wheeler]] and James Harvey.\n\n===2003\u20132009: Championship drought===\n====2003\u20132005: Coaching changes and Ricky Grace's final years====\nIn the days following their grand final loss to the Kings, the Wildcats decided not to renew Black's contract and parted ways with him for a second time\u2014he was sensationally sacked in 1990 after just one season as coach before being brought back in 1998 to replace the outgoing Adrian Hurley; Black led the team for six straight seasons and claimed one championship.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-04-11/ellis-favoured-as-perth-sacks-black/1834640 | title = Ellis favoured as Perth sacks Black | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 11 April 2003 | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref> Club legend Mike Ellis was appointed head coach for the 2003/04 season, but in his lone season as coach of the Wildcats, Ellis guided the team to their first losing season since 1986, as they finished in seventh spot with a 15\u201318 record and earned a quarter-final defeat.

Grace retired as a four-time NBL champion and a 15-year member of the Wildcats.\n\n====2005\u20132009: Birth of 'The Scoring Machine'====\nWith Grace retired, the 2005/06 season saw veteran player Tony Ronaldson become captain of the Wildcats, while future club legend [[Shawn Redhage]] joined the team after a failed stint with the [[New Zealand Breakers]] in 2004. In his first season as a Wildcat, Redhage averaged a team-best 20 points per game and led the Wildcats to an unlikely Semi-final appearance, where they were defeated by the eventual champion [[Melbourne Tigers]]. Redhage's excellent debut season earned him runner-up in the MVP voting. During the 2005/06 season, in February 2006, West Australian businessman [[Jack Bendat]] became the chairman and majority shareholder of the franchise. Although no longer the majority shareholder, Andrew Vlahov remained in control of the team as managing director.<ref name=atf>{{cite web | url = http://andthefoul.net/NBLwiki/index.php?Perth%20Wildcats | title = Perth Wildcats \u2013 NBL Wiki | work = AndTheFoul.net | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = McLean | first = Stuart | url = http://www.racingandsports.com.au/en/sports/-story-79869 | title = Bendat takes interest in NBL Wildcats | work = RacingAndSports.com.au | date = 22 February 2006 | accessdate = 16 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, Paul Rogers became the fifth player to captain the Wildcats. Rogers replaced Tony Ronaldson as captain for the 2006/07 season, despite Ronaldson continuing to play for the team. The Wildcats celebrated their 25th anniversary during the 2006/07 season and recorded their highest number of wins in a single season (23 wins), although historically they have recorded better win-loss ratios. Their season came to an end after being defeated by the [[Cairns Taipans]] 82\u201378 in the quarter-finals.<ref name=\"atf\" /> For the second year in a row, Redhage led the Wildcats in scoring with 21.4 points per game.\n\nThe 2007/08 season saw the Wildcats return to the Semi-finals under coach Scott Fisher and captain Paul Rogers, but they again fell short of reaching the Grand Final, losing the best-of-three Semi-final series 2\u20131 to the [[Sydney Kings]]. On the season, Redhage averaged a career-best 22.9 points per game and set his career high for points in a game with 40 on 10 October 2007 against the [[Adelaide 36ers]].\n\nFollowing the 2007/08 season, head coach Scott Fisher departed the Wildcats in order to return to the United States for personal reasons, and was eventually replaced by his assistant, Connor Henry.<ref name=\"atf\" /> Another Quarter Final exist ensued for the Wildcats in 2008/09, leading to Henry's tenure lasting only one season.\n\nOver his first four seasons at the Wildcats, Redhage averaged at least 19 points and eight rebounds every year while earning a place in the [[All-NBL Team]] in four straight seasons. He was also a four-time Gordon Ellis Medalist during this time for being the Wildcats Club MVP and was donned the nickname of 'The Scoring Machine' due to his scoring prowess as a force on the interior.\n\n===2009\u2013present: Second Championship era===\n====2009/10: Fifth Championship====\nFollowing the 2008/09 season, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised a million dollars in sponsorship.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stack | first = Patrick | url = http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2009/05/16/2573781.htm | title = The Wildcats on Borrowed Time | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 16 May 2009 | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref> The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, there was a real possibility at the time that there would be no league in 2009/10.<ref>{{cite web | last = Stack | first = Patrick | url = http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/wa/content/2006/s2573634.htm | title = The Wildcats on Borrowed Time | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date = 15 May 2009 | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref> Collaborating with other clubs, the Wildcats helped reform the league.

One of [[Basketball Australia]]'s moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step with the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.botinagy.com/blog/the-new-nbl---what-it-means/ | title = The 'new NBL' \u2013 what it means | work = BotiNagy.com | accessdate = 28 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nBeveridge was instrumental in compiling a new-look team where Shawn Redhage, [[Stephen Weigh]] and [[Brad Robbins]] were surrounded by proven NBL players [[Damian Martin]], Drew Williamson, [[Luke Schenscher]] and [[Martin Cattalini]], and rising stars [[Kevin Lisch]] and [[Jesse Wagstaff]].

After claiming the minor premiership and beating the [[Gold Coast Blaze]] in the Semi-finals, the Wildcats came up against the [[Wollongong Hawks]] in their first Grand Final series since 2003. After Games 1 and 2 proved to be comfortable victories for each home team, the Wildcats found themselves down by as many as 11 points in the second quarter of Game 3, before Lisch exploded offensively to finish with 29 points in lifting the team to a record fifth NBL Championship with a 96\u201372 win.

Their recruiting was also put under the spotlight when they axed import Jaron Johnson in December for a second time. Johnson was first axed just three games into the season in order to bring in three-point specialist [[Andre Ingram]]. But when Ingram returned home after just a few days, citing mental issues, Johnson was reinstated.

When Redhage announced his retirement in January 2017, it would have taken a brave soul to predict his last act as a Wildcat would be cutting down the net at Perth Arena. At that time, the Wildcats were sitting on a shaky record of 12 wins and 12 losses and were sitting outside of the top-four. Missing the finals for the first time in 31 years seemed like a real possibility. However, an inspired Perth Wildcats side took to the court in February and finished the season on a seven-game streak. The run of form came at the perfect time, as the Wildcats surged towards the 2017 title, with Redhage's final game seeing him become a four-time championship player. In addition to his six club MVP awards, Redhage departed the NBL as one of the Wildcats' all-time great players. Redhage finished his illustrious NBL career with 393 games to his name\u2014380 with the Perth Wildcats (second on the team's all-time games-played list)\u2014while finishing with 5,819 points and 2,153 rebounds.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/perth-wildcats/redhage-retires-champion/ |title=Shawn Redhage retires a champion |date=7 March 2017 |website=Wildcats.com.au |access-date=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n====2017/18====\nThe Wildcats reacquired the services of Grand Final MVP [[Bryce Cotton]] for the [[2017\u201318 NBL season|2017/18 season]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Chris|url=https://thewest.com.au/sport/basketball/nbl-grand-final-mvp-bryce-cotton-in-line-for-shock-perth-wildcats-return-ng-b88536623z|title=NBL grand final MVP Bryce Cotton in line for shock Perth Wildcats return|work=TheWest.com.au|date=13 July 2017|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> but lost two-time Club MVP [[Casey Prather]] to [[Melbourne United]].

trophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 2016/17 championship trophy]]\nAfter three years of finals action that included a losing grand final series in 1987, the team won back-to-back titles in 1990 and 1991 behind the likes of [[Ricky Grace]], [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] and [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]], and coaches [[Cal Bruton]] and [[Murray Arnold]]. It took four more years for the team's third NBL title in 1995, with coach [[Adrian Hurley]] and captain [[Andrew Vlahov]] leading the way. Five more years elapsed before the next championship came in the 1999/2000 season. Behind coach [[Alan Black (basketball)|Alan Black]] and centre [[Paul Rogers (basketball)|Paul Rogers]], and veterans Vlahov, Grace and [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] still around, the Wildcats won their fourth title.\n\nA large championship drought occurred between 2000/01 and 2008/09, but the Wildcats still made the finals each season. Then in 2009/10, the Wildcats became the undisputed greatest NBL franchise with a fifth championship. Coach Rob Beveridge and import [[Kevin Lisch]] were instrumental to the team's success that season, as was [[Shawn Redhage]] and [[Damian Martin]].\n\nTheir sixth championship came in 2013/14 thanks to coach [[Trevor Gleeson]] and imports [[Jermaine Beal]] and [[James Ennis (basketball)|James Ennis]]. In 2014/15, the Wildcats qualified for the finals for a 29th straight year, a streak not matched by any Australian or American professional sports team other than the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]]. Their seventh championship came the next season in 2015/16, as coach Gleeson became the first Wildcats coach to win multiple championships. With their eighth title coming in 2016/17, the Wildcats won back-to-back championships for the first time since 1990/1991, while Gleeson became the first coach to guide the Wildcats to consecutive championships. In 2017, four-time championship-winning trio Damian Martin, Shawn Redhage and [[Jesse Wagstaff]] equaled Ricky Grace's franchise record of winning four championships. In 2019, Martin and Wagstaff became the only players in NBL history to win five championships at the one club.<ref name=\"ninth1\" /><ref name=\"ninth2\" /> Martin and Wagstaff picked up their sixth championship rings in 2020, joining [[C. J. Bruton]] and [[David Stiff (basketball)|David Stiff]] as the NBL's only six-time champions and the only players to be able to do that at one club. Additionally, Gleeson attained his fifth NBL championship, making him the second-most successful coach in league history behind six-time winner [[Brian Goorjian]].<ref name=\"champions2020\" />\n\n===Finals appearance record===\nThe Perth Wildcats' run of 34 straight NBL finals appearances since 1987 is unmatched in major Australian professional sports. The most consecutive finals reached in [[Australian Football League|VFL/AFL]] football is 14 by the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] between 1982 and 1994, while the [[National Rugby League|NRL]]'s [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] made 23 consecutive finals appearances between 1951 and 1973.\n\nIt is matched in the [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major North American sports]] only by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]], which qualified for the playoffs for 34 consecutive years between 1972 and 2005. In [[sports in the United States|American sport]], the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] (as the Syracuse Nationals) made the [[NBA playoffs]] 22 straight seasons between 1949/50 and 1970/71, marking the best streak in the world's premier basketball league. In [[Major League Baseball]], the best streak is held by the [[Atlanta Braves]], who made 14 straight playoff appearances between 1992 and 2005. The only major professional team in the United States that had a record close to the Wildcats' 34 was the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Boston Bruins]], who made 29 consecutive playoff appearances between 1967/68 and 1995/96.<ref name=equalB>{{cite web | url=http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/1g88mkt2vkntg1xkdv6vr35q25 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223111357/http://www.wildcats.com.au/article/id/1g88mkt2vkntg1xkdv6vr35q25 | url-status=dead | archive-date=23 February 2015 | title=Perth Wildcats equal world record | work=Wildcats.com.au | date=23 February 2015 | accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Wildcats' 34 still trails Israeli professional basketball club [[Maccabi Tel Aviv B.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]]'s [[world record]] of 38 straight post-season appearances, with their 38th appearance coming in 2018/19<!--The Israeli League first had playoffs in 1981/82, and Maccabi Tel Aviv have made the playoffs every season.-->.<ref name=\"thirty-straight\"/>\n\n==Arena history==\n* [[Perry Lakes Basketball Stadium]] (1982\u20131986)\n* [[HBF Stadium|Perth Superdrome / Challenge Stadium]] (1987\u20131989, 2002\u20132012)\n* [[Perth Entertainment Centre]] (1990\u20132002)\n* [[Crown Perth#Burswood Dome (demolished)|Burswood Dome]] (2004 \u2013 one game)\n* [[Perth Arena|RAC Arena]] (2012\u2013present)\n\n==Players==\n:See also: [http://www.wildcats.com.au/history/complete-player-list/ Perth Wildcats Complete Player List]\n\n===Current roster===\n<section begin=roster />{{Basketball roster nationality note}}\n{{Basketball roster header|type=NBL|age=n\n| team=Perth Wildcats}}\n<!-- list of players -->\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 3 | nat = AUS | first = Nick | last = Kay | m = 2.06 | kgs = 106 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 8 | nat = AUS | first = Mitch | last = Norton | m = 1.86 | kgs = 91 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G/F | num = 9 | nat = AUS | first = Wani | last = Swaka Lo Buluk | m = 1.94 | kgs = 87 }}\n{{player3 | pos = G | num = 11 | nat = USA | first = Bryce | last = Cotton | m = 1.82 | kgs = 75 | note = I }}\n{{player3 | pos = F | num = 24 | nat = AUS | first = Jesse | last = Wagstaff | m = 2.03 | kgs = 103 }}\n{{player3 | pos = F/G | num = 35 | nat = AUS | first = Clint | last = Steindl | m = 2.00 | kgs = 91 }}\n<!-- end list of players -->\n{{Basketball roster footer\n| head_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|[[Trevor Gleeson]]}}\n| asst_coach = \n* {{player||AUS|Jacob Chance}}\n* {{player||AUS|Luke Brennan}}\n| str_cond = \n* {{player||AUS|Josh Cavanagh}}\n| DP = y\n| NS = y\n| I = y\n| roster_url = http://www.wildcats.com.au/stats#players-stats\n| accessdate = 26 March 2020\n}}<section end=roster />\n\n===Retired numbers===\n[[File:Perth Wildcats championship banners.jpg|thumb|right|The Wildcats' championship banners and retired numbers hanging at [[Perth Arena|RAC Arena]].|300x300px]]\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:red; color:black;\"|'''Perth Wildcats retired numbers'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px; background:black; color:red;\"|No.\n! style=\"width:150px; background:black; color:red;\"|Player\n! style=\"width:40px; background:black; color:red;\"|Position\n! style=\"width:100px; background:black; color:red;\"|Tenure\n|-\n| '''6''' || [[Mike Ellis (basketball)|Mike Ellis]] || G || 1982\u20131992\n|-\n| '''7''' || [[James Crawford (basketball)|James Crawford]] || F/C || 1987\u20131999\n|-\n| '''14''' <sup>1</sup> || [[Scott Fenton]] || G || 1988\u20131989\n|-\n| '''15''' || [[Ricky Grace]] || G || 1990\u20132005\n|-\n| '''21''' || [[Andrew Vlahov]] || F || 1991\u20132002\n|-\n| '''30''' || [[Scott Fisher (basketball)|Scott Fisher]] || F || 1993\u20132002\n|}\n'''Notes:'''\n* <sup>1</sup> [[Scott Fenton]]'s No. 14 singlet was retired following his death in a car crash on 21 August 1989<ref>{{cite web|last=Donaldson|first=Mark|url=http://www.communitynews.com.au/joondalup-times/sport/perth-wildcats-mike-ellis-and-greg-hire-reflect-on-influence-of-scott-fentons-death/|title=Perth Wildcats: Mike Ellis and Greg Hire reflect on influence of Scott Fenton\u2019s death|work=CommunityNews.com.au|date=29 November 2012|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===30th Anniversary All-Star Team===\nOn 4 February 2013, the Perth Wildcats announced their best team from the first three decades of the franchise at their 30th anniversary breakfast.
