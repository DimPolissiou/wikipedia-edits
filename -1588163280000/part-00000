While the [[infidel]] jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames.

Houris are explicitly described as \"untouched by human and jinn\" indicates, that jinn could enter Jannah, too. Others however, deny the possibility for jinn to enter Jannah, they could merely try to avoid [[hell]]. Accordingly, in the afterlife the fires of hell will be brought forth to the jinn. While the [[infidel]] jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames.  Other traditions explain, in more detail, the nature of jinn in paradise, such as inverting the invisibility of jinn, thus the jinn will turn into fixed forms, while they can not see humans anymore.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 97-99 (German)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Abu Hanifa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madhhab|schools jurisprudence]] of [[Sunnism]], the jinn might enter jannah, but, just like angels, they will receive no reward.

It was written after Springsteen saw Presley perform at a May 28, 1977 concert at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in Philadelphia. Springsteen said, \"I sent [Elvis] a demo of it but he died before it arrived.\"<ref>Clinton Heylin. ''E-Street Shuffle: The Glory Days of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band.''

Springsteen finally scored his own inaugural top 10 hit in 1980 with \"[[Hungry Heart]]\" which was his first single release subsequent to the Pointer Sisters' success with \"Fire\" (Springsteen had in fact written \"Hungry Heart\" for [[the Ramones]] but was persuaded by his manager/producer [[Jon Landau]] that the song was the ideal vehicle to break Springsteen as a major singles artist).<ref>Marc Dolan.

Springsteen finally scored his own inaugural top 10 hit in 1980 with \"[[Hungry Heart]]\" which was his first single release subsequent to the Pointer Sisters' success with \"Fire\" (Springsteen had in fact written \"Hungry Heart\" for [[the Ramones]] but was persuaded by his manager/producer [[Jon Landau]] that the song was the ideal vehicle to break Springsteen as a major singles artist).<ref>Marc Dolan.

It stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Frederic Forrest]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Dennis Hopper]]. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and [[John Milius]] and narration written by [[Michael Herr]], was loosely based on the 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. The setting was changed from late 19th-century [[Congo Free State|Congo]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. The film follows a river journey from [[South Vietnam]] into [[Cambodia]] undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (a character based on Conrad's [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]] and played by Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate [[Colonel Kurtz]] (Brando, with the character being based on Conrad's [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]]), a renegade [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\n\nMilius became interested in adapting ''Heart of Darkness'' for a Vietnam War setting, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and [[George Lucas]] as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directoral control, and was influenced by [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) in his approach to the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary |last=Peary |first=Gerald |publisher=Gerald Peary |accessdate=March 14, 2007}}</ref> Initially set to be a five-month shoot, the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year, as chronicled in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (1991).

The film performed well at the box office, grossing $78 million domestically and going on to gross over $150 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed; while [[Vittorio Storaro]]'s cinematography was widely acclaimed, several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing.

Kurtz]] has apparently gone insane and is waging a brutal but successful guerilla war against terrified [[People's_Army_of_Vietnam#Vietnam_War|NVA]] and [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam|PLAF]] forces without permission, directions or resupply from his commanders. At an outpost in [[Cambodia]], he commands American and [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops who see him as a [[demigod]]. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to [[I Field Force, Vietnam|I Field Force]] headquarters in Nha Trang, briefed on the situation by two Army commanders and a CIA officer, and ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with [[Summary execution|extreme prejudice]]\". Willard, initially ambivalent, joins a U.S. Navy [[Patrol Boat, River|river patrol boat]] (PBR) commanded by [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] \"Chief\" Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\", and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)#Vietnam War|1st Squadron]], [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's [[Viet Cong]]-held coastal mouth. The squadron raids at dawn, with Kilgore ordering a [[napalm]] strike on the Viet Cong. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly-conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\n\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice he made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join the Special Forces, which afforded no prospect of advancing in rank past Colonel. The third-generation West Point graduate could have pursued more conventional command assignments to eventually rise to four-star general. \n\nWeeks later, the PBR reaches the remote U.S. Army outpost by the Do Lung Bridge. Willard and Lance enter the outpost after nightfall, seeking information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer at Do Lung, Willard orders the Chief to continue as an unseen enemy assaults the bridge. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.{{efn|A few days before Willard received this dispatch, Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard's mission, he (Chief) had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge. Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head.}}\n\nAs the crew read letters from home, Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting the attention of an unseen enemy, and Mr. Clean is killed. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by impaling him on the spear point protruding from his own chest. Willard suffocates Chief and Lance buries him in the river. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR, but despite Chef's anger about the mission, he rejects Willard's offer to cut the sailors loose and continue alone and insists that they complete the mission together.\n\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, located on the site of a long abandoned [[Angkor Empire]] temple compound, teeming with Montagnards and strewn with corpses and severed heads. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American freelance photojournalist, who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they wander through, they come across a near-catatonic Colby, along with other US servicemen now in Kurtz's renegade army. Willard returns to the moored PBR to leave Chef with the boat, ordering him to call in a pre-arranged airstrike on the outpost if Willard and Lance do not return.\n\nIn the camp, Willard is subdued, bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple. Willard is detained and tortured for several days, during which time Kurtz kills Chef, preventing the airstrike from occurring. Willard is soon released and allowed to roam the compound. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, the [[human condition]] and civilization, while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of his adversaries, the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\n\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a [[water buffalo]], Willard stealthily enters Kurtz's chamber as he is making a voice recording and attacks him with a machete. Mortally wounded, Kurtz utters \"...{{nbsp}}The horror ... the horror {{nbsp}}...\" and dies. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard then leads Lance to the boat and they sail away. Kurtz's final words echo eerily as everything [[Fade (lighting)|fades to black]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{About||a list of the rest of the cast members not included in the 153-minute version of the film that was released in theaters|Apocalypse Now Redux#Cast}}\n[[File:Marlon Brando (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The performance of [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] was critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chas |last=Gerretsen|author-link=Chas Gerretsen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/the-horror-apocalypse-now-unseen-in-pictures |title=The horror!

The novella, based on Conrad's experience as a steamboat captain in Africa, is set in the [[Congo Free State]] during the 19th century.<ref>Murfin, Ross C (ed.) (1989): ''Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness. A Case Study in Contemporary Criticism''. Boston: St. Martin's Press, pp. 3\u201316.</ref> Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Capt. Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers.\n\nAfter arriving at Kurtz's outpost, Marlow concludes that Kurtz has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: \"the heart of an immense darkness\".\n\nIn the novella, Marlow is the pilot of a river boat sent to collect ivory from Kurtz's outpost, only gradually becoming infatuated with Kurtz. In fact, when he discovers Kurtz in terrible health, Marlow makes an effort to bring him home safely. In the film, Willard is an assassin dispatched to kill Kurtz. Nevertheless, the depiction of Kurtz as a god-like leader of a tribe of natives and his malarial fever, Kurtz's written exclamation \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (which appears in the film as \"Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all!\") and his last words \"The horror! The horror!\" are taken from Conrad's novella.\n\nCoppola argues that many episodes in the film\u2014the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example\u2014respect the spirit of the novella and in particular its critique of the concepts of civilization and progress. Other episodes adapted by Coppola, the  Playboy Playmates' (Sirens) exit, the lost souls, \"take me home\" attempting to reach the boat and Kurtz's tribe of (white-faced) natives parting the canoes (gates of Hell) for Willard, (with Chef and Lance) to enter the camp are likened to Virgil and \"The Inferno\" ([[Divine Comedy]]) by [[Dante]]. While Coppola replaced European [[colonialism]] with American [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], the message of Conrad's book is still clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |title=Heart of Darkness & Apocalypse Now: A comparative analysis of novella and film |publisher=Cyberpat.com |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is often speculated that Coppola's interpretation of the [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] character was modeled after [[Tony Poe]], a highly decorated Vietnam-era paramilitary officer from the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].<ref>Leary, William L. \"Death of a Legend\". Air America Archive. Retrieved June 10, 2007.</ref> Poe's actions in Vietnam and in the \"Secret War\" in neighboring Laos, in particular his highly unorthodox and often savage methods of waging war, show many similarities to those of the fictional Kurtz; for example, Poe was known to drop severed heads from helicopters into enemy-controlled villages as a form of [[psychological warfare]] and use human ears to record the number of enemies his indigenous troops had killed. He would send these ears back to his superiors as proof of the efficacy of his operations deep inside Laos.<ref>Warner, Roger. Shooting at the Moon.</ref><ref>Ehrlich, Richard S.

Eliot's poetry ===\nIn the film, shortly before Colonel Kurtz dies, he recites part of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem \"[[The Hollow Men]]\". The poem is preceded in printed editions by the epigraph \"Mistah Kurtz&nbsp;\u2013 he dead\", a quotation from Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''.\n\nTwo books seen opened on Kurtz's desk in the film are ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]'' by [[Jessie Weston]] and ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[Sir James Frazer]], the two books that Eliot cited as the chief sources and inspiration for his poem \"[[The Waste Land]]\". Eliot's original epigraph for \"The Waste Land\" was this passage from ''Heart of Darkness'', which ends with Kurtz's final words:<ref>Davidson, Harriet. \"Improper desire: reading ''The Waste Land''\" in Anthony David Moody (ed.).

By that time, the film was already so over-budget, even he worried funding would be halted if word about his condition were to reach the investors, and claimed he suffered heat stroke instead. He was back on the set on April 19, and during the interim, his brother [[Joe Estevez]] filled in for him and provided voice overs needed for his character.

Rumors began to circulate that ''Apocalypse Now'' had several endings but Richard Beggs, who worked on the sound elements, said, \"There were never ''five'' endings, but just the one, even if there were differently ''edited'' versions\". These rumors came from Coppola departing frequently from the original screenplay. Coppola admitted that he had no ending because Brando was too fat to play the scenes as written in the original script{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. With the help of Dennis Jakob, Coppola decided that the ending could be \"the classic myth of the murderer who gets up the river, kills the king, and then himself becomes the king&nbsp;\u2013 it's the [[Fisher King]], from ''The Golden Bough''\".<ref name=\"Cowie6\">Cowie 1990, p. 125.</ref>\n\nA [[Domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] was slaughtered with a machete for the climactic scene.

The sound material brought back from the Philippines was inadequate, because the small location crew lacked the time and resources to record jungle sounds and ambient noises. Murch and his crew fabricated the mood of the jungle on the soundtrack. ''Apocalypse Now'' had novel sound techniques for a movie, as Murch insisted on recording the most up-to-date gunfire and employed the [[Dolby Stereo 70&nbsp;mm Six Track]] system for the 70&nbsp;mm release. This used two channels of sound from behind the audience as well as three channels of sound from behind the movie screen.<ref name=\"Cowie9\" /> The 35&nbsp;mm release used the new [[Dolby Stereo]] optical stereo system, but due to the limitations of the technology at the time, this 35&nbsp;mm release that played in the majority of theaters did not include any surround sound.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Eric Dienstfrey |title=The Myth of the Speakers: A Critical Reexamination of Dolby History |journal=Film History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=167\u2013193 |publisher=Film HIstory: An International Journal |jstor=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06|year=2016 |doi=10.2979/filmhistory.28.1.06 }}</ref>\n\nIn May 1978, Coppola postponed the opening until spring of 1979 and screened a \"work in progress\" for 900 people in April 1979 that was not well received.<ref name=\"Cowie10\">Cowie 1990, p. 128.</ref> That same year, he was invited to screen ''Apocalypse Now'' at the [[1979 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Cowie11\">Cowie 1990, p. 129.</ref> United Artists were not keen on showing an unfinished version in front of so many members of the press. Since his 1974 film ''[[The Conversation]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]], Coppola agreed to screen ''Apocalypse Now'' with only a month before the festival. The week prior to Cannes, Coppola arranged three sneak previews of slightly different versions, with running times of 150 minutes, 165 minutes, and a 139-minute cut in Los Angeles on May 11.<ref name=var/> He allowed critics to attend the screenings and believed that they would honor the embargo placed on reviews. On 14 May, [[Rona Barrett]] reviewed the film on television and called it \"a disappointing failure\".<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> At Cannes, Zoetrope technicians worked during the night before the screening to install additional speakers on the theater walls, to achieve Murch's [[5.1 Surround Sound|5.1]] soundtrack.<ref name=\"Cowie11\" /> On August 15, 1979 ''Apocalypse Now'' was released in the U.S. in only 15 theaters equipped to play the Dolby Stereo 70 mm prints with stereo [[surround sound]].<ref>Dienstfrey 2016, p. 171</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\n\n=== Alternative and varied endings ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nAt the time of its release, discussion and rumors circulated about the supposed various endings for ''Apocalypse Now''. Coppola said the original ending was written in haste, where Kurtz convinced Willard to join forces and together they repelled the air strike on the compound. Coppola said he never fully agreed with the Kurtz and Willard dying in fatalistic explosive intensity, preferring to end the film in a more encouraging manner.\n\nWhen Coppola originally organized the ending, he considered two significantly different ends to the movie. One involved Willard leading Lance by the hand as everyone in Kurtz's base throws down their weapons, and ends with images of Willard piloting the PBR slowly away from Kurtz's compound, this final scene superimposed over the face of a stone idol, which then fades into black. The other option showed an air strike being called and the base being blown to bits in a spectacular display, consequently killing everyone left within it.\n\nThe original 1979 {{nowrap|70mm}} exclusive theatrical release ended with Willard's boat, the stone statue, then fade to black with no credits, save for '\"Copyright 1979 Omni Zoetrope\"' right after the film ends. This mirrors the lack of any opening titles and supposedly stems from Coppola's original intention to \"tour\" the film as one would a play: the credits would have appeared on printed programs provided before the screening began.<ref name=\"Cowie14\">Cowie 1990, p. 132.</ref>\n\nThere have been, to date, many variations of the end credit sequence, beginning with the 35&nbsp;mm general release version, where Coppola elected to show the credits superimposed over shots of the jungle exploding into flames.<ref name=\"Cowie14\" /> Rental prints circulated with this ending, and can be found in the hands of a few collectors. Some versions of this had the subtitle \"A United Artists release\", while others had \"An Omni Zoetrope release\". The network television version of the credits ended with \"...{{nbsp}}from MGM/UA Entertainment Company\" (the film made its network debut shortly after the merger of [[MGM]] and UA). One variation of the end credits can be seen on both YouTube and as a supplement on the current [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] Blu-ray.\n\nLater when Coppola heard that audiences interpreted this as an air strike called by Willard, Coppola pulled the film from its {{nowrap|35 mm}} run and put credits on a black screen. However, the \"air strike\" footage continued to circulate in repertory theaters well into the 1980s, and it was included in the 1980s LaserDisc release. In the DVD commentary, Coppola explains that the images of explosions had not been intended to be part of the story; they were intended to be seen as completely separate from the film. He had added the explosions to the credits as a graphic background to the credits.<ref>Destruction of the Kurtz Compound w/ commentary by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'' DVD extras. November 20, 2001.</ref>\n\nCoppola explained he had captured the now-iconic footage during demolition of the sets (set destruction and removal was required by the Philippine government). Coppola filmed the demolition with multiple cameras fitted with different film stocks and lenses to capture the explosions at different speeds. He wanted to do something with the dramatic footage and decided to add them to the credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreview1/a/apocalypsenowra.htm |title=DVD Review Apocalypse Now \u2013 Apocalypse Now DVD Review |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' ===\n{{Main|Apocalypse Now Redux}}\nIn 2001, Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' in cinemas and subsequently on DVD. This is an extended version that restores 49 minutes of scenes cut from the original film. Coppola has continued to circulate the original version as well: the two versions are packaged together in the ''Complete Dossier'' DVD, released on August 15, 2006 and in the Blu-ray edition released on October 19, 2010.\n\nThe longest section of added footage in the ''Redux'' version is the \"French Plantation\" sequence, a chapter involving the de Marais family's rubber plantation, a holdover from the colonization of [[French Indochina]], featuring Coppola's two sons [[Gian-Carlo Coppola|Gian-Carlo]] and [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] as children of the family. Around the dinner table, a young French child recites a poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]] entitled ''[[L'albatros (poem)|L'albatros]]''. The French family patriarch is not satisfied with the child's recitation. The child is sent away. These scenes were removed from the 1979 cut, which premiered at [[Festival de Cannes|Cannes]]. In behind-the-scenes footage in ''Hearts of Darkness'', Coppola expresses his anger, on the set, at the technical limitations of the scenes, the result of shortage of money. At the time of the ''Redux'' version, it was possible to digitally enhance the footage to accomplish Coppola's vision. In the scenes, the French family patriarchs argue about the positive side of colonialism in Indochina and denounce the betrayal of the military men in the [[First Indochina War]]. Hubert de Marais argues that French politicians sacrificed entire battalions at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], and tells Willard that the US created the Viet Cong (as the [[Viet Minh]]) to fend off Japanese invaders.\n\nOther added material includes extra combat footage before Willard meets Kilgore, a humorous scene in which Willard's team steals Kilgore's surfboard (which sheds some light on the hunt for the mangoes), a follow-up scene to the dance of the ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates, in which Willard's team finds the Playmates stranded after their helicopter has run out of fuel (trading two barrels of fuel for two hours with the Bunnies), and a scene of Kurtz reading from a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about the war, surrounded by Cambodian children.\n\nA deleted scene titled \"Monkey Sampan\" shows Willard and the PBR crew suspiciously eyeing an approaching [[sampan]] juxtaposed to Montagnard villagers joyfully singing \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. As the sampan gets closer, Willard realizes there are monkeys on it and no helmsman. Finally, just as the two boats pass, the wind turns the sail and exposes a naked dead [[Viet Cong]] (VC) nailed to the sail boom. His body is mutilated and looks as though the man had been [[flogged]] and [[castrated]]. The singing stops. As they pass on by, Chief notes out loud, \"That's comin' from where we goin', Captain.\" The boat then slowly passes the giant tail of a shot down [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bomber]] as the noise of engines high in the sky is heard. Coppola said that he made up for cutting this scene by having the PBR pass under an aircraft tail in the final cut.\n\n=== First Assembly ===\nA 289-minute First Assembly circulates as a video bootleg, containing extra material not included in either the original theatrical release or the \"redux\" version.<ref name=\"Coates\">{{cite news |last=Coates |first=Gordon |title=Coppola's slow boat on the Nung |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 17, 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/oct/17/1 |accessdate=October 17, 2008 |location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081018214153/http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2008/oct/17/1|archive-date=October 18, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' ===\nIn April 2019, Coppola showed ''Apocalypse Now Final Cut'' for the 40th anniversary screening at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Gordon |title=Tribeca: Danny Boyle's Beatles Movie 'Yesterday' Set as Closing Night Film |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/news/beatles-movie-yesterday-say-anything-apocalypse-now-set-tribeca-2019-1194756|access-date=April 24, 2019 |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 14, 2019}}</ref> This new version is Coppola's preferred version of the film and has a runtime of three hours and three minutes, with Coppola having cut 20 minutes of the added material from ''Redux''; the scenes deleted include the second encounter with the Playmates, parts of the plantation sequence, and Kurtz's reading of ''Time'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=442569 |title=\t\nApocalypse Now Comparison: Final Cut - Redux Version |website=Movie Censorship |date=September 15, 2019 |accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref> It is also the first time the film has been restored from the original camera negative at 4K; previous transfers were made from an [[interpositive]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=O'Falt |first1=Chris |title='Apocalypse Now': 5 Things You Need to Know About Coppola's New 'Final Cut' |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/04/apocalypse-now-final-cut-5-things-to-know-francis-for-coppola-new-version-1202129340/ |website=IndieWire|access-date=April 30, 2019}}</ref> It was released in autumn 2019, along with an extended cut of ''[[The Cotton Club (film)|The Cotton Club]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming Jr. |first1=Mike |title=Francis Ford Coppola: How Winning Cannes 40 Years Ago Saved 'Apocalypse Now,' Making 'Megalopolis,' Why Scorsese Almost Helmed 'Godfather Part II' & Re-Cutting Three Past Films |url=https://deadline.com/2019/05/francis-ford-coppola-apocalypse-now-cannes-40-anniversary-megalopolis-scorsese-godfather-part-ii-re-cutting-godfather-iii-cotton-club-interview-1202613659/ |date=May 13, 2019 |website=Deadline|access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref> It also had a release in select [[IMAX]] theaters on August 15 and 18, 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://collider.com/apocalypse-now-final-cut-imax-theaters/ |title=Restored 'Apocalypse Now Final Cut' Coming to IMAX Theaters for the 40th Anniversary |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 25, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Cannes screening ===\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|The [[1979 Cannes Film Festival]] Palme d'Or was awarded to ''Apocalypse Now''.]]\nA three-hour version of ''Apocalypse Now'' was screened as a \"work in progress\" at the 1979 Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, May 19, 1979<ref name=var>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 23, 1979|title=An Archival Detailing Of UA's 'Apocalypse Now' Since 1967 Start|last=Pollock|first=Dale|page=5}}</ref> and met with prolonged applause.<ref name=\"Cowie12\">Cowie 1990, p. 130.</ref> At the subsequent press conference, Coppola criticized the media for attacking him and the production during their problems filming in the Philippines and said, \"We had access to too much money, too much equipment, and little by little we went insane\", and \"My film is not about Vietnam, it ''is'' Vietnam\".<ref name=\"Cowie12\" /> The filmmaker upset newspaper critic [[Rex Reed]] who reportedly stormed out of the conference.

The first [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] appearance, on [[Laserdisc]] on December 29, 1991, cropped the film to a 2:1 aspect ratio (conforming to the [[Univisium]] spec created by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), and included a small degree of pan-and-scan processing at the insistence of Coppola and Storaro.

All DVD releases have maintained this aspect ratio in anamorphic widescreen, but present the film without the end credits, which were treated as a separate feature.

It stars [[Marlon Brando]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Frederic Forrest]], [[Albert Hall (actor)|Albert Hall]], [[Sam Bottoms]], [[Laurence Fishburne]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Dennis Hopper]]. The screenplay, co-written by Coppola and [[John Milius]] and narration written by [[Michael Herr]], was loosely based on the 1899 novella ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' by [[Joseph Conrad]]. The setting was changed from late 19th-century [[Congo Free State|Congo]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. The film follows a river journey from [[South Vietnam]] into [[Cambodia]] undertaken by Captain Benjamin L. Willard (a character based on Conrad's [[Charles Marlow|Marlow]] and played by Sheen), who is on a secret mission to assassinate [[Colonel Kurtz]] (Brando, with the character being based on Conrad's [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]]), a renegade [[United States Army Special Forces|Army Special Forces]] officer accused of murder and who is presumed insane.\n\nMilius became interested in adapting ''Heart of Darkness'' for a Vietnam War setting, and initially began developing the film with Coppola as producer and [[George Lucas]] as director. After Lucas became unavailable, Coppola took over directoral control, and was influenced by [[Werner Herzog]]'s ''[[Aguirre, the Wrath of God]]'' (1972) in his approach to the material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldpeary.com/interviews/abc/coppola.html |title=Francis Ford Coppola, Interview with Gerald Peary |last=Peary |first=Gerald |publisher=Gerald Peary |accessdate=March 14, 2007}}</ref> Initially set to be a five-month shoot, the film became noted for the problems encountered while making it for over a year, as chronicled in the documentary ''[[Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse]]'' (1991).

The film performed well at the box office, grossing $78 million domestically and going on to gross over $150 million worldwide. Initial reviews were mixed; while [[Vittorio Storaro]]'s cinematography was widely acclaimed, several critics found Coppola's handling of the story's major themes to be anticlimactic and intellectually disappointing. ''Apocalypse Now'' is today considered to be [[List of films considered the best|one of the greatest films ever made]]. It was nominated for eight [[Academy Awards]] at the [[52nd Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] (Coppola), and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Duvall, and went on to win for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound]].

Kurtz]] has apparently gone insane and is waging a brutal but successful guerilla war against terrified [[People's_Army_of_Vietnam#Vietnam_War|NVA]] and [[People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam|PLAF]] forces without permission, directions or resupply from his commanders. At an outpost in [[Cambodia]], he commands American and [[Degar|Montagnard]] troops who see him as a [[demigod]]. Captain Benjamin L. Willard is summoned to [[I Field Force, Vietnam|I Field Force]] headquarters in Nha Trang, briefed on the situation by two Army commanders and a CIA officer, and ordered to \"terminate Kurtz's command... with [[Summary execution|extreme prejudice]]\". Willard, initially ambivalent, joins a U.S. Navy [[Patrol Boat, River|river patrol boat]] (PBR) commanded by [[Chief petty officer (United States)|Chief Petty Officer]] \"Chief\" Phillips, with crewmen Lance, \"Chef\", and \"Mr. Clean\" to quietly navigate up the N\u00f9ng River to Kurtz's outpost. Before reaching the coastal mouth of the N\u00f9ng, they rendezvous with the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)#Vietnam War|1st Squadron]], [[9th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|9th Cavalry Regiment]], a helicopter-borne air assault unit commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, to discuss safe passage. Kilgore is initially uncooperative as he has not received word about their mission through normal channels, but he becomes more engaged after discovering that Lance is a well-known surfer. The commander is an avid surfer himself and agrees to escort them through the N\u00f9ng's [[Viet Cong]]-held coastal mouth. The squadron raids at dawn, with Kilgore ordering a [[napalm]] strike on the Viet Cong. Before Kilgore can lure Lance out to surf on the newly-conquered beach, Willard gathers the sailors to the PBR to continue their mission.\n\nTension arises as Willard believes himself in command of the PBR while Chief prioritizes routine patrol objectives over Willard's. Slowly making their way upriver, Willard partially reveals his mission to the Chief to assuage his concerns about why his mission should proceed. As Willard studies Kurtz's dossier, he is struck by the mid-career sacrifice he made by leaving a prestigious Pentagon assignment to join the Special Forces, which afforded no prospect of advancing in rank past Colonel. The third-generation West Point graduate could have pursued more conventional command assignments to eventually rise to four-star general. \n\nWeeks later, the PBR reaches the remote U.S. Army outpost by the Do Lung Bridge. Willard and Lance enter the outpost after nightfall, seeking information on what is upriver and receive a dispatch bag containing official and personal mail. Unable to find any commanding officer at Do Lung, Willard orders the Chief to continue as an unseen enemy assaults the bridge. Willard learns via the dispatch that another MACV-SOG operative, Special Forces Captain Richard Colby, was sent on an earlier mission identical to Willard's and has since joined Kurtz.{{efn|A few days before Willard received this dispatch, Chief had told him that about six months prior to Willard's mission, he (Chief) had taken another man north of the Do Long Bridge. Chief had heard this man shot himself in the head.}}\n\nAs the crew read letters from home, Lance activates a smoke grenade while under the influence of LSD, attracting the attention of an unseen enemy, and Mr. Clean is killed. Further upriver, Chief is impaled by a spear thrown by Montagnards and attempts to kill Willard by impaling him on the spear point protruding from his own chest. Willard suffocates Chief and Lance buries him in the river. Willard reveals his mission to Chef, who is now in charge of the PBR, but despite Chef's anger about the mission, he rejects Willard's offer to cut the sailors loose and continue alone and insists that they complete the mission together.\n\nThe PBR arrives at Kurtz's outpost, located on the site of a long abandoned [[Angkor Empire]] temple compound, teeming with Montagnards and strewn with corpses and severed heads. Willard, Chef and Lance are greeted by an American freelance photojournalist, who manically praises Kurtz's genius. As they wander through, they come across a near-catatonic Colby, along with other US servicemen now in Kurtz's renegade army. Willard returns to the moored PBR to leave Chef with the boat, ordering him to call in a pre-arranged airstrike on the outpost if Willard and Lance do not return.\n\nIn the camp, Willard is subdued, bound and brought before Kurtz in a darkened temple. Willard is detained and tortured for several days, during which time Kurtz kills Chef, preventing the airstrike from occurring. Willard is soon released and allowed to roam the compound. Kurtz lectures him on his theories of war, the [[human condition]] and civilization, while praising the ruthlessness and dedication of his adversaries, the Viet Cong. Kurtz discusses his family and asks that Willard tell his son about him after his death.\n\nThat night, as the Montagnards ceremonially slaughter a [[water buffalo]], Willard stealthily enters Kurtz's chamber as he is making a voice recording and attacks him with a machete. Mortally wounded, Kurtz utters \"...{{nbsp}}The horror ... the horror {{nbsp}}...\" and dies. All in the compound see Willard departing, carrying a collection of Kurtz's writings, and bow down to him. Willard then leads Lance to the boat and they sail away. Kurtz's final words echo eerily as everything [[Fade (lighting)|fades to black]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{About||a list of the rest of the cast members not included in the 153-minute version of the film that was released in theaters|Apocalypse Now Redux#Cast}}\n[[File:Marlon Brando (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The performance of [[Marlon Brando]] as [[Colonel Kurtz]] was critically acclaimed.<ref>{{cite web |first=Chas |last=Gerretsen|author-link=Chas Gerretsen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2019/may/30/the-horror-apocalypse-now-unseen-in-pictures |title=The horror!

The novella, based on Conrad's experience as a steamboat captain in Africa, is set in the [[Congo Free State]] during the 19th century.<ref>Murfin, Ross C (ed.) (1989): ''Joseph Conrad: Heart of Darkness. A Case Study in Contemporary Criticism''. Boston: St. Martin's Press, pp. 3\u201316.</ref> Kurtz and Marlow (whose corresponding character in the movie is Capt. Willard) work for a Belgian trading company that brutally exploits its native African workers.\n\nAfter arriving at Kurtz's outpost, Marlow concludes that Kurtz has gone insane and is lording over a small tribe as a god. The novella ends with Kurtz dying on the trip back and the narrator musing about the darkness of the human psyche: \"the heart of an immense darkness\".\n\nIn the novella, Marlow is the pilot of a river boat sent to collect ivory from Kurtz's outpost, only gradually becoming infatuated with Kurtz. In fact, when he discovers Kurtz in terrible health, Marlow makes an effort to bring him home safely. In the film, Willard is an assassin dispatched to kill Kurtz. Nevertheless, the depiction of Kurtz as a god-like leader of a tribe of natives and his malarial fever, Kurtz's written exclamation \"Exterminate all the brutes!\" (which appears in the film as \"Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all!\") and his last words \"The horror! The horror!\" are taken from Conrad's novella.\n\nCoppola argues that many episodes in the film\u2014the spear and arrow attack on the boat, for example\u2014respect the spirit of the novella and in particular its critique of the concepts of civilization and progress. Other episodes adapted by Coppola, the  Playboy Playmates' (Sirens) exit, the lost souls, \"take me home\" attempting to reach the boat and Kurtz's tribe of (white-faced) natives parting the canoes (gates of Hell) for Willard, (with Chef and Lance) to enter the camp are likened to Virgil and \"The Inferno\" ([[Divine Comedy]]) by [[Dante]]. While Coppola replaced European [[colonialism]] with American [[interventionism (politics)|interventionism]], the message of Conrad's book is still clear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberpat.com/essays/coppola.html |title=Heart of Darkness & Apocalypse Now: A comparative analysis of novella and film |publisher=Cyberpat.com |accessdate=March 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIt is often speculated that Coppola's interpretation of the [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Kurtz]] character was modeled after [[Tony Poe]], a highly decorated Vietnam-era paramilitary officer from the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]].<ref>Leary, William L. \"Death of a Legend\". Air America Archive. Retrieved June 10, 2007.</ref> Poe's actions in Vietnam and in the \"Secret War\" in neighboring Laos, in particular his highly unorthodox and often savage methods of waging war, show many similarities to those of the fictional Kurtz; for example, Poe was known to drop severed heads from helicopters into enemy-controlled villages as a form of [[psychological warfare]] and use human ears to record the number of enemies his indigenous troops had killed. He would send these ears back to his superiors as proof of the efficacy of his operations deep inside Laos.<ref>Warner, Roger. Shooting at the Moon.</ref><ref>Ehrlich, Richard S.

Eliot's poetry ===\nIn the film, shortly before Colonel Kurtz dies, he recites part of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem \"[[The Hollow Men]]\". The poem is preceded in printed editions by the epigraph \"Mistah Kurtz&nbsp;\u2013 he dead\", a quotation from Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness''.\n\nTwo books seen opened on Kurtz's desk in the film are ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]'' by [[Jessie Weston]] and ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' by [[Sir James Frazer]], the two books that Eliot cited as the chief sources and inspiration for his poem \"[[The Waste Land]]\". Eliot's original epigraph for \"The Waste Land\" was this passage from ''Heart of Darkness'', which ends with Kurtz's final words:<ref>Davidson, Harriet. \"Improper desire: reading ''The Waste Land''\" in Anthony David Moody (ed.). ''The Cambridge companion to T. S. Eliot''.

''Apocalypse Now'' had novel sound techniques for a movie, as Murch insisted on recording the most up-to-date gunfire and employed the [[Dolby Stereo 70&nbsp;mm Six Track]] system for the 70&nbsp;mm release.

Since his 1974 film ''[[The Conversation]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]], Coppola agreed to screen ''Apocalypse Now'' with only a month before the festival.

Coppola said the original ending was written in haste, where Kurtz convinced Willard to join forces and together they repelled the air strike on the compound. Coppola said he never fully agreed with the Kurtz and Willard dying in fatalistic explosive intensity, preferring to end the film in a more encouraging manner.\n\nWhen Coppola originally organized the ending, he considered two significantly different ends to the movie. One involved Willard leading Lance by the hand as everyone in Kurtz's base throws down their weapons, and ends with images of Willard piloting the PBR slowly away from Kurtz's compound, this final scene superimposed over the face of a stone idol, which then fades into black. The other option showed an air strike being called and the base being blown to bits in a spectacular display, consequently killing everyone left within it.\n\nThe original 1979 {{nowrap|70mm}} exclusive theatrical release ended with Willard's boat, the stone statue, then fade to black with no credits, save for '\"Copyright 1979 Omni Zoetrope\"' right after the film ends. This mirrors the lack of any opening titles and supposedly stems from Coppola's original intention to \"tour\" the film as one would a play: the credits would have appeared on printed programs provided before the screening began.<ref name=\"Cowie14\">Cowie 1990, p. 132.</ref>\n\nThere have been, to date, many variations of the end credit sequence, beginning with the 35&nbsp;mm general release version, where Coppola elected to show the credits superimposed over shots of the jungle exploding into flames.<ref name=\"Cowie14\" /> Rental prints circulated with this ending, and can be found in the hands of a few collectors. Some versions of this had the subtitle \"A United Artists release\", while others had \"An Omni Zoetrope release\". The network television version of the credits ended with \"...{{nbsp}}from MGM/UA Entertainment Company\" (the film made its network debut shortly after the merger of [[MGM]] and UA). One variation of the end credits can be seen on both YouTube and as a supplement on the current [[Lionsgate Home Entertainment|Lionsgate]] Blu-ray.\n\nLater when Coppola heard that audiences interpreted this as an air strike called by Willard, Coppola pulled the film from its {{nowrap|35 mm}} run and put credits on a black screen. However, the \"air strike\" footage continued to circulate in repertory theaters well into the 1980s, and it was included in the 1980s LaserDisc release. In the DVD commentary, Coppola explains that the images of explosions had not been intended to be part of the story; they were intended to be seen as completely separate from the film. He had added the explosions to the credits as a graphic background to the credits.<ref>Destruction of the Kurtz Compound w/ commentary by director [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. ''[[Apocalypse Now Redux]]'' DVD extras. November 20, 2001.</ref>\n\nCoppola explained he had captured the now-iconic footage during demolition of the sets (set destruction and removal was required by the Philippine government). Coppola filmed the demolition with multiple cameras fitted with different film stocks and lenses to capture the explosions at different speeds. He wanted to do something with the dramatic footage and decided to add them to the credits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homevideo.about.com/od/dvdreview1/a/apocalypsenowra.htm |title=DVD Review Apocalypse Now \u2013 Apocalypse Now DVD Review |publisher=Homevideo.about.com |date=March 5, 2014 |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' ===\n{{Main|Apocalypse Now Redux}}\nIn 2001, Coppola released ''Apocalypse Now Redux'' in cinemas and subsequently on DVD. This is an extended version that restores 49 minutes of scenes cut from the original film. Coppola has continued to circulate the original version as well: the two versions are packaged together in the ''Complete Dossier'' DVD, released on August 15, 2006 and in the Blu-ray edition released on October 19, 2010.\n\nThe longest section of added footage in the ''Redux'' version is the \"French Plantation\" sequence, a chapter involving the de Marais family's rubber plantation, a holdover from the colonization of [[French Indochina]], featuring Coppola's two sons [[Gian-Carlo Coppola|Gian-Carlo]] and [[Roman Coppola|Roman]] as children of the family. Around the dinner table, a young French child recites a poem by [[Charles Baudelaire]] entitled ''[[L'albatros (poem)|L'albatros]]''. The French family patriarch is not satisfied with the child's recitation. The child is sent away. These scenes were removed from the 1979 cut, which premiered at [[Festival de Cannes|Cannes]]. In behind-the-scenes footage in ''Hearts of Darkness'', Coppola expresses his anger, on the set, at the technical limitations of the scenes, the result of shortage of money. At the time of the ''Redux'' version, it was possible to digitally enhance the footage to accomplish Coppola's vision. In the scenes, the French family patriarchs argue about the positive side of colonialism in Indochina and denounce the betrayal of the military men in the [[First Indochina War]]. Hubert de Marais argues that French politicians sacrificed entire battalions at [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu|\u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]], and tells Willard that the US created the Viet Cong (as the [[Viet Minh]]) to fend off Japanese invaders.\n\nOther added material includes extra combat footage before Willard meets Kilgore, a humorous scene in which Willard's team steals Kilgore's surfboard (which sheds some light on the hunt for the mangoes), a follow-up scene to the dance of the ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmates, in which Willard's team finds the Playmates stranded after their helicopter has run out of fuel (trading two barrels of fuel for two hours with the Bunnies), and a scene of Kurtz reading from a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article about the war, surrounded by Cambodian children.\n\nA deleted scene titled \"Monkey Sampan\" shows Willard and the PBR crew suspiciously eyeing an approaching [[sampan]] juxtaposed to Montagnard villagers joyfully singing \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]]. As the sampan gets closer, Willard realizes there are monkeys on it and no helmsman. Finally, just as the two boats pass, the wind turns the sail and exposes a naked dead [[Viet Cong]] (VC) nailed to the sail boom.

The first [[Letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] appearance, on [[Laserdisc]] on December 29, 1991, cropped the film to a 2:1 aspect ratio (conforming to the [[Univisium]] spec created by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), and included a small degree of pan-and-scan processing at the insistence of Coppola and Storaro. The end credits, from a videotape source rather than a film print, were still crushed for 1.33:1 and zoomed to fit the anamorphic video frame. All DVD releases have maintained this aspect ratio in anamorphic widescreen, but present the film without the end credits, which were treated as a separate feature. The Blu-ray releases of ''Apocalypse Now'' restore the film to a 2.39:1 aspect ratio, making it the first home video release to display the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio.\n\nAs a DVD extra, the footage of the explosion of the Kurtz compound was featured without text credits but included commentary by Coppola, explaining the various endings based on how the film was screened.\n\nOn the cover of the ''Redux'' DVD, Willard is erroneously listed as \"Lieutenant Willard\".\n\nLionsgate released a 6-disc 40th anniversary edition on August 27, 2019. It includes two [[4K resolution|4K]] [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] discs and four standard Blu-ray discs, containing the theatrical version, ''Redux'', and the ''Final Cut'' featuring 4K restorations from the original camera negative. Previous extras (including the ''Hearts of Darkness'' documentary) have been re-used for this release, along with brand new content including a Tribeca Film Festival Q&A with Francis Ford Coppola and Steven Soderbergh and never-before-seen B-roll footage.<ref>https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=25025</ref>\n\n== Documentaries ==\n''Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'' (American Zoetrope/Cineplex Odeon Films) (1991) Directed by Eleanor Coppola, [[George Hickenlooper]], and Fax Bahr\n\n''Apocalypse Now \u2013 The Complete Dossier'' DVD ([[Paramount Home Entertainment]]) (2006).

But I like the idea that these things are connected somehow, whether it's linearly or literally or thematically.
