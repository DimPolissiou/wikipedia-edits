There, he set out along an old mining road known as the [[Stampede Trail]] with minimal supplies, hoping to [[Simple living|live simply]] off the land. On the eastern bank of the Sushana River, McCandless found an abandoned bus, [[Stampede_Trail#Bus_142|Fairbanks Bus 142]], which he used as a makeshift shelter until his death. In September, his [[human decomposition|decomposing]] body, weighing only 67 pounds (30 kilograms), was found by a hunter inside the bus.

He had been assigned the story and had written it under a tight deadline.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Krakauer, Jon |url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-chris-mccandless-died |title=How Chris McCandless Died |date=September 12, 2013 |work=The New Yorker}}</ref> Inspired by the details of McCandless' story, he wrote and published the more extensive biographical book ''Into the Wild'' in 1996. The book was subsequently adapted into a 2007 [[Into the Wild (film)|film]] directed by [[Sean Penn]], with [[Emile Hirsch]] portraying McCandless. That same year, McCandless' story also became the subject of [[Ron Lamothe]]'s documentary ''[[The Call of the Wild (2007 film)|The Call of the Wild]]'' (2007).\n\n==Early life==\nChristopher Johnson McCandless was born in [[El Segundo, California|El Segundo]], [[California]]. He was the first child of Wilhelmina \"Billie\" McCandless (n\u00e9e Johnson) and Walter \"Walt\" McCandless. Afterwards the couple had one more child, a daughter named Carine. McCandless also had six half-siblings from Walt's first marriage, who lived with their mother in California.

The couple went on to establish a successful consultancy business out of their home, specializing in Walt's area of expertise.\n\nMcCandless graduated from [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School|W.T.

It was during this journey he learned that his father had not yet divorced his first wife when McCandless and his sister Carine were born, and had apparently maintained somewhat of a [[double life]] before the move to Virginia.

A [[flash flood]] disabled his car, at which point he removed its license plates, took what he could carry, and kept moving on foot. His car was later found, repaired, and put into service as an undercover vehicle for the local police department.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |title=Into the Wild |date=1996 |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-48680-4 |location=New York |pages=28\u201329}}</ref>\n\n===Alaska===\nIn April 1992, McCandless [[hitchhiking|hitchhiked]] from South Dakota to [[Fairbanks, Alaska]]. He was last seen alive at the head of the [[Stampede Trail]] on April 28 by a local electrician named Jim Gallien, who had given McCandless a ride from Fairbanks to the start of the rugged track just outside the small town of [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]]. Gallien later said he had been seriously concerned about the safety of McCandless (who introduced himself as \"Alex\") after noticing his light pack, minimal equipment, meager rations, and obvious lack of experience. Gallien said he had deep doubts about \"Alex's\" ability to survive the harsh and unforgiving [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaskan bush]].\n\nGallien tried repeatedly to persuade McCandless to delay the trip, at one point offering to detour to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] and buy him suitable equipment and supplies. However, McCandless ignored Gallien's persistent warnings and refused his offers of assistance (though McCandless did accept a pair of [[Xtratuf]]s, two sandwiches, and a packet of corn chips from Gallien). Gallien dropped McCandless off believing he would head back towards the highway within a few days as hunger set in.<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997\" />\n\nAfter hiking along the snow-covered [[Stampede Trail]], McCandless came upon an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned bus]] (about {{convert|28|mi|km}} west of Healy at {{coord|63|52|5.96|N|149|46|8.39|W|display=inline}}) alongside an overgrown section of the trail near [[Denali National Park]]. McCandless, according to ''Into the Wild'', attempted to continue \"heading west until I hit the [[Bering Sea]].\" However, he was deterred by the thick Alaskan bush and returned to the bus, where he set up camp and attempted to live off the land. He had {{convert|4.5|kg|lb}} of rice, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] semi-automatic rifle with 400 rounds of [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]] [[hollowpoint]] ammunition, a number of books, including one on local plant life, some personal effects, and a few items of camping equipment. Self-portrait photographs and journal entries indicate he foraged for edible plants and hunted game. McCandless hunted [[porcupine]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and birds, such as [[White-tailed Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]]s and [[Canada geese]]. On June 9, 1992, he stalked and shot a [[moose]]. However, the meat spoiled within days after McCandless failed to properly preserve it.\n\nIt has been speculated that McCandless may have been responsible for [[vandalism|vandalizing]] several cabins in the area that were stocked with food, survival equipment, and emergency supplies. In response, Denali National Park Chief Ranger Ken Kehrer has categorically stated that McCandless was not considered a viable suspect by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 197</ref>\n\nMcCandless' journal documents 113 days in the area. In July, after living in the bus for a little over two months, he decided to head back to civilization &ndash; but the trail was blocked by the swollen [[Teklanika River]]; the watercourse by that stage was considerably higher and swifter than when he had crossed in April. McCandless did not have a detailed [[topography|topographical]] map of the region and was unaware of a hand-operated [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] that crossed the river a quarter-mile away from where he had previously crossed.<ref name=\"Krakauer\" /> At this point, McCandless headed back to the bus and re-established his camp. He posted an [[SOS|S.O.S.]] note on the bus, which stated: {{quote|Attention Possible Visitors. S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death, and too weak to hike out.

Swainsonine inhibits [[metabolism]] of [[glycoprotein]]s, which causes starvation despite ample caloric intake.<ref name=Krakauer2013/>\n\nHowever, in an article in the September 2007 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'', Matthew Powers states that extensive laboratory testing showed there were no toxins or alkaloids present in the ''H. alpinum'' seeds McCandless had been eating.

The ODAP, a toxic [[amino acid]], had not been detected by the previous studies of the seeds because they had suspected and tested for a toxic alkaloid, rather than an amino acid, and nobody had previously suspected that ''Hedysarum alpinum'' seeds contained this toxin.

Gallien dropped McCandless off believing he would head back towards the highway within a few days as hunger set in.<ref name=\"Krakauer 1997\" />\n\nAfter hiking along the snow-covered [[Stampede Trail]], McCandless came upon an [[Stampede Trail#Bus 142|abandoned bus]] (about {{convert|28|mi|km}} west of Healy at {{coord|63|52|5.96|N|149|46|8.39|W|display=inline}}) alongside an overgrown section of the trail near [[Denali National Park]]. McCandless, according to ''Into the Wild'', attempted to continue \"heading west until I hit the [[Bering Sea]].\" However, he was deterred by the thick Alaskan bush and returned to the bus, where he set up camp and attempted to live off the land. He had {{convert|4.5|kg|lb}} of rice, a [[Remington Arms|Remington]] semi-automatic rifle with 400 rounds of [[.22 Long Rifle|.22LR]] [[hollowpoint]] ammunition, a number of books, including one on local plant life, some personal effects, and a few items of camping equipment. Self-portrait photographs and journal entries indicate he foraged for edible plants and hunted game. McCandless hunted [[porcupine]]s, [[squirrel]]s, and birds, such as [[White-tailed Ptarmigan|ptarmigan]]s and [[Canada geese]]. On June 9, 1992, he stalked and shot a [[moose]]. However, the meat spoiled within days after McCandless failed to properly preserve it.\n\nIt has been speculated that McCandless may have been responsible for [[vandalism|vandalizing]] several cabins in the area that were stocked with food, survival equipment, and emergency supplies. In response, Denali National Park Chief Ranger Ken Kehrer has categorically stated that McCandless was not considered a viable suspect by the [[National Park Service]].<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 197</ref>\n\nMcCandless' journal documents 113 days in the area. In July, after living in the bus for a little over two months, he decided to head back to civilization &ndash; but the trail was blocked by the swollen [[Teklanika River]]; the watercourse by that stage was considerably higher and swifter than when he had crossed in April. McCandless did not have a detailed [[topography|topographical]] map of the region and was unaware of a hand-operated [[tramway (industrial)|tramway]] that crossed the river a quarter-mile away from where he had previously crossed.<ref name=\"Krakauer\" /> At this point, McCandless headed back to the bus and re-established his camp. He posted an [[SOS|S.O.S.]] note on the bus, which stated: {{quote|Attention Possible Visitors. S.O.S. I need your help. I am injured, near death, and too weak to hike out.

Upon entering, they smelled what they thought was rotting food and discovered \"a lump\" in a sleeping bag. The hunters quickly radioed police, who arrived the following day.

First, he offered that McCandless was running the risk of a phenomenon known as \"[[rabbit starvation]]\", from overrelying on lean game for nutrition.<ref>''Into the Wild'', page 188</ref> Krakauer also speculated<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/how-chris-mccandless-died |title=How Chris McCandless Died |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |date=September 12, 2013 |website=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=July 25, 2019}}</ref> that McCandless might have been poisoned by a toxic alkaloid called [[swainsonine]], by ingesting seeds (''[[Hedysarum alpinum]]'' or ''[[Hedysarum mackenzii]]'') containing the toxin, or possibly by a [[mould|mold]] that grows on them (''[[Rhizoctonia leguminicola]]'') when he put them damp into a plastic bag. Swainsonine inhibits [[metabolism]] of [[glycoprotein]]s, which causes starvation despite ample caloric intake.<ref name=Krakauer2013/>\n\nHowever, in an article in the September 2007 issue of ''[[Men's Journal]]'', Matthew Powers states that extensive laboratory testing showed there were no toxins or alkaloids present in the ''H. alpinum'' seeds McCandless had been eating. Dr. Thomas Clausen, the chair of the chemistry and biochemistry department at [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], said, \"I tore that plant apart. There were no toxins. No alkaloids.

The ODAP, a toxic [[amino acid]], had not been detected by the previous studies of the seeds because they had suspected and tested for a toxic alkaloid, rather than an amino acid, and nobody had previously suspected that ''Hedysarum alpinum'' seeds contained this toxin. The protein would be relatively harmless to someone who was well-fed and on a normal diet, but toxic to someone who was [[malnourishment|malnourished]], physically stressed, and on an irregular and insufficient diet, as McCandless was.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/when-edible-plants-turn-their-defenses-us |title=When Edible Plants Turn Their Defenses On Us |date=October 24, 2013 |website=usf.edu}}</ref> As Krakauer points out, McCandless' field guide did not warn of any dangers of eating the seeds, which were not yet known to be toxic.

The centre of power moved from coastal Demak, to Pajang in Blora, and later further inland to Mataram lands in [[Kotagede]], near present-day [[Yogyakarta]]. The Mataram Sultanate reached its peak of power and influence during the reign of [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo]] between 1613 and 1645.\n\n=== Colonial Java ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM 'Het veertig-jarig regeringsjubileum van Soesoehoenan Pakoe Boewono X van Surakarta in de stoet lopen serimpi's mee' TMnr 10001563.jpg|thumb|right|A Javanese courtly ceremony at Keraton Surakarta in 1932.]]\n\nIn 1619 the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] established their trading headquarter in [[Jakarta|Batavia]]. Java slowly fell to the [[Dutch East India Company]], which would also eventually control most of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The internal intrigue and war of succession, in addition to Dutch interference, caused the Mataram Sultanate to break up into [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]]. The further separation of the Javanese realm was marked by the establishment of the [[Mangkunegaran]] and [[Pakualaman]] princedom. Although the real political power in those days actually lay with the colonial Dutch, the Javanese kings, in their [[keraton]]s, still held prestige as the supposed power centre of the Javanese realm, especially in and around Surakarta and Yogyakarta.\n\nDutch rule was briefly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in the early 19th century. While short, the British administration led by [[Stamford Raffles]] was significant, and included the re-discovery of [[Borobudur]]. Conflict with foreign rule was exemplified by the [[Java War]] between 1825 and 1830, and the leadership of Prince [[Diponegoro]].\n\nLike the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]], Java was captured by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. With Japan's defeat, independence was proclaimed in the new [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n===Republic of Indonesia===\nWhen the Indonesian independence was proclaimed on 17 August 1945, the last sovereign Javanese monarchies, represented by the Sri Sultan of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], the Sunanate of [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and Prince of Mangkunegara declared that they would become part of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nYogyakarta and Pakualam were later united to form the [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta Special Region]]. The Sri sultan became Governor of Yogyakarta, and the Prince of Pakualaman became vice-governor; both were responsible to the President of Indonesia. The Special Region of Yogyakarta was created after the war of independence ended and formalised on 3 August 1950. Surakarta was later absorbed as part of the [[Central Java]] province.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main article|Javanese culture}}\n{{See also|Javanese dance|Javanisation}}\n[[File:Wayang Performance.jpg|thumb|right|Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[wayang]] and [[gamelan]] are often used to promote the excellence of Javanese culture.]]\nThe [[Javanese culture]] is one of the oldest civilisations and has flourished in Indonesia. It has gradually absorbed various elements and influences from other cultures, including native reverence for ancestral and natural spirits, [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] dharmic civilisation, Islamic values, and to a lesser extent, Christianity, Western philosophy and modern ideas. Nevertheless, Javanese culture \u2014 especially in the Javanese cultural heartland; those of highly polished aristocratic culture of the ''[[keraton]]s'' in [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] \u2014 demonstrates some specific traits, such as particular concern with elegance and refinement (Javanese: ''alus''), subtlety, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese culture values harmony and social order highly, and abhors direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values are often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[Javanese dance]], [[gamelan]], [[wayang]] and [[batik]]. It is also reinforced through adherence to Javanese ''adat'' (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as ''[[Slametan]], [[Satu Suro]]'', Javanese weddings and ''[[Naloni Mitoni]]''.\n\nHowever, the culture of ''pesisiran'' of Javanese north coast and in Eastern Java demonstrates some slightly different traits. They tend to be more open to new and foreign ideas, more egalitarian, and less conscious of one's social stature. Some of these northern settlements \u2014 such as Demak, Kudus, Tuban, Gresik and Ampel in Surabaya \u2014 have become more overtly Islamic, traditionally because these port towns are among the earliest places that Islamic teachings gained foothold in Java.\n[[File:Gamelan Player 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gamelan]] is one of Javanese cultural expression that demonstrate refinement.]]\nJavanese culture is traditionally centred in the [[Central Java]], [[Yogyakarta]] and [[East Java]] provinces of Indonesia.

The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant [[Islamic holidays]]. The Javanese calendar is presently used mostly for cultural events (such as [[Satu Sura|Siji Sur\u00e5]]). The Javanese calendar system is currently a lunar calendar adopted by [[Sultan Agung]] in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the [[Hindu calendar]].\n\nUnlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the ''[[Javanese calendar#Five-day week (Pasaran)|Pasaran]]'' cycle. This is still in use today and is superimposed with 7-day week of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|Wetonan cycle]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{main article|Javanese traditional house}}\n[[File:RUMAHJAWA 1.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Javanese house.]]\nThroughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist [[stupa]], mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques.\n\nTwo important religious monuments are the Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] and the Buddhist temple of [[Borobudur]]. Both of them are 9th century temples and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s. Both are located near [[Yogyakarta]] in the slope of Mount Merapi.\n\nMeanwhile, examples of secular buildings can be seen in the ruins of the former capital city of the [[Majapahit]] Kingdom (14th to 16th century AD) in [[Trowulan]], [[East Java]].

Javanese names may come from traditional Javanese languages, many of which are derived from [[Sanskrit]]. Names with the prefix ''Su-'', which means ''good'', are very popular. After the advent of Islam, many Javanese began to use [[Arabic]] names, especially coast populations, where Islamic influences are stronger. Commoners usually only have one-word names, while nobilities use two-or-more-word names, but rarely a surname. Some people use a [[patronymic]]. Due to the influence of other cultures, many people started using names from other languages, mainly [[European languages]].

The centre of power moved from coastal Demak, to Pajang in Blora, and later further inland to Mataram lands in [[Kotagede]], near present-day [[Yogyakarta]].

Java slowly fell to the [[Dutch East India Company]], which would also eventually control most of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The internal intrigue and war of succession, in addition to Dutch interference, caused the Mataram Sultanate to break up into [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]]. The further separation of the Javanese realm was marked by the establishment of the [[Mangkunegaran]] and [[Pakualaman]] princedom. Although the real political power in those days actually lay with the colonial Dutch, the Javanese kings, in their [[keraton]]s, still held prestige as the supposed power centre of the Javanese realm, especially in and around Surakarta and Yogyakarta.\n\nDutch rule was briefly interrupted by [[United Kingdom|British]] rule in the early 19th century. While short, the British administration led by [[Stamford Raffles]] was significant, and included the re-discovery of [[Borobudur]]. Conflict with foreign rule was exemplified by the [[Java War]] between 1825 and 1830, and the leadership of Prince [[Diponegoro]].\n\nLike the rest of the [[Dutch East Indies]], Java was captured by the [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]]. With Japan's defeat, independence was proclaimed in the new [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n===Republic of Indonesia===\nWhen the Indonesian independence was proclaimed on 17 August 1945, the last sovereign Javanese monarchies, represented by the Sri Sultan of [[Yogyakarta Sultanate|Yogyakarta]], the Sunanate of [[Surakarta Sunanate|Surakarta]] and Prince of Mangkunegara declared that they would become part of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nYogyakarta and Pakualam were later united to form the [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta Special Region]]. The Sri sultan became Governor of Yogyakarta, and the Prince of Pakualaman became vice-governor; both were responsible to the President of Indonesia. The Special Region of Yogyakarta was created after the war of independence ended and formalised on 3 August 1950. Surakarta was later absorbed as part of the [[Central Java]] province.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main article|Javanese culture}}\n{{See also|Javanese dance|Javanisation}}\n[[File:Wayang Performance.jpg|thumb|right|Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[wayang]] and [[gamelan]] are often used to promote the excellence of Javanese culture.]]\nThe [[Javanese culture]] is one of the oldest civilisations and has flourished in Indonesia. It has gradually absorbed various elements and influences from other cultures, including native reverence for ancestral and natural spirits, [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] dharmic civilisation, Islamic values, and to a lesser extent, Christianity, Western philosophy and modern ideas. Nevertheless, Javanese culture \u2014 especially in the Javanese cultural heartland; those of highly polished aristocratic culture of the ''[[keraton]]s'' in [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] \u2014 demonstrates some specific traits, such as particular concern with elegance and refinement (Javanese: ''alus''), subtlety, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature. Javanese culture values harmony and social order highly, and abhors direct conflicts and disagreements. These Javanese values are often promoted through Javanese cultural expressions, such as [[Javanese dance]], [[gamelan]], [[wayang]] and [[batik]]. It is also reinforced through adherence to Javanese ''adat'' (traditional rules) in ceremonies, such as ''[[Slametan]], [[Satu Suro]]'', Javanese weddings and ''[[Naloni Mitoni]]''.\n\nHowever, the culture of ''pesisiran'' of Javanese north coast and in Eastern Java demonstrates some slightly different traits. They tend to be more open to new and foreign ideas, more egalitarian, and less conscious of one's social stature. Some of these northern settlements \u2014 such as Demak, Kudus, Tuban, Gresik and Ampel in Surabaya \u2014 have become more overtly Islamic, traditionally because these port towns are among the earliest places that Islamic teachings gained foothold in Java.\n[[File:Gamelan Player 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Gamelan]] is one of Javanese cultural expression that demonstrate refinement.]]\nJavanese culture is traditionally centred in the [[Central Java]], [[Yogyakarta]] and [[East Java]] provinces of Indonesia.

The Gregorian calendar is the official calendar of Indonesia, while the Islamic calendar is used by Muslims and Indonesian government for religious worship and deciding relevant [[Islamic holidays]]. The Javanese calendar is presently used mostly for cultural events (such as [[Satu Sura|Siji Sur\u00e5]]). The Javanese calendar system is currently a lunar calendar adopted by [[Sultan Agung]] in 1633, based on the Islamic calendar. Previously, Javanese people used a solar system based on the [[Hindu calendar]].\n\nUnlike many other calendars, the Javanese calendar uses a 5-day week known as the ''[[Javanese calendar#Five-day week (Pasaran)|Pasaran]]'' cycle. This is still in use today and is superimposed with 7-day week of the [[Gregorian calendar]] and [[Islamic calendar]] to become what is known as the 35-day [[Javanese calendar#Wetonan cycle|Wetonan cycle]].\n\n===Architecture===\n{{main article|Javanese traditional house}}\n[[File:RUMAHJAWA 1.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional Javanese house.]]\nThroughout their long history, the Javanese have produced many important buildings, ranging from Hindu monuments, Buddhist [[stupa]], mortuary temples, palace complexes, and mosques.\n\nTwo important religious monuments are the Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] and the Buddhist temple of [[Borobudur]]. Both of them are 9th century temples and [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

These, along with exiles from other ethnicities like [[Bugis]] and [[Malay people|Malay]] became the [[Sri Lankan Malay]]<ref name=srilankan/> and [[Cape Malay]]<ref name=cape/> ethnic groups respectively. Other political prisoners were transported to closer places. Prince [[Diponegoro]] and his followers were transported to [[North Sulawesi]], following his defeat in [[Java War]] in the early 19th century. Their descendants are well known as [[Jatons|Jaton]] (abbreviation of \"Jawa Tondano\"/Tondano Javanese).\n\nMajor migrations started during the Dutch colonial period under [[Transmigration program]]s. The Dutch needed many labourers for their plantations and moved many Javanese under the program as contract workers, mostly to other parts of the colony in Sumatra. They also sent Javanese workers to [[Suriname]] in South America.<ref name=\"ino\"/> As of 2019, approximately 13.7% of the Suriname population is of Javanese ancestry.<ref name=\"suriname\"/> Outside of the Dutch colonies, Javanese workers were also sent to plantations administrated by the Dutch colonial government in [[New Caledonia]], a French territory.<ref name=\"ino\">{{Cite journal |url=https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/publication61151 |title=Indonesians overseas - deep histories and the view from below |last1=Martinez|first1= J.T|last2=Vickers|first2=A.H|year=2012|journal=Indonesia and the Malay World|volume= 40|issue=117|page=111-121|access-date=28 December 2019|doi= 10.1080/13639811.2012.683667}}</ref>\n\nThe Transmigration program that was created by the Dutch continued following independence. A significant Javanese population can be found in the Jabodetabek ([[Greater Jakarta]]) area, [[Lampung]], [[South Sumatra]] and [[Jambi]] provinces.

{"title_page": "Mushroom hunting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Mushrooming|the 2012 Estonian film|Mushrooming (film)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2017}}\n[[File:KostrzewskiFranciszek.Grzybobranie.1860.jpg|360 px|thumb|''Mushroom picking'' by [[Franciszek Kostrzewski]]]]\n[[File:Edible fungi in basket 2012 G1.jpg|thumb|right|A basket of edible mushrooms from Ukraine]]\n\n'''Mushroom hunting''', '''mushrooming''', '''mushroom picking''', '''mushroom [[foraging]]''', '''shrooming''', and similar terms describe the activity of gathering [[mushroom]]s in the wild, typically for food. This practice is popular throughout most of [[Europe]],  [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], parts of the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]], as well as the [[temperate climate|temperate]] regions of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\n== Identifying mushrooms ==\n[[Image:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|thumb|right|Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushroom, such as those illustrated in the above chart, are essential for correct mushroom identification.]]\n\nA large number of mushroom species are favored for eating by mushroom hunters.  The [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]] is a popular delicacy. [[Sulphur shelf]] (also known as chicken mushroom and chicken of the woods) is often gathered because it occurs in bulk, recurs year after year, is easily identified, and has a wide variety of culinary uses. [[Pine mushroom]]s, [[chanterelle]]s, [[morel]]s, [[oyster mushroom]]s, [[puffballs]] and [[polypore]]s are among the most popular types of mushrooms to gather, most of these being fairly simple to properly identify by anyone with practice. Much more care, education, and experience is typically required to make a positive identification of many species, however, and as such, few collect from more dangerous groups, such as ''[[Amanita]]'', which include some of the most [[Alpha-amanitin|toxic mushrooms]] in existence.\n\nMany [[field guide]]s on mushrooms are available and recommended to help safely distinguish edible from the many poisonous mushrooms.\n\nIdentification is not the only element of mushroom hunting that takes practice; knowing where and when to search does as well. Most mushroom species require very specific conditions. Some only grow at the base of a certain type of tree, for example. Finding a desired species that is known to grow in a certain region can be a challenge.\n\n=== Safety issues ===\n[[File:Clitocybe rivulosa 20081116w.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Clitocybe rivulosa]]'' is an example of a deadly mushroom species sometimes misidentified as an edible species.]]\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{tone|date=December 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n{{details|Mushroom poisoning|List of deadly fungi}}\nA Czech adage warns that \"{{lang|cs|v\u0161echny houby jsou jedl\u00e9, ale n\u011bkter\u00e9 jenom jednou.}}\" Translated, that \"every mushroom is edible, but some only once.\"\nSome mushrooms are deadly or extremely hazardous when consumed. Some that are not deadly can nevertheless cause permanent organ damage.\n\nCommon safety advice includes:\n* That only positively identified mushrooms should be eaten\n* That mushrooms be identified a second time during preparation and to cook them unless it can be verified that the species can be eaten raw\n* That mushroom types not be combined\n* That a sample of any mushroom not well-experienced will be retained for analysis in case of poisoning\n* Familiarity with information about deadly mushrooms that are look-alikes of edible ones, as \"deadly twins\" differ regionally.\n* When picking mushrooms in an unfamiliar region, e.g. in a foreign country or in an area a considerable distance from one's usual foraging sites, to exercise great caution even with mushrooms that are positively identified as edible based on prior experience. Mushroom guides explaining local species should be studied thoroughly.\n* Not gathering mushrooms that are difficult to identify. This applies especially to the mushrooms of the [[genus]] ''[[Amanita]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius]]'' and \"little brown mushrooms\".\n* Consuming only a small amount the first time a new species is tried. People react differently to different mushrooms, and all mushroom species can cause an adverse reaction in a few individuals, even the common [[champignon]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Marco H.

Experienced mushroomers may discern more subtle identifying traits that help narrow the mushroom down to a particular genus or group of species, but exact identification of LBMs often requires close examination of microscopic characteristics plus a certain degree of familiarity or specialization in that particular group.\n\nFor mycologists, LBMs are the equivalent of LBJs (\"[[little brown job]]s\") and DYCs (\"[[damned yellow composite]]s\") that are the bane of ornithologists and botanists, respectively.\n\n\"Big white mushroom\" (or BWM) is also sometimes used to describe groups of difficult to identify larger and paler agarics, many of which are in the genus ''[[Clitocybe]].''\n\n=== Psychotropics ===\n[[File:Psilocybe semilanceata.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is hunted for its psychotropic properties.]]\n{{details|Psilocybin mushrooms}}\nThe ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'''s [[psychotropic]] properties have been traditionally used by shamans in [[Siberia]] in their rituals. However, its use for such purposes today is very rare, despite the mushroom's abundance. Instead, the ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is sought after for its hallucinogenic properties, the latter being more desirable with fewer side effects than those of ''A. muscaria''. The use of ''P. semilanceata'' is however significantly hindered by its small size, requiring larger quantities and being hard to spot. Other Psilocybe species are abundant in the American south and west, as well as Mexico, where they have been used by traditional shamans for centuries. In the west, one can often find mushroom pickers in cow pastures in a stereotypical stoop looking in the grass for psilocybes. This can be quite dangerous, as many species grow in pastures and amateurs often misidentify psilocybes.\n* ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (\u041c\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 [Mukhomor Krasniy] - Red Fly-Killer; ''Fly Agaric, Toadstool'')\n* ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' (\u041f\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0431\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f [Psilotsiba Sosochkovidnaya] - Nipple-Like Psylocybe; ''Liberty Cap'')\n{{clear}}\n\n== Regional importance ==\n[[File:Mashrooms on varena roadside.jpg|thumb|Locals are selling mushrooms and berries collected in the [[Dainava Forest]], [[Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Market Mushrooms.JPG|thumb|250px|Forest-picked mushrooms at a Ukrainian market in [[Kolomyia]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n*In the United States mushroom picking is popular in the Appalachian area and on the west coast from San Francisco Bay northward, in northern [[California]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and in many other regions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n*British enthusiasts today enjoy an extended average picking season of 75 days compared to just 33 in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gange |first=A.

After a heavy rain during the mushroom season whole families often venture into the nearest forest, picking bucketfuls of mushrooms, which are cooked and eaten for dinner upon return (most often in omelettes with eggs or fried in butter) or alternatively dried or [[marination|marinated]] for later consumption.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe popularity of mushroom picking in some parts of the world has led to mushroom festivals. The festivals are usually between September and October, depending on the mushrooms available in a particular region. Festivals in North America include:\n*Bamfield, British Columbia \u2014 Bamfield Fungus Festival\n*[[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], Illinois - Houby Festival\n*Boyne City, Michigan\u2014Annual National Morel Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morelfest.com/|title=National Morel Mushroom Festival - Official site for the Mushroom Festival held each May in Boyne City, Michigan|website=www.morelfest.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* Buena Vista, Colorado\u2014Buena Vista Heritage's Mushroom Festival\n*Washington's Long Beach Peninsula\u2014Wild Mushroom Celebration\n*Lake Quinault Lodge in Washington's Olympic National Forest\u2014Quinault Rain Forest Mushroom Festival\n*Mendocino County (North of San Francisco)--Mushroom Festival\n*Madisonville, Texas\u2014Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmushroomfestival.com/|title=Texas Mushroom festival|website=www.texasmushroomfestival.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]], Colorado\u2014Telluride Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telluridemushroomfest.org/|title=Telluride Mushroom Festival - Mushroom Hunting - Mushroom Expert|website=Telluride Mushroom Fest|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n*Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*Girdwood, Alaska\u2014Fungus Fair\n*Muscoda, Wisconsin\u2014Morel Mushroom Festival\n*Eugene, Oregon\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*Richmond, Missouri\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand-Mushroom Ball\n*Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Czech Village-Houby Days Festival\n\n=== Radiation ===\n[[Nuclear fallout]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] is an important issue concerning mushroom picking in Europe. Due to the wide spread of their [[mycelium]], mushrooms tend to accumulate more radioactive [[caesium-137]] than surrounding soil and other organisms. State agencies (e.g. [[Bellesrad]] in Belarus) monitor and analyze the degree of [[radionuclide]] accumulation in various wild species of plants and animals. In particular, Bellesrad claims that Svinushka (''[[Paxillus]]'' ssp.), Maslenok (''[[Suillus]]'' ssp.), Mokhovik (''[[Xerocomus]]'' ssp.), and Horkushka (''[[Lactarius rufus]]'') are the worst ones in this respect. The safest one is Opyonok Osyenniy (''[[Armillaria mellea]]''). This is an issue not only in [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]: the fallout also reached western Europe, and until recently the German government discouraged people gathering certain mushrooms.\n\nThe situation is treated with black humor in some [[Russian jokes#Chernobyl|Russian jokes]].''\n\n== Guidelines for mushroom picking ==\n\n=== Poisonous mushrooms commonly confused with edible ones ===\n{{See also|Mushroom poisoning#Poisonous species|List of deadly fungi}}\nMany mushroom guidebooks call attention to similarities between species, especially significant if an edible species is similar to, or commonly confused with, one that is potentially harmful.\n\nExamples:\n* False chanterelles (''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]''), as the name suggests, can look like real chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus]] cibarius'') to the inexperienced eye. The latter do not have sharp gills, but rather blunt veins on the underside.  Misidentification in this case is not likely to prove significantly dangerous, as false chanterelles are considered edible, but unpleasant tasting. Mild symptoms have been reported from consuming them.<ref>Arora, David.  Mushrooms Demystified.  Ten Speed Press, 1986</ref> Conversely, the [[Jack O'Lantern mushroom]] is often mistaken for a chanterelle, and it is potently toxic.\n* True morels are distinguished from [[false morel]]s (''[[Gyromitra|Gyromitra spp.]]'' and ''[[Verpa|Verpa spp.]]''). False morels have caps attached at the top of the stalk, while true morels have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.\n* Immature ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' can be confused with edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' and ''[[Macrolepiota]]'' mushrooms.\n* Immature [[puffball]]s are generally edible, but care must be taken to avoid species such as ''[[Scleroderma citrinum]]'' and immature ''[[Amanita]]''s. These can be identified by cutting a puffball in half and looking for a dark reticulated [[gleba]] or the articulated, nonhomogeneous structures of a gilled mushroom, respectively.\n* Highly poisonous ''[[Conocybe filaris]]'' and some ''[[Galerina]]'' species can resemble ''[[Psilocybe]]'', and the species are observed growing alongside each other. Psilocybe species are not deadly but contain the alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin, known to cause hallucinogenic effects; therefore it is often sought for use as a recreational psychedelic drug.\n\n=== Eating poisonous species ===\nThere are treatments to reduce or eliminate the toxicity of certain (but not all) poisonous species to the point where they may be edible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamrubel.com/wild-mushrooms/amanita-muscaria/|title=Amanita muscaria, edibile if parboiled|date=30 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> For instance, [[false morel]]s are deadly poisonous when eaten raw or incorrectly prepared, but their toxins can be reduced by a proper method of parboiling. Prepared in this way, this mushroom is widely used and considered a delicacy in many European countries, although recent research suggests that there may still be long-term health consequences from eating it.<ref>[http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf_files/Poisonings30year.pdf Michael W.

While being a general mushroom hunting guideline, the avoidance of specimens growing in areas with high [[pollution]] is especially important with this family, as it is a very effective pollutant absorber.\n* ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]'' (parasol mushroom)\n\n=== Amanitaceae ===\nWhile the family of amanitas are approached with extreme caution, as it contains the lethal ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' and ''[[Amanita virosa]]'', those confident in their skills often pick the ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'', which is highly prized in [[Europe]] and to a much lesser extent in Russia, accounted by some not to superior taste, but to its relation to the ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'', which is not found in Russia, but was considered a delicacy worthy of the emperor in [[Ancient Rome]].\n* ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'' (European blusher)\n* ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' (Caesar's mushroom)\n\n=== Boletaceae ===\n\n[[File:Cep in basket 2006 G01.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of ''[[Boletus edulis]]'']]\n\nThis order is often viewed as the order of \"noble\" mushrooms, containing few poisonous species, identifiable with relative ease, and having superior palatability. The most notable species is the ''[[Boletus edulis]]'', the \"mushroom king\", an almost legendary, relatively rare mushroom, edible in almost any (even raw) form, and commonly considered ''the'' best-tasting mushroom.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (It is common to confuse the Russian name, literally \"white mushroom\", with [[champignon]]s, often known in English as \"white mushrooms\".)\n* ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' (''H\u0159ib Smrkov\u00fd, Dub\u00e1k, Borowik szlachetny, Porcino, King Bolete, Cep, Steinpilz'')\n\nThe genus ''Leccinum'' includes two well-known mushroom species named after the trees they can usually be found next to. The ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (as well as the ''[[Leccinum versipelle]]''), found under [[aspen]] trees, and the ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (as well as the ''[[L. holopus]]''), found under [[birch]] trees. The secondary mentioned species, are significantly different in cap colour only. Both types are very sought after, being highly palatable, while more common than the B. edulis.\n* ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (red-capped scaber stalk)\n* ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (birch bolete)\n\nThe genus ''[[Suillus]]'', characterised by its slimy cap, is another prized mushroom, the ''[[Suillus luteus]]'' and ''[[Suillus granulatus]]'' being its most common varieties, and while abundant in some parts of Eurasia, is a rare occurrence in others. It is easy to identify and very palatable.\n* ''[[Suillus]]'' (klouzek, slippery Jack, butter mushroom)\n\nThe genus ''[[Xerocomus]]'' is generally considered a less desirable (though mostly edible) mushroom group, due to common abundant [[Mold (fungus)|mould]] growth on their caps, which can make them poisonous. The ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'', however is an exception, being moderately sought after, especially in Europe. Some scientific classifications now consider species in the genus ''Xerocomus'' as members of ''Boletus''.\n* ''[[Xerocomus]]'' (mossiness mushroom)\n* ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'' (''h\u0159ib hn\u011bd\u00fd'')\n\n=== Cantharellaceae ===\n\n[[File:--GFDL--Voveraite.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chanterelle]]s]]\n\nThe ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'', a common and popular mushroom, especially in Europe, is a choice edible and unique mushroom. It is very rarely infested by [[worm]]s or [[larva]]e, has a unique appearance, and when rotting, the decomposed parts are easily distinguishable and separable from those that are edible.\n* ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (chanterelle, yellow chanterelle, pfifferling)\n\n=== Helvellaceae ===\n\nThe ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' is considered poisonous, but can be consumed if dried and stored for over a year, according to Slavic literature, and can be used to supplement or replace [[morel]] (see ''Morchellaceae'' below) mushrooms, while Western literature claims that even the fumes of the mushroom are dangerous. It is similar to morels both in appearance and palatability.\n* ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' (false morel, beefsteak morel, lorchel)\n\n=== Morchellaceae ===\n\n[[File:Mushroom Magic Meal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A basket of [[Morchella|morels]]]]\n\nThe morel, ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' is highly prized in Western Europe, India and North America. It is significantly less prized in Slavic countries where, like the ''Gyromitra esculenta'', it is considered marginally edible with mediocre palatability. Boiling the mushroom and discarding the water is often recommended.\n* ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' (morel, yellow morel)\n\n=== Lactarius ===\n\nMembers of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'', as the name suggests, lactate a milky liquid when wounded and are often scoffed upon by Western literature. The ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' is however regarded as one of the most palatable mushrooms in Slavic culture, comparable to the ''Boletus edulis''. Also considered as similarly palatable are the species ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' and particularly ''[[Lactarius resimus]]''. Thermal treatment may however be necessary in some cases. Slightly less appealing due to its bitter taste is the ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]''.\n* ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' (saffron milk-cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius resimus]]'' (pepper cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' (black pepper cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]'' (wooly milk-cap)\n\n=== Russulaceae ===\n\nThe [[Russula]] family includes over 750 species and is one of the most common and abundant mushrooms in Eurasia.  Their cap colours include red, brown, yellow, blue and green and can be easily spotted. The ''[[Russula vesca]]'' species, one of the many red-capped varieties, is one of the most common, is reasonably palatable and can be eaten raw.  The edible Russulas have a mild taste, compared to many inedible or poisonous species that have a strong hot or bitter taste - but notice that the deadly poisonous Amanita phalloides, Amanita virosa and many other poisonous mushrooms have mild taste! The ''[[Russula emetica]]'' (the sickener) is known to cause gastrointestinal upset and has a very hot taste when a small bit is placed on the tongue.  Due to their abundance they are however often regarded as an inferior mushroom for hunting, since they may be eaten if [[parboiled]].\n* ''[[Russula vesca]]'' (Russula)\n\n=== Tricholomataceae ===\n\n* ''[[Armillaria]]'' (honey mushroom, shoestring rot). The genus ''[[Armillaria]]'', with the popular species ''A. gallica'' and ''A. mellea'', being so similar that they are rarely differentiated, are palatable, highly abundant mushrooms. Generally found on decaying [[tree stump]]s, they grow in very large quantities and are easy to spot and identify, arguably reducing the fun and challenge in mushroom hunting.\n* ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'' (oyster mushroom). It is the most commonly picked tree-dwelling mushroom and is often also artificially cultivated for sale in grocery stores. This sturdy mushroom can be quite palatable when young. Growing these mushrooms at home can be a profitable enterprise and some Russians engage in the activity.\n\n[[Image:matsutakeredpinemushroomhunting.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Matsutake]]'', the highly sought-after pine mushroom, found in [[coniferous]] forests in [[Hiroshima]] in autumn]]\n\n*''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' - = syn. ''T. nauseosum'', the rare red pine mushroom that has a very fine aroma. Its fragrance is both sweet and spicy. They grow under trees and are usually concealed under fallen leaves and the duff layer. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of a limited number of tree species. In Japan it is most commonly associated with Japanese red pine. However, in the Pacific Northwest it is found in coniferous forests of [[Douglas fir]], [[noble fir]], [[sugar pine]], and [[Ponderosa pine]]. Farther south, it is also associated with hardwoods, namely [[tanoak]] and [[madrone]] forests. The Pacific Northwest and other similar temperate regions along the Pacific Rim also hold great habitat producing these and other quality wild mushrooms. In 1999, N. Bergius and E. Danell reported that Swedish (''Tricholoma nauseosum'') and Japanese matsutake (''T. matsutake'') are the same species. The report caused the increased import from Northern Europe to Japan because of the comparable flavor and taste. Matsutake are difficult to find and are therefore very expensive. Moreover, domestic productions of Matsutake in Japan have been sharply reduced over the last fifty years due to a pine [[nematode]] ''[[Bursaphelenchus xylophilus]]'', and it has influenced the price a great deal. The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan has since further decreased. The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability and origin. The Japanese matsutake at the beginning of the season, which is the highest grade, can go up to $2000 per kilogram, while the average value for imported matsutake from China, Europe, and the United States is only about $90 per kilogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2368|title=Finding and Preparing The Elusive Matsutake Mushroom|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* The ''[[Tricholoma magnivelare]]'' is a prized mushroom in North America.

This practice is popular throughout most of [[Europe]],  [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], parts of the [[Middle East]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]], as well as the [[temperate climate|temperate]] regions of [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\n== Identifying mushrooms ==\n[[Image:Mushroom cap morphology2.png|thumb|right|Morphological characteristics of the caps of mushroom, such as those illustrated in the above chart, are essential for correct mushroom identification.]]\n\nA large number of mushroom species are favored for eating by mushroom hunters.  The [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]] is a popular delicacy. [[Sulphur shelf]] (also known as chicken mushroom and chicken of the woods) is often gathered because it occurs in bulk, recurs year after year, is easily identified, and has a wide variety of culinary uses. [[Pine mushroom]]s, [[chanterelle]]s, [[morel]]s, [[oyster mushroom]]s, [[puffballs]] and [[polypore]]s are among the most popular types of mushrooms to gather, most of these being fairly simple to properly identify by anyone with practice. Much more care, education, and experience is typically required to make a positive identification of many species, however, and as such, few collect from more dangerous groups, such as ''[[Amanita]]'', which include some of the most [[Alpha-amanitin|toxic mushrooms]] in existence.\n\nMany [[field guide]]s on mushrooms are available and recommended to help safely distinguish edible from the many poisonous mushrooms.\n\nIdentification is not the only element of mushroom hunting that takes practice; knowing where and when to search does as well. Most mushroom species require very specific conditions. Some only grow at the base of a certain type of tree, for example. Finding a desired species that is known to grow in a certain region can be a challenge.\n\n=== Safety issues ===\n[[File:Clitocybe rivulosa 20081116w.JPG|thumb|right|''[[Clitocybe rivulosa]]'' is an example of a deadly mushroom species sometimes misidentified as an edible species.]]\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{tone|date=December 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2012}}\n}}\n{{details|Mushroom poisoning|List of deadly fungi}}\nA Czech adage warns that \"{{lang|cs|v\u0161echny houby jsou jedl\u00e9, ale n\u011bkter\u00e9 jenom jednou.}}\" Translated, that \"every mushroom is edible, but some only once.\"\nSome mushrooms are deadly or extremely hazardous when consumed. Some that are not deadly can nevertheless cause permanent organ damage.\n\nCommon safety advice includes:\n* That only positively identified mushrooms should be eaten\n* That mushrooms be identified a second time during preparation and to cook them unless it can be verified that the species can be eaten raw\n* That mushroom types not be combined\n* That a sample of any mushroom not well-experienced will be retained for analysis in case of poisoning\n* Familiarity with information about deadly mushrooms that are look-alikes of edible ones, as \"deadly twins\" differ regionally.\n* When picking mushrooms in an unfamiliar region, e.g. in a foreign country or in an area a considerable distance from one's usual foraging sites, to exercise great caution even with mushrooms that are positively identified as edible based on prior experience. Mushroom guides explaining local species should be studied thoroughly.\n* Not gathering mushrooms that are difficult to identify. This applies especially to the mushrooms of the [[genus]] ''[[Amanita]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius]]'' and \"little brown mushrooms\".\n* Consuming only a small amount the first time a new species is tried. People react differently to different mushrooms, and all mushroom species can cause an adverse reaction in a few individuals, even the common [[champignon]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=Marco H.

Experienced mushroomers may discern more subtle identifying traits that help narrow the mushroom down to a particular genus or group of species, but exact identification of LBMs often requires close examination of microscopic characteristics plus a certain degree of familiarity or specialization in that particular group.\n\nFor mycologists, LBMs are the equivalent of LBJs (\"[[little brown job]]s\") and DYCs (\"[[damned yellow composite]]s\") that are the bane of ornithologists and botanists, respectively.\n\n\"Big white mushroom\" (or BWM) is also sometimes used to describe groups of difficult to identify larger and paler agarics, many of which are in the genus ''[[Clitocybe]].''\n\n=== Psychotropics ===\n[[File:Psilocybe semilanceata.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is hunted for its psychotropic properties.]]\n{{details|Psilocybin mushrooms}}\nThe ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'''s [[psychotropic]] properties have been traditionally used by shamans in [[Siberia]] in their rituals. However, its use for such purposes today is very rare, despite the mushroom's abundance. Instead, the ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' is sought after for its hallucinogenic properties, the latter being more desirable with fewer side effects than those of ''A. muscaria''. The use of ''P. semilanceata'' is however significantly hindered by its small size, requiring larger quantities and being hard to spot. Other Psilocybe species are abundant in the American south and west, as well as Mexico, where they have been used by traditional shamans for centuries. In the west, one can often find mushroom pickers in cow pastures in a stereotypical stoop looking in the grass for psilocybes. This can be quite dangerous, as many species grow in pastures and amateurs often misidentify psilocybes.\n* ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' (\u041c\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0440 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 [Mukhomor Krasniy] - Red Fly-Killer; ''Fly Agaric, Toadstool'')\n* ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' (\u041f\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0431\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0447\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f [Psilotsiba Sosochkovidnaya] - Nipple-Like Psylocybe; ''Liberty Cap'')\n{{clear}}\n\n== Regional importance ==\n[[File:Mashrooms on varena roadside.jpg|thumb|Locals are selling mushrooms and berries collected in the [[Dainava Forest]], [[Lithuania]]]]\n[[File:Market Mushrooms.JPG|thumb|250px|Forest-picked mushrooms at a Ukrainian market in [[Kolomyia]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n*In the United States mushroom picking is popular in the Appalachian area and on the west coast from San Francisco Bay northward, in northern [[California]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and in many other regions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n*British enthusiasts today enjoy an extended average picking season of 75 days compared to just 33 in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gange |first=A.

After a heavy rain during the mushroom season whole families often venture into the nearest forest, picking bucketfuls of mushrooms, which are cooked and eaten for dinner upon return (most often in omelettes with eggs or fried in butter) or alternatively dried or [[marination|marinated]] for later consumption.\n\n=== Festivals ===\nThe popularity of mushroom picking in some parts of the world has led to mushroom festivals. The festivals are usually between September and October, depending on the mushrooms available in a particular region. Festivals in North America include:\n*Bamfield, British Columbia \u2014 Bamfield Fungus Festival\n*[[Berwyn, Illinois|Berwyn]], Illinois - Houby Festival\n*Boyne City, Michigan\u2014Annual National Morel Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.morelfest.com/|title=National Morel Mushroom Festival - Official site for the Mushroom Festival held each May in Boyne City, Michigan|website=www.morelfest.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* Buena Vista, Colorado\u2014Buena Vista Heritage's Mushroom Festival\n*Washington's Long Beach Peninsula\u2014Wild Mushroom Celebration\n*Lake Quinault Lodge in Washington's Olympic National Forest\u2014Quinault Rain Forest Mushroom Festival\n*Mendocino County (North of San Francisco)--Mushroom Festival\n*Madisonville, Texas\u2014Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasmushroomfestival.com/|title=Texas Mushroom festival|website=www.texasmushroomfestival.com|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]], Colorado\u2014Telluride Mushroom Festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telluridemushroomfest.org/|title=Telluride Mushroom Festival - Mushroom Hunting - Mushroom Expert|website=Telluride Mushroom Fest|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n*Kennett Square, Pennsylvania\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*Girdwood, Alaska\u2014Fungus Fair\n*Muscoda, Wisconsin\u2014Morel Mushroom Festival\n*Eugene, Oregon\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*Richmond, Missouri\u2014Mushroom Festival\n*New Plymouth, Taranaki, New Zealand-Mushroom Ball\n*Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Czech Village-Houby Days Festival\n\n=== Radiation ===\n[[Nuclear fallout]] from the [[Chernobyl disaster]] is an important issue concerning mushroom picking in Europe. Due to the wide spread of their [[mycelium]], mushrooms tend to accumulate more radioactive [[caesium-137]] than surrounding soil and other organisms. State agencies (e.g. [[Bellesrad]] in Belarus) monitor and analyze the degree of [[radionuclide]] accumulation in various wild species of plants and animals. In particular, Bellesrad claims that Svinushka (''[[Paxillus]]'' ssp.), Maslenok (''[[Suillus]]'' ssp.), Mokhovik (''[[Xerocomus]]'' ssp.), and Horkushka (''[[Lactarius rufus]]'') are the worst ones in this respect. The safest one is Opyonok Osyenniy (''[[Armillaria mellea]]''). This is an issue not only in [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]: the fallout also reached western Europe, and until recently the German government discouraged people gathering certain mushrooms.\n\nThe situation is treated with black humor in some [[Russian jokes#Chernobyl|Russian jokes]].''\n\n== Guidelines for mushroom picking ==\n\n=== Poisonous mushrooms commonly confused with edible ones ===\n{{See also|Mushroom poisoning#Poisonous species|List of deadly fungi}}\nMany mushroom guidebooks call attention to similarities between species, especially significant if an edible species is similar to, or commonly confused with, one that is potentially harmful.\n\nExamples:\n* False chanterelles (''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]''), as the name suggests, can look like real chanterelles (''[[Cantharellus]] cibarius'') to the inexperienced eye. The latter do not have sharp gills, but rather blunt veins on the underside.  Misidentification in this case is not likely to prove significantly dangerous, as false chanterelles are considered edible, but unpleasant tasting. Mild symptoms have been reported from consuming them.<ref>Arora, David.  Mushrooms Demystified.  Ten Speed Press, 1986</ref> Conversely, the [[Jack O'Lantern mushroom]] is often mistaken for a chanterelle, and it is potently toxic.\n* True morels are distinguished from [[false morel]]s (''[[Gyromitra|Gyromitra spp.]]'' and ''[[Verpa|Verpa spp.]]''). False morels have caps attached at the top of the stalk, while true morels have a honeycombed cap and a single, continuous hollow chamber within.\n* Immature ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' can be confused with edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' and ''[[Macrolepiota]]'' mushrooms.\n* Immature [[puffball]]s are generally edible, but care must be taken to avoid species such as ''[[Scleroderma citrinum]]'' and immature ''[[Amanita]]''s. These can be identified by cutting a puffball in half and looking for a dark reticulated [[gleba]] or the articulated, nonhomogeneous structures of a gilled mushroom, respectively.\n* Highly poisonous ''[[Conocybe filaris]]'' and some ''[[Galerina]]'' species can resemble ''[[Psilocybe]]'', and the species are observed growing alongside each other. Psilocybe species are not deadly but contain the alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin, known to cause hallucinogenic effects; therefore it is often sought for use as a recreational psychedelic drug.\n\n=== Eating poisonous species ===\nThere are treatments to reduce or eliminate the toxicity of certain (but not all) poisonous species to the point where they may be edible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamrubel.com/wild-mushrooms/amanita-muscaria/|title=Amanita muscaria, edibile if parboiled|date=30 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> For instance, [[false morel]]s are deadly poisonous when eaten raw or incorrectly prepared, but their toxins can be reduced by a proper method of parboiling. Prepared in this way, this mushroom is widely used and considered a delicacy in many European countries, although recent research suggests that there may still be long-term health consequences from eating it.<ref>[http://www.namyco.org/images/pdf_files/Poisonings30year.pdf Michael W.

While being a general mushroom hunting guideline, the avoidance of specimens growing in areas with high [[pollution]] is especially important with this family, as it is a very effective pollutant absorber.\n* ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]'' (parasol mushroom)\n\n=== Amanitaceae ===\nWhile the family of amanitas are approached with extreme caution, as it contains the lethal ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' and ''[[Amanita virosa]]'', those confident in their skills often pick the ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'', which is highly prized in [[Europe]] and to a much lesser extent in Russia, accounted by some not to superior taste, but to its relation to the ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'', which is not found in Russia, but was considered a delicacy worthy of the emperor in [[Ancient Rome]].\n* ''[[Amanita rubescens]]'' (European blusher)\n* ''[[Amanita caesarea]]'' (Caesar's mushroom)\n\n=== Boletaceae ===\n\n[[File:Cep in basket 2006 G01.jpg|thumb|right|A collection of ''[[Boletus edulis]]'']]\n\nThis order is often viewed as the order of \"noble\" mushrooms, containing few poisonous species, identifiable with relative ease, and having superior palatability. The most notable species is the ''[[Boletus edulis]]'', the \"mushroom king\", an almost legendary, relatively rare mushroom, edible in almost any (even raw) form, and commonly considered ''the'' best-tasting mushroom.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (It is common to confuse the Russian name, literally \"white mushroom\", with [[champignon]]s, often known in English as \"white mushrooms\".)\n* ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' (''H\u0159ib Smrkov\u00fd, Dub\u00e1k, Borowik szlachetny, Porcino, King Bolete, Cep, Steinpilz'')\n\nThe genus ''Leccinum'' includes two well-known mushroom species named after the trees they can usually be found next to. The ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (as well as the ''[[Leccinum versipelle]]''), found under [[aspen]] trees, and the ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (as well as the ''[[L. holopus]]''), found under [[birch]] trees. The secondary mentioned species, are significantly different in cap colour only. Both types are very sought after, being highly palatable, while more common than the B. edulis.\n* ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]'' (red-capped scaber stalk)\n* ''[[Leccinum scabrum]]'' (birch bolete)\n\nThe genus ''[[Suillus]]'', characterised by its slimy cap, is another prized mushroom, the ''[[Suillus luteus]]'' and ''[[Suillus granulatus]]'' being its most common varieties, and while abundant in some parts of Eurasia, is a rare occurrence in others. It is easy to identify and very palatable.\n* ''[[Suillus]]'' (klouzek, slippery Jack, butter mushroom)\n\nThe genus ''[[Xerocomus]]'' is generally considered a less desirable (though mostly edible) mushroom group, due to common abundant [[mould]] growth on their caps, which can make them poisonous. The ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'', however is an exception, being moderately sought after, especially in Europe. Some scientific classifications now consider species in the genus ''Xerocomus'' as members of ''Boletus''.\n* ''[[Xerocomus]]'' (mossiness mushroom)\n* ''[[Boletus badius|Xerocomus badius]]'' (''h\u0159ib hn\u011bd\u00fd'')\n\n=== Cantharellaceae ===\n\n[[File:--GFDL--Voveraite.JPG|thumb|right|[[Chanterelle]]s]]\n\nThe ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'', a common and popular mushroom, especially in Europe, is a choice edible and unique mushroom. It is very rarely infested by [[worm]]s or [[larva]]e, has a unique appearance, and when rotting, the decomposed parts are easily distinguishable and separable from those that are edible.\n* ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (chanterelle, yellow chanterelle, pfifferling)\n\n=== Helvellaceae ===\n\nThe ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' is considered poisonous, but can be consumed if dried and stored for over a year, according to Slavic literature, and can be used to supplement or replace [[morel]] (see ''Morchellaceae'' below) mushrooms, while Western literature claims that even the fumes of the mushroom are dangerous. It is similar to morels both in appearance and palatability.\n* ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' (false morel, beefsteak morel, lorchel)\n\n=== Morchellaceae ===\n\n[[File:Mushroom Magic Meal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A basket of [[Morchella|morels]]]]\n\nThe morel, ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' is highly prized in Western Europe, India and North America. It is significantly less prized in Slavic countries where, like the ''Gyromitra esculenta'', it is considered marginally edible with mediocre palatability. Boiling the mushroom and discarding the water is often recommended.\n* ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'' (morel, yellow morel)\n\n=== Lactarius ===\n\nMembers of the genus ''[[Lactarius]]'', as the name suggests, lactate a milky liquid when wounded and are often scoffed upon by Western literature. The ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' is however regarded as one of the most palatable mushrooms in Slavic culture, comparable to the ''Boletus edulis''. Also considered as similarly palatable are the species ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' and particularly ''[[Lactarius resimus]]''. Thermal treatment may however be necessary in some cases. Slightly less appealing due to its bitter taste is the ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]''.\n* ''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'' (saffron milk-cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius resimus]]'' (pepper cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius necator]]'' (black pepper cap)\n* ''[[Lactarius pubescens]]'' (wooly milk-cap)\n\n=== Russulaceae ===\n\nThe [[Russula]] family includes over 750 species and is one of the most common and abundant mushrooms in Eurasia.  Their cap colours include red, brown, yellow, blue and green and can be easily spotted. The ''[[Russula vesca]]'' species, one of the many red-capped varieties, is one of the most common, is reasonably palatable and can be eaten raw.  The edible Russulas have a mild taste, compared to many inedible or poisonous species that have a strong hot or bitter taste - but notice that the deadly poisonous Amanita phalloides, Amanita virosa and many other poisonous mushrooms have mild taste! The ''[[Russula emetica]]'' (the sickener) is known to cause gastrointestinal upset and has a very hot taste when a small bit is placed on the tongue.  Due to their abundance they are however often regarded as an inferior mushroom for hunting, since they may be eaten if [[parboiled]].\n* ''[[Russula vesca]]'' (Russula)\n\n=== Tricholomataceae ===\n\n* ''[[Armillaria]]'' (honey mushroom, shoestring rot). The genus ''[[Armillaria]]'', with the popular species ''A. gallica'' and ''A. mellea'', being so similar that they are rarely differentiated, are palatable, highly abundant mushrooms. Generally found on decaying [[tree stump]]s, they grow in very large quantities and are easy to spot and identify, arguably reducing the fun and challenge in mushroom hunting.\n* ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'' (oyster mushroom). It is the most commonly picked tree-dwelling mushroom and is often also artificially cultivated for sale in grocery stores. This sturdy mushroom can be quite palatable when young. Growing these mushrooms at home can be a profitable enterprise and some Russians engage in the activity.\n\n[[Image:matsutakeredpinemushroomhunting.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Matsutake]]'', the highly sought-after pine mushroom, found in [[coniferous]] forests in [[Hiroshima]] in autumn]]\n\n*''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]'' - = syn. ''T. nauseosum'', the rare red pine mushroom that has a very fine aroma. Its fragrance is both sweet and spicy. They grow under trees and are usually concealed under fallen leaves and the duff layer. It forms a symbiotic relationship with the roots of a limited number of tree species. In Japan it is most commonly associated with Japanese red pine. However, in the Pacific Northwest it is found in coniferous forests of [[Douglas fir]], [[noble fir]], [[sugar pine]], and [[Ponderosa pine]]. Farther south, it is also associated with hardwoods, namely [[tanoak]] and [[madrone]] forests. The Pacific Northwest and other similar temperate regions along the Pacific Rim also hold great habitat producing these and other quality wild mushrooms. In 1999, N. Bergius and E. Danell reported that Swedish (''Tricholoma nauseosum'') and Japanese matsutake (''T. matsutake'') are the same species. The report caused the increased import from Northern Europe to Japan because of the comparable flavor and taste. Matsutake are difficult to find and are therefore very expensive. Moreover, domestic productions of Matsutake in Japan have been sharply reduced over the last fifty years due to a pine [[nematode]] ''[[Bursaphelenchus xylophilus]]'', and it has influenced the price a great deal. The annual harvest of matsutake in Japan has since further decreased. The price for matsutake in the Japanese market is highly dependent on quality, availability and origin. The Japanese matsutake at the beginning of the season, which is the highest grade, can go up to $2000 per kilogram, while the average value for imported matsutake from China, Europe, and the United States is only about $90 per kilogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2368|title=Finding and Preparing The Elusive Matsutake Mushroom|publisher=|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n* The ''[[Tricholoma magnivelare]]'' is a prized mushroom in North America.

Despite the variety of bries, the French government officially certifies only two types of cheese to be sold under that name: ''[[Brie de Meaux]]'' and ''[[Brie de Melun]]''.\n\n=== Brie de Meaux ===\nBrie de Meaux is an unpasteurized brie, with an average weight of {{convert|2.8|kg|abbr=on}} for a diameter of {{convert|36|to|37|cm|abbr=on}}. Manufactured in the town of [[Meaux]] in the Brie region of northern France since the 8th century, it was originally known as the \"Queen's Cheese\", or, after the [[French Revolution]], the \"Queen of Cheeses,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and was enjoyed by the peasantry and nobility alike. It was granted the protection of ''[[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) status in 1980, and it is produced primarily in the eastern part of the Parisian basin.\n\n=== Brie de Melun ===\n[[File:Wikicheese - Brie de Melun - 20150515 - 015.jpg|thumb|235px|''Brie de Melun'']]\nBrie de Melun has an average weight of {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} and a diameter of {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |title = Dairy Foods Consulting & Westminster Artisan Cheesemaking |last = Dixon |first = Peter |accessdate = 25 July 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227173810/http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |archivedate = 27 December 2013 }}</ref> It is therefore smaller than Brie de Meaux but is considered to have a stronger flavor and more pungent smell.

This softness allows for the rapid widespread growth of bacteria if the cheese is not stored correctly. It is recommended that brie cheese be refrigerated immediately after purchase, and stored in the refrigerator until it is consumed completely.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/cheese/brie-feta-mozzarella-soft-cheese-shelf-life-expiration-date/|title=How Long Does Soft Cheese Last?

The cheese should be kept in a tightly sealed container or plastic wrap to avoid contact with moisture and food-spoilage bacteria which will reduce the shelf life and freshness of the product.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\" /> The companies that produce this cheese usually recommend that their cheese be consumed before the best-before date and no later than a week after. Although the cheese can still be consumed at this time, the quality of the cheese is believed to be reduced substantially. In the case that blue or green mould appears to be growing on the cheese, it must no longer be consumed and must be discarded immediately so that food-borne illness is prevented. The mold should not be cut off to continue consumption as there is a high risk of the mold's spores being  already spread throughout the entire cheese.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\" />\n\n== Comparison with Camembert ==\n[[Camembert]] is a similar soft cheese that is also made from cow's milk. Camembert is a much more recently developed cheese, and is based on brie.  However, there are differences such as its origin, typical market shape, size, and flavour. Brie originates from the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] while Camembert comes from [[Normandy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-brie-and-camembert-word-of-mouth-215948|title=What's the Difference Between Brie and Camembert?|last=Foster|first=Kelli|date=February 24, 2015|work=The Kitchn|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref> Traditionally, brie was produced in large wheels, 23 to 37&nbsp;cm (9 to 14.5 in) in diameter, and thus ripened more slowly than the smaller Camembert cheeses. When sold, brie segments typically have been cut from the larger wheels (although some brie is sold as small, flat cylinders), and therefore its sides are not covered by the rind. By contrast, Camembert is ripened as a small round cheese 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in diameter by about 3&nbsp;cm (1.25&nbsp;in) thick and fully covered by rind. This ratio change between rind and paste makes Camembert slightly stronger when compared to a brie ripened for the same amount of time. Once the rind is cut on Camembert, the cheese typically has a more pungent aroma than does brie. In terms of taste, Camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky taste. The texture of Camembert is softer than that of brie, and if warmed, Camembert will become creamier, whereas brie warms without losing as much structure.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|France}}\n*[[Neufchatel cheese]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{French cheeses}}\n\n[[Category:French cheeses]]\n[[Category:French products with protected designation of origin]]\n[[Category:Cow's-milk cheeses]]\n[[Category:Smoked cheeses]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the cheese|the region of France for which the cheese is named|Brie (region)|other uses|Brie (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox cheese\n| regiontown = [[Seine-et-Marne]]\n| source = [[Cow]]s\n| pasteurized = By law in the [[United States|US]] and [[Australia]], not in most of [[Europe]]\n| texture = Soft-ripened\n| aging = Generally 5 to 6 weeks\n| certification = [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]], 1980, for both Brie de Meaux and Brie de Melun\n}}\n\n'''Brie''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|i\u02d0}}; {{IPA-fr|b\u0281i|lang}}) is a soft cow's-milk [[cheese]] named after [[Brie (region)|Brie]], the [[France|French]] region from which it originated (roughly corresponding to the modern ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Seine-et-Marne]]).

Around the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] where brie is made, people enjoy soaking this in ''[[caf\u00e9 au lait]]'' and eating it for breakfast.<ref>{{cite book |last= Masui |first= T. |author2=Tomoko, Y.|author3=Hodgson, R.|author4=Robuchon, J. |title= French Cheeses |publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley|DK]] |year= 2004 |isbn= 1-4053-0666-1}}</ref>\n\nOverripe brie contains an unpleasant excessive amount of ammonia, produced by the same [[microorganism]]s required for ripening.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Harold |title=On Food and Cooking: The Science and Lore of the Kitchen |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=2004 |isbn=0-684-80001-2 }}</ref>\n\nSome versions of brie cheese are [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NDcVs0S42qMC&pg=PA17 The New Irish Table: 70 Contemporary Recipes \u2013 Margaret M.

Indeed, although brie is a French cheese, it is possible to obtain [[Somerset]] and [[Wisconsin]] brie. Despite the variety of bries, the French government officially certifies only two types of cheese to be sold under that name: ''[[Brie de Meaux]]'' and ''[[Brie de Melun]]''.\n\n=== Brie de Meaux ===\nBrie de Meaux is an unpasteurized brie, with an average weight of {{convert|2.8|kg|abbr=on}} for a diameter of {{convert|36|to|37|cm|abbr=on}}. Manufactured in the town of [[Meaux]] in the Brie region of northern France since the 8th century, it was originally known as the \"Queen's Cheese\", or, after the [[French Revolution]], the \"Queen of Cheeses,\"<ref name=\":0\" /> and was enjoyed by the peasantry and nobility alike. It was granted the protection of ''[[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) status in 1980, and it is produced primarily in the eastern part of the Parisian basin.\n\n=== Brie de Melun ===\n[[File:Wikicheese - Brie de Melun - 20150515 - 015.jpg|thumb|235px|''Brie de Melun'']]\nBrie de Melun has an average weight of {{convert|1.5|kg|lb}} and a diameter of {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |title = Dairy Foods Consulting & Westminster Artisan Cheesemaking |last = Dixon |first = Peter |accessdate = 25 July 2013 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131227173810/http://www.dairyfoodsconsulting.com/recipes_camembert.shtml |archivedate = 27 December 2013 }}</ref> It is therefore smaller than Brie de Meaux but is considered to have a stronger flavor and more pungent smell. It is made with unpasteurized milk. Brie de Melun is also available in the form of \"Old Brie\" or black brie.  It was granted the protection of AOC status in 1980.\n\n=== French non-AOC bries ===\nThe following French bries do not have AOC certification:\nBrie de Montereau, \u00cele-de-France, Brie de Nangis, Brie de Provins, Brie noir, Brie fermier, Brie d'Isigny, Brie de Melun bleu, Brie petit moul\u00e9, Brie laitier [[Coulommiers cheese|Coulommiers]].\n\n=== International bries ===\n'''Australia'''\nKing Island Dairy, on [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]] between Victoria and Tasmania, produces a range of cheeses sold as \"brie\",<ref>King Island Dairy [http://www.kingislanddairy.com.au/product_type/soft-white/ King Island Dairy \u2013 Soft White] Retrieved March 8, 2015</ref> as does Jindi Cheese in Victoria and High Valley Mudgee Cheese Co in Mudgee, NSW.<ref>Jindi Cheese website [http://www.jindi.com.au/white.html Jindi Cheese : White Cheese Range] Retrieved March 8, 2015</ref>\n\n'''UK'''\n[[Cornish Brie]]; [[Somerset Brie]]; Baron Bigod (made in Suffolk); Cenarth Brie (made in Wales); Clava Brie<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://taste-of-scotland.com/scottish-cheese-and-cheese-makers/|title=Scottish Cheese and Cheese Makers|website=Taste of Scotland|access-date=2018-04-13}}</ref> (made in Scotland).\n\n'''US'''\nThe [[Marin French Cheese Company]] in California has made an unaged cheese since 1865 described as \"fresh brie\".\n\n'''Brazil'''\nBrazilian \"brie\" is made in the dairy region located in the Southern area of Minas Gerais state (bordering S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states) and Southeast Minas Gerais (bordering Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito Santo states).\n\n'''Ireland'''\nIreland produces various \"brie\" cheeses such as Wicklow B\u00e1n Brie<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/regionals/wicklowpeople/news/wicklow-cheese-is-the-best-in-ireland-37354180.html|title=Wicklow cheese is the best in Ireland!|website=Independent|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, St. Killian Brie<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/food-drink/food-reviews/taste-test-irish-brie-and-camembert-36240291.html|title=Taste test: Irish Brie and Camembert|website=Independent|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and The Little Milk Company's Organic Irish Brie<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelittlemilkcompany.ie/products/organic-irish-brie|title=Organic Irish Brie|website=The Little Milk Company|access-date=2019-03-22}}</ref>.\n\n== Serving ==\nBrie is usually purchased either in a full [[wheel]] or as a wheel segment.<ref>{{cite book |last= Androu\u00ebt |first= P. |title= Le brie |publisher= [[Presses du Village]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 978-88-15-06225-3}}</ref> The white outside of the cheese is completely edible, and many eat brie whole.<ref>{{cite book |last= Ben\u00eat |first= J. |title= Histoire du fromage de Langres |publisher= [[Broch\u00e9]] |year= 2005 |isbn= 978-2-87825-332-0}}</ref> If the outside is firm and the inside is slightly bouncy and resilient, it is ready to serve. Underripe Brie may be stiff to the touch. Meanwhile, overripe Brie may be creamier and almost runny.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://presidentcheese.com/news/how-to-eat-brie|title=How To Eat Brie Just Like The French Do|last=solve|date=2018-02-20|website=Pr\u00e9sident\u00ae|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref> The cheese is sometimes served slightly melted or baked, in a round, lidded [[ceramic]] dish, and topped with nuts or fruit, or both.\n\n== Storage ==\nBrie cheese, like Camembert and Cirrus, is considered a soft cheese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cheese.com/by_type/?page=2&per_page=60&t=soft#top|title=Cheeses by texture \u2013 Cheese.com|work=cheese.com}}</ref> This particular type of cheese is very rich and creamy, unlike [[Cheddar cheese|Cheddar]].  This softness allows for the rapid widespread growth of bacteria if the cheese is not stored correctly. It is recommended that brie cheese be refrigerated immediately after purchase, and stored in the refrigerator until it is consumed completely.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eatbydate.com/dairy/cheese/brie-feta-mozzarella-soft-cheese-shelf-life-expiration-date/|title=How Long Does Soft Cheese Last? Shelf Life, Storage, Expiry|work=Eat By Date}}</ref> The optimal storage temperature for brie is {{convert|4|\u00b0C}} or even lower. The cheese should be kept in a tightly sealed container or plastic wrap to avoid contact with moisture and food-spoilage bacteria which will reduce the shelf life and freshness of the product.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\" /> The companies that produce this cheese usually recommend that their cheese be consumed before the best-before date and no later than a week after. Although the cheese can still be consumed at this time, the quality of the cheese is believed to be reduced substantially. In the case that blue or green mould appears to be growing on the cheese, it must no longer be consumed and must be discarded immediately so that food-borne illness is prevented. The mold should not be cut off to continue consumption as there is a high risk of the mold's spores being  already spread throughout the entire cheese.<ref name=\"eatbydate.com\" />\n\n== Comparison with Camembert ==\n[[Camembert]] is a similar soft cheese that is also made from cow's milk. Camembert is a much more recently developed cheese, and is based on brie.  However, there are differences such as its origin, typical market shape, size, and flavour. Brie originates from the [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] while Camembert comes from [[Normandy]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thekitchn.com/whats-the-difference-between-brie-and-camembert-word-of-mouth-215948|title=What's the Difference Between Brie and Camembert?|last=Foster|first=Kelli|date=February 24, 2015|work=The Kitchn|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref> Traditionally, brie was produced in large wheels, 23 to 37&nbsp;cm (9 to 14.5 in) in diameter, and thus ripened more slowly than the smaller Camembert cheeses. When sold, brie segments typically have been cut from the larger wheels (although some brie is sold as small, flat cylinders), and therefore its sides are not covered by the rind. By contrast, Camembert is ripened as a small round cheese 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in diameter by about 3&nbsp;cm (1.25&nbsp;in) thick and fully covered by rind. This ratio change between rind and paste makes Camembert slightly stronger when compared to a brie ripened for the same amount of time. Once the rind is cut on Camembert, the cheese typically has a more pungent aroma than does brie. In terms of taste, Camembert has a stronger, slightly sour, and sometimes chalky taste. The texture of Camembert is softer than that of brie, and if warmed, Camembert will become creamier, whereas brie warms without losing as much structure.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Food|France}}\n*[[Neufchatel cheese]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{French cheeses}}\n\n[[Category:French cheeses]]\n[[Category:French products with protected designation of origin]]\n[[Category:Cow's-milk cheeses]]\n[[Category:Smoked cheeses]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie"}
