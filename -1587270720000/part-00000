He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

The large lead is OK given the content in the article and Wikipedia's MOS:INTRO policy.-->\n\nBorn and raised in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York, Schultz graduated from [[Northern Michigan University]] in 1975. After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three business books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]] and moderate political views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join the last contest because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, marriage equality, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies and introduced a national [[loyalty program]]. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nSchultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|145th-richest person in the United States]] by ''Forbes'' in 2019 with a [[net worth]] of $4.1 billion (November 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|access-date=April 2, 2019|language=en}}</ref> He is the author of [[Howard Schultz#Books|three business books]], ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|centrist]] and moderate political views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join the last contest because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports nonpartisan immigration policy, [[free trade]], [[Balanced budget|fiscal discipline]], comprehensive tax reform, gun control, marriage equality, and more generally, [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum. To further his philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.

It is formed by extending the [[index finger|index]] and [[little finger]]s while holding the [[middle finger|middle]] and [[ring finger]]s down with the [[thumb]].\n\n==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the \"[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/|title=Is Rajinikanth\u2019s party symbol the same as Apana Mudra for \u2018detoxification and purification\u2019?|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> In [[Indian classical dance]] forms the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>. In [[Buddhism]] it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as \"Karana Mudra\" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the \"[[evil eye]]\" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.{{cn|date=January 2020}} \n\nIn Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also \"touch iron\" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.\n\nIn [[Peru]] one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]] the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fuk\u00fa''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.\n\nThe sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned god]].<ref>''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Offensive gesture==\nIn many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world/|title=Rude hand gestures of the world (don't try these on holiday)|date=February 4, 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html|title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}</ref> when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning \"horned\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two \u2014 The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}</ref> During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of [[Josep Piqu\u00e9]], the Spanish foreign minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n\n==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==\n\n===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===\nThe 1969 back album cover for ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls]]'' on Mercury Records by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], led by singer [[Jinx Dawson]], pictured Coven band members giving the \"sign of the horns\".

Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed \"[[Paul is dead]]\" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for \"I love you\"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.\n\nThe sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the 1971 British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap leading a procession of outlandish looking figures, flashes the sign.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the \"P-Funk sign\" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.<ref>Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.</ref> The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name \"maloik\", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Geezer Butler|Terry \"Geezer\" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen \"raising the horns\" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970\u20131978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the \"horns\" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.\n\nWhen asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:\n\n{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was \u2026 I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the \"Malocchio\". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it.

It is formed by extending the [[index finger|index]] and [[little finger]]s while holding the [[middle finger|middle]] and [[ring finger]]s down with the [[thumb]].\n\n==Spiritual and superstitious meaning==\n\nIn [[Hinduism]], the hand gesture is known as the \"[[List of mudras (yoga)#Hasta (hand mudras)|Apana yogic mudra]]\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rajinikanth-politics-party-symbol-apana-mudra-detoxification-purification-5007863/|title=Is Rajinikanth\u2019s party symbol the same as Apana Mudra for \u2018detoxification and purification\u2019?|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> In [[Indian classical dance]] forms the hand gesture symbolises the [[Asiatic lion#In mythology, religion, culture and art|Lion]]<ref name=\"auto\"/>. In [[Buddhism]] it is seen as an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] gesture very commonly used by [[Gautama Buddha]] as \"Karana Mudra\" which is synonymous with [[Exorcism#Buddhism|expulsion of demons]] and removal of obstacles like sickness or negative thoughts.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe [[apotropaic]] usage of the sign can also be seen in [[Italy]] and in other [[Mediterranean]] cultures where, when confronted with unfortunate events, or simply when these events are mentioned, the sign of the horns may be given to ward off bad luck. It is also used traditionally to counter or ward off the \"[[evil eye]]\" (''malocchio'' in Italian). In Italy specifically, the gesture is known as the ''corna''. With fingers pointing down, it is a common Mediterranean apotropaic gesture, by which people seek protection in unlucky situations (it is thus a more Mediterranean equivalent of [[knocking on wood]]). Thus, for example, the [[President of the Italian Republic]], [[Giovanni Leone]], shocked the country when, while in [[Naples]] during an [[outbreak]] of [[cholera]], he shook the hands of [[patient]]s with one hand while with the other behind his back he superstitiously made the ''corna'', presumably to ward off the disease or in reaction to being confronted by such misfortune. This act was well documented by the [[journalist]]s and [[photographer]]s who were right behind him, a fact that had escaped President Leone's mind in that moment.{{cn|date=January 2020}} \n\nIn Italy and other parts of the [[Mediterranean region]], the gesture must usually be performed with the fingers tilting downward to signify the warding off of bad luck; in the same region and elsewhere, the gesture may take a different, offensive and insulting meaning if it is performed with fingers upward or if directed aggressively towards someone in a swiveling motion (see section below). In Italy, one can also \"touch iron\" (''tocca ferro'') or touch one's nose to ward off bad luck. Males in Italy may also grab their [[testicle]]s when confronted by bad luck; however, this is considered more vulgar.\n\nIn [[Peru]] one says ''contra'' (against). In the [[Dominican Republic]] the expression is ''zafa'', said against curses known as ''fuk\u00fa''. All of these gestures are meant to conjure supernatural protection.\n\nThe sign of the horns is used during religious rituals in Wicca, to invoke or represent the [[Horned god]].<ref>''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'' by Scott Cunningham, p. 42.</ref>\n\n==Offensive gesture==\nIn many [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] and Latin countries, such as [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/galleries/Rude-hand-gestures-of-the-world/|title=Rude hand gestures of the world (don't try these on holiday)|date=February 4, 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |title=International field guide to rude hand gestures |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214213945/http://www.theloop.ca/living/funwind/photo-gallery/-/p/6407/-International-field-guide-to-rude-hand-gestures/2442503 |archivedate=2013-12-14 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hand-gestures-in-different-cultures.html|title=Hand Gestures in Different Cultures}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rHS39OG4GG4C |title=Rude Hand Gestures of the World: A Guide to Offending without Words By Romana Lefevre |isbn=9781452110172 |author1=Lefevre |first1=Romana |date=2011-10-21 }}</ref> when directed towards someone and swiveled back and forth, the sign implies [[cuckold]]ry; the common words for ''cuckolded'' in Italian, Greek and Spanish are {{lang|it|cornuto}}, {{lang|el|\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03c2}} ({{lang|el-Latn|keratas}}) and {{lang|es|cornudo}}, respectively, literally meaning \"horned\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reading-body-language.co.uk/gestures2.html |title=Hand Gestures Part Two \u2014 The Cuckold Gesture |publisher=Reading-Body-Language.co.uk}}</ref> During a [[European Union]] meeting in February 2002, then-current Italian prime minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]] was photographed performing this gesture behind the back of [[Josep Piqu\u00e9]], the Spanish foreign minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874139,00.html|title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes|date=8 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2017|via=content.time.com}}</ref>\n\n==Northwestern European and North American popular culture==\n\n===Contemporary use by musicians and fans===\nThe 1969 back album cover for ''[[Witchcraft Destroys Minds & Reaps Souls]]'' on Mercury Records by Chicago-based psychedelic-occult rock band [[Coven (band)|Coven]], led by singer [[Jinx Dawson]], pictured Coven band members giving the \"sign of the horns\".

Some fans interpreted this as one of the many supposed \"[[Paul is dead]]\" clues. Some may think it is possible that the cartoonist misrepresented the [[ILY sign|sign for \"I love you\"]], which is very similar and more in keeping with the band's public message and image. However, the 1969 cartoon is based on many photos of John Lennon making the hand sign in 1967. One of these photos of Lennon doing the hand sign appears on the cover of a Beatles single release shortly after, making it the first time the hand sign appears on a rock release.\n\nThe sign is also used in various Disney movies. It can be seen in the medieval-style opening sequence of the 1971 British-American Disney movie ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'' as a goat-legged figure with a jester's cap leading a procession of outlandish looking figures, flashes the sign.\n\nBeginning in the early 1970s, the horns were known as the \"P-Funk sign\" to fans of [[Parliament-Funkadelic]].

One of his most famous lines is, \" Don't mess with the bull young man, you'll get the horns\", flashing the sign of the horns while rotating his wrist.\n\nIn one episode of the popular animated series [[The Simpsons]], a female tramp is seen warding off a male tramp using the sign of the horns using her thumbs and index fingers, screaming 'And you're a three-headed devil dog!

Dio began using the sign soon after joining the metal band [[Black Sabbath]] in 1979. The previous singer in the band, [[Ozzy Osbourne]], was rather well known for using the [[V Sign|\"peace\"]] sign at concerts, raising the index and middle finger in the form of a V. Dio, in an attempt to connect with the fans, wanted to similarly use a hand gesture. However, not wanting to copy Osbourne, he chose to use the sign his grandmother always made.<ref>Ronnie James Dio interview in the 2005 documentary ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''. In the interview he also ridicules Gene Simmons for taking credit for originating use of the sign in heavy metal, attributing the claim to Simmons' well-known egotism.</ref> The horns became famous in metal concerts very soon after Black Sabbath's first tour with Dio. The sign would later be appropriated by heavy metal fans under the name \"maloik\", a corruption of the original ''malocchio''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n[[Geezer Butler|Terry \"Geezer\" Butler]] of Black Sabbath can be seen \"raising the horns\" in a photograph taken in 1971. The photograph is included in the CD booklet of the ''[[Symptom of the Universe: The Original Black Sabbath 1970\u20131978]]'' compilation album. This would indicate that there had been some association between the \"horns\" and heavy metal before Dio's popularization of it.\n\nWhen asked if he was the one who introduced the hand gesture to metal subculture, Dio said in a 2001 interview with Metal-Rules.com:\n\n{{quote|I doubt very much if I would be the first one who ever did that. That's like saying I invented the wheel, I'm sure someone did that at some other point. I think you'd have to say that I made it fashionable. I used it so much and all the time and it had become my trademark until the [[Britney Spears]] audience decided to do it as well. So it kind of lost its meaning with that. But it was \u2026 I was in Sabbath at the time. It was a symbol that I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about. It's NOT the devil's sign like we're here with the devil. It's an Italian thing I got from my Grandmother called the \"Malocchio\". It's to ward off the Evil Eye or to give the Evil Eye, depending on which way you do it. It's just a symbol but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it and I felt it worked very well with Sabbath. So I became very noted for it and then everybody else started to pick up on it and away it went. But I would never say I take credit for being the first to do it. I say because I did it so much that it became the symbol of rock and roll of some kind.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/zine/index.php?option=content&task=view&id=666 |title=Dio - Interviewed By EvilG |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=March 9, 2001}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Gene Simmons]] of the rock group [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] attempted to claim the \"devil horns\" hand gesture for his own.
