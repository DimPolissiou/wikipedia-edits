The husband-wife team became highly demanded as speakers on the negative impacts of sex role stereotypes on individuals and society. At the time, there was a lack of empirical evidence to support their assertions because this was uncharted territory, and so Sandra Bem became very interested and determined to gather data that would support the detrimental and limiting effects of traditional sex roles.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In her early career, she was heavily involved in [[women's liberation movement]], and she did work on sex-biased job advertising. Her involvement led to being a contributor to landmark cases concerning recruitment of women in the work force against companies such as AT&T and the Pittsburgh Press.<ref name=\"Ove\" />\n\nEarly on in Bem's career she created the [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] (BSRI), which is an inventory that acknowledges that individuals may exhibit both male and female characteristics.<ref name=\"George\">[http://www.feministvoices.com/sandra-bem/ Psychologist's Feminist Voices. ]</ref> The BSRI is a scale developed to determine what kind of sex role an individual fulfills. It is a self-report inventory that asks participants how well 60 different attributes describe themselves by using a seven-point scale.  These attributes reflect the definition of masculinity (20 questions) and femininity (20 questions), and the remaining 20 questions were merely filler questions (Bem, 1993). In this inventory the feminine and masculine items were chosen on what was culturally appropriate for males and females at that time in the early 1970s. The BSRI was later used to measure [[psychological flexibility]] and behavioral indicators.<ref name=\"George\" /> Bem also developed the [[gender schema theory]]. According to the gender schema theory, \"the child learns to evaluate his or her adequacy as a person in terms of the gender schema, to match his or her preferences, attitudes, behaviors, and personal attributes against the prototypes stored within it.\"<ref>Bem, S.L. (1981).\n Gender schema theory; A cognitive account of sex typing, Psychological Review, 88(4), 354-364</ref> This theory states that an individual uses gender as a way to organize various things in a person's life into categories.

The data she collected were supportive of a merging of male and female traits to enable a person to be a fully functioning, adaptive human over an emphasis on gender stereotypes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nShe asserted that masculine and feminine dimensions could be divided into two spheres, rather than one:   \nA person with high masculine and low feminine identification would be categorized as \"masculine\". \nA person with high feminine identification and low masculine identification, would be categorized as \"feminine\".  \nA person who had high identification with both characteristics would be categorized as \"androgynous\".  \nA person who has low identification with both dimensions would be considered \"undifferentiated\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.be-me.org/learningpackages/package2/2.asp |title=Psychologist Sandra Bem |publisher=BE-ME Education |date= |accessdate=2012-09-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304115348/http://www.be-me.org/learningpackages/package2/2.asp |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOne of Bem's main arguments was that traditional gender roles are restrictive for both men and women, and can have negative consequences for individuals as well as society as a whole.\n\nAs previously mentioned, a person could be categorized as \"androgynous\" when taking the BSRI. Androgyny is defined as \"the integration of both masculinity and femininity in a single individual\". Androgyny allows one to freely engage in both masculine and feminine behaviors. According to Bem, people's behavior can demonstrate what she defined as situational appropriateness. Situational appropriateness is demonstrated when behavior is reflective of one's environment. For example, a woman demonstrating knowledge of sports at a basketball game is appropriate. Androgyny may also blend modalities. An example of androgyny blending modalities would be a woman being both assertive and compassionate when firing someone from a job.<ref>Bem,S.L.(1974). The measure of psychological androgyny.

Her first was the [[American Psychological Association]] Distinguished Scientific Award for an Early Career contribution to Psychology in 1976. In 1977 she was awarded the Distinguished Publication Award of the Association of Women in Psychology and in 1980 she received the Young Scholar Award of the [[American Association of University Women]] (Makosky, 1990).

She grew up in a working class family with one younger sister, Beverly. Both of Bem's parents worked throughout her life, so she grew up with the assumption that she would always be working. Her mother encouraged her to be the absolute best that she could be, and that \"being just a housewife was not very desirable.\"<ref name=Makosky />\n\nBem's first career goal was to be a secretary like her mother, so that she could have her own phone and desk \u2013 symbols of autonomy and status that her father never had.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|title=Sandra Lipsitz Bem: Early career award|journal=American Psychologist|date=1997|volume=32|issue=1|pages=88\u201391|doi=10.1037/h0078488}}</ref> Bem was raised by her [[Jewish]] working class parents in a government-subsidized neighborhood for the first eight years of her life. During Bem's childhood, her mother would have violent outburst and fights with her father causing her family much distress.<ref name=\"Koesterer\"/> Her mother was the dominant figure in her parents' relationship, and Bem recalls having a very tumultuous childhood, during which Mrs. Lipsitz would become extremely emotional while upset and throw objects during arguments.<ref>{{cite web|last=George|first=M.|title=Profile of Sandra Bem|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/sandra-bem/|publisher=Psychology's Feminist Voices Multimedia Internet Archive}}</ref> Bem also stated that she was quite unsuccessful in her attempts at flirting and dating with men, and so she internalized a belief that no man would ever want to marry her, which helped to solidify her career ambitions.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBut she eventually married [[Daryl Bem]], also a psychology professor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nussbaum |first1=Emily |date=May\u2013June 1998 |title=Does the exotic become erotic? |journal=Lingua Franca |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |url=http://www.emilynussbaum.com/lingua_franca/1998/05/does_the_exotic_become_erotic.php |accessdate=January 8, 2011}}</ref> The two met when she took his social psychology class at [[Carnegie\u2013Mellon University]].

The radiation mutated him into a green-skinned, super-intelligent entity who names himself the Leader, embarking on a career of crime. He is repeatedly foiled by the Hulk, who overcomes all of the Leader's schemes as well as his artificial henchmen known as the Humanoids. Sterns would later be further transformed, causing his cranium to change into the shape of an oversized brain. As part of the Intelligencia, he is an integral part of the ''[[Hulked Out Heroes]]'' storyline.\n\nActor [[Tim Blake Nelson]] portrayed an unmutated Dr. Samuel Sterns in the 2008 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\nThe character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #62,<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | url = |  doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6 | page = 9}}</ref> and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn Samuel Sterns in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he worked for a [[chemical plant]] in a menial capacity. While moving radioactive materials into an underground storage area, some of the radioactive materials explode, bombarding Sterns with [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. He recovers, and finds that the [[radiation]] has changed him from an ordinary human into a green-skinned, super-intelligent entity with an oversized brain housed in a towering cranium.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\">''Tales to Astonish'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref> As is the case with most individuals mutated by gamma radiation early-on, the particular set of characteristics Sterns acquired by exposure to it were said to result from a subconscious desire; in his case, the desire to be as smart as his brother Philip, who was a physicist in the employ of the same facility. Calling himself the Leader, Sterns embarks on various ambitious criminal schemes, with the [[Hulk]] as his primary nemesis, consistently backed by a self-constructed army of super-strong, virtually invulnerable plastic Humanoids.\n\nThe Leader creates a spy ring to overthrow the [[United States]] [[USFG|federal government]]. He sends a spy to steal a robot Dr. [[Bruce Banner]] was developing. The spy is knocked into a deep pit by the Hulk, and is trapped there. The Leader dispatches the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to find out why the spy has failed to report back.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60-62. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although the Chameleon fails at this, he informs the Leader of the secret shipment of a newly developed nuclear device, the Absorbatron. The Leader sends a Humanoid to steal the device. The Humanoid is stopped by the Hulk, who the Leader sees for the first time through his Humanoid's eyes. He deduces that the Hulk is a creation of gamma radiation like himself, and becomes immediately obsessed with learning more about him.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\"/> Thus, though he sends out a horde of Humanoids to seize the Absorbatron while it is being tested on a deserted island, when the Hulk is sighted there he focuses on capturing him instead, now convinced that the two of them are \"fated to become allies\". However, the Hulk is unwittingly saved from capture by US army troops.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #64-65. Marvel Comics.</ref> A third attempt at stealing the Absorbatron is successful, and the Hulk is delivered into the Leader's hands at the same time. However, while the Leader is still scientifically studying him, the Hulk breaks free and proves impossible to reason with. He destroys the Absorbatron, and the Leader narrowly escapes with his life.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #68-69. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to sell his {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall Humanoid to a hostile nation, the Leader arranges a demonstration of its power by ordering it to attack a nearby missile base. However, the army hits the Humanoid with a \"Sunday Punch\" missile, rendering it inoperative.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #70-71. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the army subsequently corners the Hulk in a cave, the Leader rescues him, and the two become uneasy allies.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader operates on the Hulk to remove what would have been a fatal bullet in his skull, and further enhances his strength with a shower of gamma rays. The two of them team up to steal the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s \"Ultimate Machine\", a device containing all the knowledge in the universe.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #73. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rather than stop them directly, the Watcher implants within the device an image so horrifying that using it causes the Leader to collapse dead from sheer terror.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Leader had made preparations even for his death; a special Humanoid was programmed to activate when his heart stops beating, and carried the Leader to a \"Revivo-Beam\" which restored him to life, since his gamma-infused body takes longer to reach [[brain death]] than that of a normal person. In addition, his usage of the Ultimate Machine apparently unlocked several previously latent mental powers.<ref name=\"Incredible115\">''Incredible Hulk'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter months in hiding, the Leader offers [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] aid in neutralizing the Hulk, containing him within a cage of plastithene.<ref name=\"Incredible115\"/> However, [[Betty Ross]] overhears the Leader gloating to himself about his real plan: to take over the base and use its nuclear missiles to set off a nuclear war, thus annihilating most of humanity and making it easy for him to take over. She frees the Hulk, who stops the Leader's plan. However, the Leader escapes and uses his powers to erase all memory of his scheme from the base's inhabitants except Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #116-117. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader hijacks the U.S. Army's Murder Module vehicle, but it is then destroyed by the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref> As revenge, he interrupts the wedding of Banner (the Hulk's alter ego) and Ross by shooting Banner with a ray which turns him into an unusually savage form of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> After briefly turning back into Samuel Sterns to question Banner about the Hulk's possible weaknesses, he resurrects the [[Glob (comics)#Joseph \"Joe\" Timms|Glob]] and brainwashes him into attacking the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader next tries petitioning General Ross and Major [[Glenn Talbot]] to let him use the U.S. Army's Brain-Wave Booster, a mental amplifier so powerful that no normal human can use it. In a [[retcon]] of his earlier mind-wipe, Ross and Talbot remember the Leader's attempt to set off nuclear Armageddon, but they trust him to use the device responsibly anyway. He briefly uses the device to beset the Hulk with three-dimensional projections of his enemies, but the Brain-Wave Booster proves too advanced for even the Leader's brain, and it causes him to suffer a mental breakdown.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader then creates android duplicates of the President, the Vice President, and military personnel in an attempt to kidnap the real President and Vice President.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #146-147. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then superimposed his consciousness upon the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] in order to battle the Hulk.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #157-159\">''Incredible Hulk'' #157-159. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later used the Hulk and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as pawns in a contest with Kurrgo the Planet Master and his robot. Both of them are defeated. While Kurrgo's starship exploded, the Leader survived, while the fate of Kurrgo and his robot are unknown.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSome time later, the Leader briefly took over Gamma Base.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #223-225. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time after that, he gamma-irradiated Manhattan's water supply in an attempt to mutate humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later activated [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], and then dispatched the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] through time.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #280-284. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter a period of time, the gamma radiation in his body began to wear off. At first, the Leader attributed his lapses in concentration to overworking his mind finding ways to defeat his greatest enemy (the Hulk). By the time the Leader realized what was happening, much of the intelligence that could have solved his plight was gone and texts that were once child's play to him were now hopelessly beyond him (he even forgot the access code of his secret base). In this period, he made cash however he could by fair means or foul, until he managed to convince the Gray Hulk to help him regain his intelligence by promising that he would help the latter to remain the Hulk full-time (instead of only at night).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\n[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] had been afflicted with a Hulk-like condition and the Hulk (using Bruce Banner's memories of gamma transfer) devised a machine to transfer all of the gamma radiation from Rick Jones to the Leader. However, this time the mutagenic process was slightly different, resulting in a cranium that resembled an oversized brain, rather than a towering forehead. He was also a lighter shade of green. As a side note, this transfer also created a psychic link between the two.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\">''Incredible Hulk'' #342. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSoon after this, the Leader would steal the seemingly lifeless body of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] from the back of an ambulance, simply because it was there, and later managed to revive it as a mindless vegetable, which he used as an armored enforcer.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\">''Incredible Hulk'' #400. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBefore long, the Leader's new form was revealed, and he dispatched [[Halflife (comics)#Half-Life (Anthony Masterson)|Half-Life]] to battle the Hulk.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\"/> The Leader dispatched an army of four-armed robots against the Hulk, and created Rock and Redeemer.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #343. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Leader dispatched Rock and Redeemer against the Hulk. Following this, the Leader engaged in a scheme to detonate a gamma-bomb in a small-town city, Middletown, Arizona, killing over 5,000 people, and the few, now enhanced, survivors provided him with valuable research subjects and superhuman enforcers called the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #344-345. Marvel Comics.</ref> With their help, he built a self-sufficient society called Freehold in the Arctic, populated with civilians dying from radiation poisoning. Some time afterward, he gave the Hulk information how to find his brother, Philip Sterns, a.k.a. the [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]], since he thought it would be best to put the latter out of his suffering, due to his original personality being slowly and painfully eaten away by the Madman persona.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #366. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter Jones suffered a great mental trauma due to the death of his girlfriend Marlo Chandler, his pain was enough to cause the Leader considerable discomfort, motivating him to work towards the revival of Marlo. At this time, Freehold was targeted by a rogue branch of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] terrorists, employing the [[U-Foes]] and his followers to invade the covert [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] organization, of which the Hulk was a member, to coerce them to help him in defending it. He employed something he ironically called the ''Deus Ex Machina'' in conjunction with his follower, the gamma-enhanced Reverend nicknamed Soul Man, who falsely believed himself to have been blessed by God with spiritual power, rather than given nearly godlike abilities by the Leader, in an effort to revive Marlo and siphon off Soul Man's power for himself. Rick Jones became convinced to accept the help after seeing the mindless, but mobile, body of Thunderbolt Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397-399. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Hulk, manipulated by the leader of the Pantheon, Agamemnon, attacked the facility. At the same time, HYDRA decided to storm the base, leading to a multi-sided battle. The Hulk eventually personally attacked the Leader, who, along with Soul Man, seemingly perished in the crossfire. The machine was likewise demolished, causing Marlo to enter a state similar to Ross, but both eventually fully recovered.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\"/>\n\nThe death of the Leader left his follower Omnibus in control of Freehold. Omnibus used mind-control to manipulate several U.S. Chiefs of Staff, and engineered many high-profile terrorist strikes to incite global warfare, as he reasoned that it was inevitable, and hurrying it along offered him opportunity to enable his personal society to survive and inherit the Earth. Omnibus was eventually exposed by his fellow Freehold citizens, judged to die in the cold, and was eaten by a polar bear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #442. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bruce Banner also saw the Leader in a supposed trip to Hell.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nA while later, the Hulk, who in his Bruce Banner persona was suffering from a degenerative nervous condition (which would ultimately kill him), was confronted by the Leader once again. Apparently he really had perished when the Deus Ex Machina was destroyed, but his disembodied consciousness had evolved beyond the need for a body. Although he was in the process of building a new body out of random organic materials in a secluded cave near Gamma Base, he was preparing to leave this level of reality behind altogether, transcending both beyond the physical and his old goals. Yet before he did so, he intended to cure Bruce Banner for reasons all his own. After he had done so, he abandoned his body. However, later still his consciousness once again contacted Banner, apparently shocked by what he had discovered \"beyond the veil\"; he was unable to return, however, and was not heard from again until much later.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #30-32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring a time of great personal duress for the Hulk and Bruce Banner, who had begun to merge their personas, it became clear that Home Base, a secret organization who had relentlessly pursued the Hulk in order to obtain his genetic material, was secretly led by the Leader. In the end, after all his other agendas had failed, the Leader finally managed to mind-control the Hulk and guided him towards his secret base, with the intention of taking his indestructible body for himself. Because of intervention by Nadia Blonsky, [[Betty Ross]], [[Doc Samson]], and [[Iron Man]], the plan failed and the Leader died again.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #75-76\">''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #75-76. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThese events, bizarre and nebulous as they seem, may or may not have taken place in this form...they may be partly true, or entirely a construct by the extra-dimensional demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in a bid to avenge himself on the Hulk.{{issue|date=October 2012}} At present, the Leader has a body incorporating traits from both his previous incarnations; it is unknown exactly how he acquired it, but it may have been relatively easy, given his history.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe Leader is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Hulkbusters#S.H.I.E.L.D's Hulkbusters|Hulkbusters]], and brought to trial for his crimes. He was represented by Attorney Mallory Book from the [[She-Hulk]]'s firm [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]. During the trial, Ms. Book argued that the Leader was not responsible for his actions since the gamma exposure forcibly changed his personality. To prove her point, Book compared the She-Hulk to Jennifer Walters, revealing that Jennifer was much more [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] in her She-Hulk form. In the second day of the trial, the Leader's Humanoids arrived to rescue him. Instead of escaping, the Leader called off the attack, opting to see the trial to its conclusion, as he correctly predicted that his defense was going to win. He was found not guilty.<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol. 4) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is as yet unclear whether this person is indeed the original Leader, or the Samuel Sterns of \"Earth-Alpha\", the inhabitants of which had been swapping places with their 616 counterparts for a while prior to this trial.\n\n[[File:Leaderhulk.PNG|thumb|upright|The Leader in ''WWH Aftersmash: Warbound'' #2 (Jan. 2008). Art by [[Leonard Kirk]].]]\nNow a free man (whichever one he may be), the Leader teleported the Hulk's allies, the [[Warbound]], to Nevada. There, he used [[Hiroim]] of the Warbound, harnessing his tectonic power to activate a gamma powered shield over a portion of the desert. It is revealed that the Leader is dying, and that he constructed the dome to cure him. Due to a miscalculation, the energy of the dome actually kills him faster.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash! Warbound'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In battle with the Warbound, the Leader is stabbed through the chest with an iron pipe. The Leader then absorbed the power of the dome, turning himself into a gray-skinned giant. Hiroim also absorbed the power and battled the Leader, draining both of their powers. In death, Hiroim channels his old power into Kate Waynseboro, who attacks the Leader, and forces him to teleport away.<ref>''Warbound'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Leader, apparently healthy and in the form he originally had, appears once again, this time with designs on the Hulk's son Skaar. It is eventually revealed that he, along with a select group of genius super-villains, is part of a longtime collaboration he calls the Intelligencia.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Leader was also responsible for mutating [[Marlo Chandler]] into the second Harpy. During that time, he planned revenge on Kate Waynesboro.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the Red Hulk storyline, a newly rejuvenated Red Hulk approaches the Leader and gets close enough to him to completely drain the body-altering gamma radiation from the Leader's physiology. The Red Hulk does this as a punishment for the Leader's altering of Ross's/the Red Hulk's daughter into the Red She-Hulk. The Red Hulk leaves Sterns alive to suffer, reminding him that as the person he has been reverted to with his original, well below-average intelligence, Sterns will never be able to duplicate a gamma-infusion and restore his powers as the Leader...at least not on his own.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA powerless Leader is later seen in custody demanding \"gamma\" (the one thing no one is willing to give him) if he was to divulge any information on stopping the Intelligencia's fail-safe doomsday plans.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the second issue of the new ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a powerless Samuel Sterns is seen apparently housed within a shipping container. His head is connected to a machine apparently emitting red gamma radiation (in the fashion of the Red Hulk) with the harness in the shape of the Leader's formerly tall head. Samuel Sterns is apparently in the custody of the Red Hulk.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the third issue, Samuel Sterns has reddish-hued skin, but with no apparent powers. Once Deadpool sees that the Red Hulk is employing Samuel Sterns, he expresses his view that the Punisher will not be pleased. As soon as the Punisher sees Samuel Sterns, he shoots him right between the eyes, killing him and foiling the Red Hulk's plan.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight against the Madman, the Red Hulk took him to a pipeline that feeds gamma energy to the Madman's lab.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then force-fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Leader then joins the Thunderbolts under the new alias the Red Leader. The Red Leader then realized that his brother, the Madman, had tricked him into divulging where he hid his second brain and the algorithm hiding it\u2014it was on the Internet. After gaining back his memory and intellect, he then whispers something into his brother's ears that causes him to die.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #6\"/>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Red Leader then tricks the Thunderbolts into taking names out of a hat to decide whose mission will be next. He picks the name, since he has \"no skin in the game\", and chooses the Punisher, since he knows he will want to go to New York City. He hopes to escape Ross, but the [[Infinity (comic book)|''Infinity'' crossover]] occurs and he is forced to release [[Mercy (comics)|Mercy]] when [[Supergiant (comics)|Supergiant]] of [[Thanos]]' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] sucks out part of his intellect. He then helps the Red Hulk destroy the Black Order's flagship, but only for self-preservation. He constantly broods over how he should kill the rest of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater the team is teleported to Hell and the Red Leader then negotiates a contract with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that if the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and the Red Hulk defeat the current leader of Hell, [[Strong Guy]], they will be teleported out and Mephisto will take control of Mercy, as well as other secret stipulations.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20\">''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Red Leader then helps the team navigate the haunted swamps of [[Honduras]], since he can translate an ancient map. During the boat ride, he whispers something in an ancient language that causes the Ghost Rider to lose his powers and get devoured by a tentacled monster. Their river guide then makes a deal with the Red Leader to betray his team, but the Red Leader double-crosses him and the team kills the guide's ambush. The Red Leader then tells the team to enter the temple, but via a booby-trapped path that gets them all killed, except for Ross, who finds the source of the temple's power\u2014an infant [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]'s head. The Red Leader is killed when his head explodes after drinking the Celestial's blood. He and the team are revived when Ross makes a deal with a Celestial-powered being and teleports them back to before the mission started.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the Punisher quits the team, the Red Leader, long looking for ways to kill the Thunderbolts and knowing Castle had countermeasures to take each of them down, puts a bomb in his safe house with a note saying \"You don't quit us. You're fired\", knowing that he would survive and that he would think it was Ross who attempted to kill him and thus would take the Thunderbolts down.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSix months after the Thunderbolts disbanded, the Red Leader had built his own criminal empire in Kata Jaya. Living a life of luxury and trying to conquer the heart of the girl he was in love with, the Red Leader saw everything he had built be destroyed by his former partners and the Avengers. Betrayed by Caitlin (the girl he loved), the Red Leader was captured by them and put in jail. The Punisher used the Ghost Rider's skull to put the Red Leader under a permanent Penance Stare, but he was eventually freed from it by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (with whom he had made a deal when he went to Hell along with the Thunderbolts).<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20\"/> Enraged by the fact that the Red Leader had reneged on their deal, Mephisto made him sign a new contract and led him to Hell.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of his measure to neutralize gamma mutates across the world, the Hulk's Doc Green form pinned down the Red Leader, who, through unknown means, had escaped from Hell, started to play with occultism and neutralized his gamma-powered abilities. However, the Red Leader had reached out previously to Gammon (an artificial intelligence duplicate of Doc Green) who had implemented a countermeasure against Doc Green's actions. As soon as he was de-powered, the Red Leader slowly transformed again. However, instead of transforming back into Samuel Sterns, the Red Leader transformed back to the Leader. He and Gammon agreed to work together.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 3) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \"Hulkverines\" miniseries, the Leader is shown to be detained at Shadow Base Remote Facility 43B using Big Bob's Lumber Lounge in Akron, Ohio as a front. He is approached by Agent Castillo, who informs him that the Hulk has returned from the dead and they need his help to kill him. The Leader accepts, but stabs Agent Castillo, stating that he would rather do it himself. The Leader arrives at the area where the Hulk and [[Weapon H]] are fighting each other, until Shadow Base agents led by Agent NG catch up to him. As the Hulk starts sneezing, the Leader states to Agent NG that he infected Clayton Cortez with a gamma-altering virus. Arriving where Weapon H had knocked the Hulk unconscious, the Leader begs for Weapon H to finish him off. When the Leader threatens his family as part of Plan C, he detonates some bombs near Weapon H in order to get away. Clayton chases after the Leader until [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] arrives.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Leader brings out the Humanoids, only to be regressed back to their pods by reverse-engineered Humanoids when former [[Weapon X]] Project scientist Dr. Aliana Alba shows up. She advises the Leader to leave the disposal of Wolverine to her. After a brief fight, the Leader explains that he was pursuing the Hulk, while Dr. Alba states that she was pursuing Wolverine. They come to a conclusion that they were manipulated by [[Minotaur (comics)|someone who wants Weapon H dead]]. This leads to them making plans to capture the Hulk in order to collaborate on a project. The Leader and Dr. Alba later attack Shadow Base's Remote Facility FN34.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the larger Humanoid abducts Wolverine and Bruce Banner, it brings them to Shadow Base's Remote Facility FN34 as they begin the experiment that gives the Hulk the claws of Wolverine and Wolverine the strength of the Hulk. The Leader and Dr. Alba unleash the mutated Hulk and Wolverine on Shadow Base Auto-Op WMD Facility BX91 in Central, Ohio using Green Energy Corp as a front. Weapon H arrives and lures them towards the Leader and Dr. Alba. When Weapon H destroys the remote-control in the Leader's hand, Dr. Alba withdraws the nanobots that were placed in Wolverine and Bruce Banner and places them in Weapon H. It does not work on Weapon H, as the Leader repairs his teleporter enough to get himself and Dr. Alba away from Weapon H. After watching the aftermath from afar, the Leader and Dr. Alba share a romantic kiss as they embrace each other.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Leader has superhuman [[Mind|mental]] acumen, as a result of his exposure to an explosion of gamma-irradiated waste. He is capable of knowledge and comprehension that is beyond the human ability to understand. The potential of his intelligence is nearly unlimited, being capable of mastering every worldly subject and adopting concepts completely foreign to his environment. His higher brain functions, including pattern recognition, information storage and retrieval, and logical and philosophical structuring have been enhanced to inhuman levels. He also has total recall of every event he has witnessed since the accident that transformed him and can calculate possibilities and outcomes so accurately that it borders on predicting the future. Despite his limitless intelligence and supreme knowledge, his effectiveness is greatly hampered by his own arrogance, immaturity, and obsession with defeating the Hulk, which constantly causes him to lose sight of necessary details and act prematurely, causing the ruin of his schemes. His egotism has also led him to embark on two mad, impractical schemes to turn the rest of humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.\n\nAfter the Leader revived himself after his near-death exposure to the Watcher's Ultimate Machine, he has unlocked previously latent telekinetic and telepathic powers within him.{{issue|date=February 2019}} He is able to control the minds of ordinary humans by touching them (aside from gamma-mutated individuals like the Hulk or the Abomination), wipe memories of several humans at once, create illusions to trick others or disguise himself, and project telekinetic blasts potent enough to topple a very weakened Hulk.\n\nThe Leader is also a technological genius that specializes in gamma radiation. He has created a large array of technology far beyond human ability, including vehicles, weaponry, computers, androids, and synthetic lifeforms, personal weapons such as laser pistols, pulse weapons, and kinetic gauntlets, and is particularly adept at genetic engineering and manipulating radiation for many nefarious purposes. The Leader also has an army of synthetic henchmen at his disposal called \"Humanoids\", created by the Leader and which have served him throughout his career of world domination, mainly as bodyguards, soldiers, and lab servants. They have versatile programming capacities to allow them to perform any task, do not tire or need sustenance, and have elastic-like bodies that make them immune to blunt impacts. The Humanoids are usually controlled directly through the Leader's own mental commands, but can also be pre-programmed to carry out a certain directive. The Leader has also developed gamma bombs, shield generators to cover large areas, cages for holding the Hulk, teleportation devices, android duplicates, a means of controlling the minds of the Hulk or the Rhino through devices,<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #157-159\"/><ref name=\"Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #75-76\"/> a Revivo-Beam which was designed to restore him to life in the event of his death,<ref name=\"Incredible115\">''Incredible Hulk'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Omnivac,{{issue|date=November 2018}} a sentient computer that maintains the space station he has used as a base of operations.\n\nOn occasion, the Leader showed the ability to turn himself back into Samuel Sterns, but this ability resulted in him losing all memory of his identity as the Leader as Stern's mind was ill-equipped to cope with the Leader's intellect (although he always remembered everything when he turned back into the Leader again).\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in===\nPrior to the release of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012, Marvel ran a series of canon tie-in comics entitled ''[[Fury's Big Week|Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]'', which take place within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In issues #6-7, Sterns is seen undergoing a rapid head mutation just as he is discovered by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Film|Natasha Romanoff]] who stumbles upon him immediately after the Hulk has escaped (which happens during the climax of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', while the Hulk is fighting the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]). Although his brainpower has already drastically increased to the point where he can pinpoint the exact location of the Black Widow's birth just by a brief hint of [[Stalingrad]] in her accent, Natasha shoots him in the leg when he attempts to bribe her by offering to help her return to her home and he is detained into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.<ref>''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' #6-7 (March 2012).

He has a giant hole blown through his [[cranium]], which does not stop him.<ref>''Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness'' #3 (2007). Marvel Comics.</ref> He is also in ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]'' where he is looking over food and medical supplies that other zombies have found as an offering to a zombie [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]. The Leader determines how long the others can feed on the human clones. The Leader is sent with other zombified superbeings to find and destroy [[Machine Man]]. The android gains the upper hand in the battle and destroys all his pursuers. The Zombie Leader then kills himself by ripping out his arm, using it to take out all of his brain, and ripping out his own body.<ref>''Marvel Zombies 3'' #2-3 (2008).

In the Ultimate universe, Wisdom is an ex-British Intelligence agent thrown out of the organization after testing his \"British Enhancile Program\" on himself, transforming him into the Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #1 (January 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wisdom has psychic and mental abilities similar to the original Leader, but requires a wheelchair and a [[Halo (medicine)|halo]] brace to support the weight of his enlarged cranium. The Leader attempts to steal Tony Stark's nanotechnology, as Banner and Stark work together to try to incorporate it into Banner's physiology in the hopes that it will grant him control over his transformations into the Hulk. When Stark commands a decoy Iron-Tech robot into the base of the Leader, Banner transforms into the Hulk. The Hulk resists the Leader's influence, and pounds him into the ground. The Leader, almost dead, commands a C-17 down onto the Hulk, ultimately killing Wisdom/the Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Ultimate Mystery]]'', an elderly Dr. Samuel Sterns (who is seen in a wheelchair) is amongst a group of younger versions of Earth-616 villains and heroes, including [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Arnim Zola]] III, [[Misty Knight]], [[Mister Sinister|Nathaniel Essex]], and Dr. [[Layla Miller]]. They represent a [[brain trust]] for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Industries]].<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #3</ref> He is later transformed into a Hulk/Leader hybrid, where he attacks [[Spider-Man]], but is defeated.<ref>''Ultimate Mystery'' #4.

He is served by the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], the [[Ogress (comics)|Ogress]], and the Gamma Warriors (who were created from the Hulk's DNA). In this version, the Leader's origin is changed to link with the Hulk's. Samuel Stern was one of the scientists working on the gamma bomb, but sabotaged the bomb's test; when Rick Jones was trapped on the site, Bruce Banner ran out to save him and was transformed into the Hulk. Shortly afterwards, Stern fell into a pit of radioactive waste left from the gamma bomb, which mutated him into the Leader.\n* The Leader cameos in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Tremble at the Might of MODOK\".

When the Avengers and the Red Hulk show up, the Leader unleashes [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]] on them, while he gets away. When at an offshore island, the Leader makes it so that the Red Hulk gets caught by the traps that the Avengers have a hard time getting through. The Leader lures the Red Hulk into a room that contained a particle-accelerator gamma bomb, which he will use on the Red Hulk. After the Red Hulk fails to disarm the bomb and is caught in the explosion, the Leader appears before the Avengers stating that he created the perfect weapon, as an enlarged Red Hulk appears near him. In the episode \"World War Hulk\", the Leader loses control of the Red Hulk and is beaten into a state of unconsciousness. In the two-part episode \"Avengers No More\", the Leader steals the prototype Arc Reactor and some Vibranium from the Wakandan Consulate, which leads him into conflict with the Avengers. When they catch him, he summons a new incarnation of the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] consisting of [[Arnim Zola]], the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Using the stolen Vibranium and Arc Reactor prototype, the Leader builds the Static Expander to immobilize the Avengers in order to send them across time and space. When the Black Panther returns with the reserve members, the Leader is defeated where he asks the Cabal to help him. Arnim Zola and the Enchantress tell him that he is not the Cabal's \"true leader\", as the Cabal gets away. After the Avengers are scattered across time and space, the Black Panther's group takes the Leader into their custody.\n* The Leader appears in the ''[[Marvel Future Avengers]]'' anime series, voiced by [[Yoshihito Sasaki]] in Japanese and [[Benjamin Diskin]] in English.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Film===\n* Dr. Samuel Sterns appears in the film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', portrayed by [[Tim Blake Nelson]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2593169/tim-blake-nelson-will-battle-hulk-as-the-leader-in-incredible-hulk-2-with-or-without-ed-norton/ |title=Tim Blake Nelson Will Battle Hulk As 'The Leader' In 'Incredible Hulk 2' \u2014 With Or Without Ed Norton |last=Carroll |first=Larry |date=November 21, 2008 |website=[[MTV]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EdVqkyUK?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/11/21/tim-blake-nelson-will-battle-hulk-as-the-leader-in-incredible-hulk-2-with-or-without-ed-norton/ |archive-date=February 23, 2013 |access-date=November 21, 2008}}</ref> In this film, he is a [[Harlem]] based university professor trying to help Bruce Banner find a cure for his transformations, while operating under the alias of \"Mr. Blue\".

He is repeatedly foiled by the Hulk, who overcomes all of the Leader's schemes as well as his artificial henchmen known as the Humanoids. Sterns would later be further transformed, causing his cranium to change into the shape of an oversized brain. As part of the Intelligencia, he is an integral part of the ''[[Hulked Out Heroes]]'' storyline.\n\nActor [[Tim Blake Nelson]] portrayed an unmutated Dr. Samuel Sterns in the 2008 [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2015}}\nThe character first appeared in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'' #62,<ref name=\"mnyc\">{{Cite book| last = Sanderson | first = Peter | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | url = |  doi = | id = | isbn = 1-4165-3141-6 | page = 9}}</ref> and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nBorn Samuel Sterns in [[Boise]], [[Idaho]], he worked for a [[chemical plant]] in a menial capacity. While moving radioactive materials into an underground storage area, some of the radioactive materials explode, bombarding Sterns with [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]]. He recovers, and finds that the [[radiation]] has changed him from an ordinary human into a green-skinned, super-intelligent entity with an oversized brain housed in a towering cranium.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\">''Tales to Astonish'' #63. Marvel Comics.</ref> As is the case with most individuals mutated by gamma radiation early-on, the particular set of characteristics Sterns acquired by exposure to it were said to result from a subconscious desire; in his case, the desire to be as smart as his brother Philip, who was a physicist in the employ of the same facility. Calling himself the Leader, Sterns embarks on various ambitious criminal schemes, with the [[Hulk]] as his primary nemesis, consistently backed by a self-constructed army of super-strong, virtually invulnerable plastic Humanoids.\n\nThe Leader creates a spy ring to overthrow the [[United States]] [[USFG|federal government]]. He sends a spy to steal a robot Dr. [[Bruce Banner]] was developing. The spy is knocked into a deep pit by the Hulk, and is trapped there. The Leader dispatches the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to find out why the spy has failed to report back.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #60-62. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although the Chameleon fails at this, he informs the Leader of the secret shipment of a newly developed nuclear device, the Absorbatron. The Leader sends a Humanoid to steal the device. The Humanoid is stopped by the Hulk, who the Leader sees for the first time through his Humanoid's eyes. He deduces that the Hulk is a creation of gamma radiation like himself, and becomes immediately obsessed with learning more about him.<ref name=\"Tales to Astonish #63\"/> Thus, though he sends out a horde of Humanoids to seize the Absorbatron while it is being tested on a deserted island, when the Hulk is sighted there he focuses on capturing him instead, now convinced that the two of them are \"fated to become allies\". However, the Hulk is unwittingly saved from capture by US army troops.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #64-65. Marvel Comics.</ref> A third attempt at stealing the Absorbatron is successful, and the Hulk is delivered into the Leader's hands at the same time. However, while the Leader is still scientifically studying him, the Hulk breaks free and proves impossible to reason with. He destroys the Absorbatron, and the Leader narrowly escapes with his life.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #68-69. Marvel Comics.</ref> In order to sell his {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall Humanoid to a hostile nation, the Leader arranges a demonstration of its power by ordering it to attack a nearby missile base. However, the army hits the Humanoid with a \"Sunday Punch\" missile, rendering it inoperative.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #70-71. Marvel Comics.</ref> When the army subsequently corners the Hulk in a cave, the Leader rescues him, and the two become uneasy allies.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #72. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader operates on the Hulk to remove what would have been a fatal bullet in his skull, and further enhances his strength with a shower of gamma rays. The two of them team up to steal the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]]'s \"Ultimate Machine\", a device containing all the knowledge in the universe.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #73. Marvel Comics.</ref> Rather than stop them directly, the Watcher implants within the device an image so horrifying that using it causes the Leader to collapse dead from sheer terror.<ref>''Tales to Astonish'' #74. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, the Leader had made preparations even for his death; a special Humanoid was programmed to activate when his heart stops beating, and carried the Leader to a \"Revivo-Beam\" which restored him to life, since his gamma-infused body takes longer to reach [[brain death]] than that of a normal person. In addition, his usage of the Ultimate Machine apparently unlocked several previously latent mental powers.<ref name=\"Incredible115\">''Incredible Hulk'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter months in hiding, the Leader offers [[Thunderbolt Ross|General Ross]] aid in neutralizing the Hulk, containing him within a cage of plastithene.<ref name=\"Incredible115\"/> However, [[Betty Ross]] overhears the Leader gloating to himself about his real plan: to take over the base and use its nuclear missiles to set off a nuclear war, thus annihilating most of humanity and making it easy for him to take over. She frees the Hulk, who stops the Leader's plan. However, the Leader escapes and uses his powers to erase all memory of his scheme from the base's inhabitants except Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #116-117. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader hijacks the U.S. Army's Murder Module vehicle, but it is then destroyed by the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref> As revenge, he interrupts the wedding of Banner (the Hulk's alter ego) and Ross by shooting Banner with a ray which turns him into an unusually savage form of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> After briefly turning back into Samuel Sterns to question Banner about the Hulk's possible weaknesses, he resurrects the [[Glob (comics)#Joseph \"Joe\" Timms|Glob]] and brainwashes him into attacking the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #129. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader next tries petitioning General Ross and Major [[Glenn Talbot]] to let him use the U.S. Army's Brain-Wave Booster, a mental amplifier so powerful that no normal human can use it. In a [[retcon]] of his earlier mind-wipe, Ross and Talbot remember the Leader's attempt to set off nuclear Armageddon, but they trust him to use the device responsibly anyway. He briefly uses the device to beset the Hulk with three-dimensional projections of his enemies, but the Brain-Wave Booster proves too advanced for even the Leader's brain, and it causes him to suffer a mental breakdown.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #139. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Leader then creates android duplicates of the President, the Vice President, and military personnel in an attempt to kidnap the real President and Vice President.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #146-147. Marvel Comics.</ref> He then superimposed his consciousness upon the [[Rhino (character)|Rhino]] in order to battle the Hulk.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #157-159\">''Incredible Hulk'' #157-159. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later used the Hulk and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] as pawns in a contest with Kurrgo the Planet Master and his robot. Both of them are defeated. While Kurrgo's starship exploded, the Leader survived, while the fate of Kurrgo and his robot are unknown.<ref>''Marvel Feature'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSome time later, the Leader briefly took over Gamma Base.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #223-225. Marvel Comics.</ref> Some time after that, he gamma-irradiated Manhattan's water supply in an attempt to mutate humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.<ref>''Incredible Hulk Annual'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> He later activated [[Arsenal (Marvel Comics)|Arsenal]], and then dispatched the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] through time.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #280-284. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter a period of time, the gamma radiation in his body began to wear off. At first, the Leader attributed his lapses in concentration to overworking his mind finding ways to defeat his greatest enemy (the Hulk). By the time the Leader realized what was happening, much of the intelligence that could have solved his plight was gone and texts that were once child's play to him were now hopelessly beyond him (he even forgot the access code of his secret base). In this period, he made cash however he could by fair means or foul, until he managed to convince the Gray Hulk to help him regain his intelligence by promising that he would help the latter to remain the Hulk full-time (instead of only at night).{{Issue|date=October 2009}}\n\n[[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] had been afflicted with a Hulk-like condition and the Hulk (using Bruce Banner's memories of gamma transfer) devised a machine to transfer all of the gamma radiation from Rick Jones to the Leader. However, this time the mutagenic process was slightly different, resulting in a cranium that resembled an oversized brain, rather than a towering forehead. He was also a lighter shade of green. As a side note, this transfer also created a psychic link between the two.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\">''Incredible Hulk'' #342. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSoon after this, the Leader would steal the seemingly lifeless body of General [[Thunderbolt Ross]] from the back of an ambulance, simply because it was there, and later managed to revive it as a mindless vegetable, which he used as an armored enforcer.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\">''Incredible Hulk'' #400. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nBefore long, the Leader's new form was revealed, and he dispatched [[Halflife (comics)#Half-Life (Anthony Masterson)|Half-Life]] to battle the Hulk.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #342\"/> The Leader dispatched an army of four-armed robots against the Hulk, and created Rock and Redeemer.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #343. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Leader dispatched Rock and Redeemer against the Hulk. Following this, the Leader engaged in a scheme to detonate a gamma-bomb in a small-town city, Middletown, Arizona, killing over 5,000 people, and the few, now enhanced, survivors provided him with valuable research subjects and superhuman enforcers called the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #344-345. Marvel Comics.</ref> With their help, he built a self-sufficient society called Freehold in the Arctic, populated with civilians dying from radiation poisoning. Some time afterward, he gave the Hulk information how to find his brother, Philip Sterns, a.k.a. the [[Madman (Marvel Comics)|Madman]], since he thought it would be best to put the latter out of his suffering, due to his original personality being slowly and painfully eaten away by the Madman persona.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #366. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter Jones suffered a great mental trauma due to the death of his girlfriend Marlo Chandler, his pain was enough to cause the Leader considerable discomfort, motivating him to work towards the revival of Marlo. At this time, Freehold was targeted by a rogue branch of [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]] terrorists, employing the [[U-Foes]] and his followers to invade the covert [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] organization, of which the Hulk was a member, to coerce them to help him in defending it. He employed something he ironically called the ''Deus Ex Machina'' in conjunction with his follower, the gamma-enhanced Reverend nicknamed Soul Man, who falsely believed himself to have been blessed by God with spiritual power, rather than given nearly godlike abilities by the Leader, in an effort to revive Marlo and siphon off Soul Man's power for himself. Rick Jones became convinced to accept the help after seeing the mindless, but mobile, body of Thunderbolt Ross.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #397-399. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Hulk, manipulated by the leader of the Pantheon, Agamemnon, attacked the facility. At the same time, HYDRA decided to storm the base, leading to a multi-sided battle. The Hulk eventually personally attacked the Leader, who, along with Soul Man, seemingly perished in the crossfire. The machine was likewise demolished, causing Marlo to enter a state similar to Ross, but both eventually fully recovered.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #400\"/>\n\nThe death of the Leader left his follower Omnibus in control of Freehold. Omnibus used mind-control to manipulate several U.S. Chiefs of Staff, and engineered many high-profile terrorist strikes to incite global warfare, as he reasoned that it was inevitable, and hurrying it along offered him opportunity to enable his personal society to survive and inherit the Earth. Omnibus was eventually exposed by his fellow Freehold citizens, judged to die in the cold, and was eaten by a polar bear.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #442. Marvel Comics.</ref> Bruce Banner also saw the Leader in a supposed trip to Hell.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}\n\nA while later, the Hulk, who in his Bruce Banner persona was suffering from a degenerative nervous condition (which would ultimately kill him), was confronted by the Leader once again. Apparently he really had perished when the Deus Ex Machina was destroyed, but his disembodied consciousness had evolved beyond the need for a body. Although he was in the process of building a new body out of random organic materials in a secluded cave near Gamma Base, he was preparing to leave this level of reality behind altogether, transcending both beyond the physical and his old goals. Yet before he did so, he intended to cure Bruce Banner for reasons all his own. After he had done so, he abandoned his body. However, later still his consciousness once again contacted Banner, apparently shocked by what he had discovered \"beyond the veil\"; he was unable to return, however, and was not heard from again until much later.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #30-32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring a time of great personal duress for the Hulk and Bruce Banner, who had begun to merge their personas, it became clear that Home Base, a secret organization who had relentlessly pursued the Hulk in order to obtain his genetic material, was secretly led by the Leader. In the end, after all his other agendas had failed, the Leader finally managed to mind-control the Hulk and guided him towards his secret base, with the intention of taking his indestructible body for himself. Because of intervention by Nadia Blonsky, [[Betty Ross]], [[Doc Samson]], and [[Iron Man]], the plan failed and the Leader died again.<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #75-76\">''Incredible Hulk'' (vol. 2) #75-76. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThese events, bizarre and nebulous as they seem, may or may not have taken place in this form...they may be partly true, or entirely a construct by the extra-dimensional demon [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]] in a bid to avenge himself on the Hulk.{{issue|date=October 2012}} At present, the Leader has a body incorporating traits from both his previous incarnations; it is unknown exactly how he acquired it, but it may have been relatively easy, given his history.{{issue|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe Leader is captured by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'s [[Hulkbusters#S.H.I.E.L.D's Hulkbusters|Hulkbusters]], and brought to trial for his crimes. He was represented by Attorney Mallory Book from the [[She-Hulk]]'s firm [[Goodman, Lieber, Kurtzberg & Holliway]]. During the trial, Ms. Book argued that the Leader was not responsible for his actions since the gamma exposure forcibly changed his personality. To prove her point, Book compared the She-Hulk to Jennifer Walters, revealing that Jennifer was much more [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] in her She-Hulk form. In the second day of the trial, the Leader's Humanoids arrived to rescue him. Instead of escaping, the Leader called off the attack, opting to see the trial to its conclusion, as he correctly predicted that his defense was going to win. He was found not guilty.<ref>''She-Hulk'' (vol. 4) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is as yet unclear whether this person is indeed the original Leader, or the Samuel Sterns of \"Earth-Alpha\", the inhabitants of which had been swapping places with their 616 counterparts for a while prior to this trial.\n\n[[File:Leaderhulk.PNG|thumb|upright|The Leader in ''WWH Aftersmash: Warbound'' #2 (Jan. 2008). Art by [[Leonard Kirk]].]]\nNow a free man (whichever one he may be), the Leader teleported the Hulk's allies, the [[Warbound]], to Nevada. There, he used [[Hiroim]] of the Warbound, harnessing his tectonic power to activate a gamma powered shield over a portion of the desert. It is revealed that the Leader is dying, and that he constructed the dome to cure him. Due to a miscalculation, the energy of the dome actually kills him faster.<ref>''World War Hulk: Aftersmash! Warbound'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> In battle with the Warbound, the Leader is stabbed through the chest with an iron pipe. The Leader then absorbed the power of the dome, turning himself into a gray-skinned giant. Hiroim also absorbed the power and battled the Leader, draining both of their powers. In death, Hiroim channels his old power into Kate Waynseboro, who attacks the Leader, and forces him to teleport away.<ref>''Warbound'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Leader, apparently healthy and in the form he originally had, appears once again, this time with designs on the Hulk's son Skaar. It is eventually revealed that he, along with a select group of genius super-villains, is part of a longtime collaboration he calls the Intelligencia.<ref>''Fall of the Hulks: Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Leader was also responsible for mutating [[Marlo Chandler]] into the second Harpy. During that time, he planned revenge on Kate Waynesboro.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #604. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of the Red Hulk storyline, a newly rejuvenated Red Hulk approaches the Leader and gets close enough to him to completely drain the body-altering gamma radiation from the Leader's physiology. The Red Hulk does this as a punishment for the Leader's altering of Ross's/the Red Hulk's daughter into the Red She-Hulk. The Red Hulk leaves Sterns alive to suffer, reminding him that as the person he has been reverted to with his original, well below-average intelligence, Sterns will never be able to duplicate a gamma-infusion and restore his powers as the Leader...at least not on his own.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #23. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nA powerless Leader is later seen in custody demanding \"gamma\" (the one thing no one is willing to give him) if he was to divulge any information on stopping the Intelligencia's fail-safe doomsday plans.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 2) #28. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the second issue of the new ''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' series as part of the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, a powerless Samuel Sterns is seen apparently housed within a shipping container. His head is connected to a machine apparently emitting red gamma radiation (in the fashion of the Red Hulk) with the harness in the shape of the Leader's formerly tall head. Samuel Sterns is apparently in the custody of the Red Hulk.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the third issue, Samuel Sterns has reddish-hued skin, but with no apparent powers. Once Deadpool sees that the Red Hulk is employing Samuel Sterns, he expresses his view that the Punisher will not be pleased. As soon as the Punisher sees Samuel Sterns, he shoots him right between the eyes, killing him and foiling the Red Hulk's plan.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight against the Madman, the Red Hulk took him to a pipeline that feeds gamma energy to the Madman's lab.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Red Hulk then absorbed the energy himself and then force-fed it to the Leader, bringing him back to life.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #5.

The Red Leader then realized that his brother, the Madman, had tricked him into divulging where he hid his second brain and the algorithm hiding it\u2014it was on the Internet. After gaining back his memory and intellect, he then whispers something into his brother's ears that causes him to die.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #6\"/>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Red Leader then tricks the Thunderbolts into taking names out of a hat to decide whose mission will be next. He picks the name, since he has \"no skin in the game\", and chooses the Punisher, since he knows he will want to go to New York City. He hopes to escape Ross, but the [[Infinity (comic book)|''Infinity'' crossover]] occurs and he is forced to release [[Mercy (comics)|Mercy]] when [[Supergiant (comics)|Supergiant]] of [[Thanos]]' [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]] sucks out part of his intellect. He then helps the Red Hulk destroy the Black Order's flagship, but only for self-preservation. He constantly broods over how he should kill the rest of the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #19. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nLater the team is teleported to Hell and the Red Leader then negotiates a contract with [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] that if the [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]] and the Red Hulk defeat the current leader of Hell, [[Strong Guy]], they will be teleported out and Mephisto will take control of Mercy, as well as other secret stipulations.<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20\">''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nThe Red Leader then helps the team navigate the haunted swamps of [[Honduras]], since he can translate an ancient map. During the boat ride, he whispers something in an ancient language that causes the Ghost Rider to lose his powers and get devoured by a tentacled monster. Their river guide then makes a deal with the Red Leader to betray his team, but the Red Leader double-crosses him and the team kills the guide's ambush. The Red Leader then tells the team to enter the temple, but via a booby-trapped path that gets them all killed, except for Ross, who finds the source of the temple's power\u2014an infant [[Celestial (comics)|Celestial]]'s head. The Red Leader is killed when his head explodes after drinking the Celestial's blood. He and the team are revived when Ross makes a deal with a Celestial-powered being and teleports them back to before the mission started.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #26. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the Punisher quits the team, the Red Leader, long looking for ways to kill the Thunderbolts and knowing Castle had countermeasures to take each of them down, puts a bomb in his safe house with a note saying \"You don't quit us. You're fired\", knowing that he would survive and that he would think it was Ross who attempted to kill him and thus would take the Thunderbolts down.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #31. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nSix months after the Thunderbolts disbanded, the Red Leader had built his own criminal empire in Kata Jaya. Living a life of luxury and trying to conquer the heart of the girl he was in love with, the Red Leader saw everything he had built be destroyed by his former partners and the Avengers. Betrayed by Caitlin (the girl he loved), the Red Leader was captured by them and put in jail. The Punisher used the Ghost Rider's skull to put the Red Leader under a permanent Penance Stare, but he was eventually freed from it by [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] (with whom he had made a deal when he went to Hell along with the Thunderbolts).<ref name=\"Thunderbolts vol. 2 #20\"/> Enraged by the fact that the Red Leader had reneged on their deal, Mephisto made him sign a new contract and led him to Hell.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' (vol. 2) #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAs part of his measure to neutralize gamma mutates across the world, the Hulk's Doc Green form pinned down the Red Leader, who, through unknown means, had escaped from Hell, started to play with occultism and neutralized his gamma-powered abilities. However, the Red Leader had reached out previously to Gammon (an artificial intelligence duplicate of Doc Green) who had implemented a countermeasure against Doc Green's actions. As soon as he was de-powered, the Red Leader slowly transformed again. However, instead of transforming back into Samuel Sterns, the Red Leader transformed back to the Leader. He and Gammon agreed to work together.<ref>''Hulk'' (vol. 3) #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn the \"Hulkverines\" miniseries, the Leader is shown to be detained at Shadow Base Remote Facility 43B using Big Bob's Lumber Lounge in Akron, Ohio as a front. He is approached by Agent Castillo, who informs him that the Hulk has returned from the dead and they need his help to kill him. The Leader accepts, but stabs Agent Castillo, stating that he would rather do it himself. The Leader arrives at the area where the Hulk and [[Weapon H]] are fighting each other, until Shadow Base agents led by Agent NG catch up to him. As the Hulk starts sneezing, the Leader states to Agent NG that he infected Clayton Cortez with a gamma-altering virus. Arriving where Weapon H had knocked the Hulk unconscious, the Leader begs for Weapon H to finish him off. When the Leader threatens his family as part of Plan C, he detonates some bombs near Weapon H in order to get away. Clayton chases after the Leader until [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] arrives.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>The Leader brings out the Humanoids, only to be regressed back to their pods by reverse-engineered Humanoids when former [[Weapon X]] Project scientist Dr. Aliana Alba shows up. She advises the Leader to leave the disposal of Wolverine to her. After a brief fight, the Leader explains that he was pursuing the Hulk, while Dr. Alba states that she was pursuing Wolverine. They come to a conclusion that they were manipulated by [[Minotaur (comics)|someone who wants Weapon H dead]]. This leads to them making plans to capture the Hulk in order to collaborate on a project. The Leader and Dr. Alba later attack Shadow Base's Remote Facility FN34.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the larger Humanoid abducts Wolverine and Bruce Banner, it brings them to Shadow Base's Remote Facility FN34 as they begin the experiment that gives the Hulk the claws of Wolverine and Wolverine the strength of the Hulk. The Leader and Dr. Alba unleash the mutated Hulk and Wolverine on Shadow Base Auto-Op WMD Facility BX91 in Central, Ohio using Green Energy Corp as a front. Weapon H arrives and lures them towards the Leader and Dr. Alba. When Weapon H destroys the remote-control in the Leader's hand, Dr. Alba withdraws the nanobots that were placed in Wolverine and Bruce Banner and places them in Weapon H. It does not work on Weapon H, as the Leader repairs his teleporter enough to get himself and Dr. Alba away from Weapon H. After watching the aftermath from afar, the Leader and Dr. Alba share a romantic kiss as they embrace each other.<ref>''Hulkverines'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Leader has superhuman [[Mind|mental]] acumen, as a result of his exposure to an explosion of gamma-irradiated waste. He is capable of knowledge and comprehension that is beyond the human ability to understand. The potential of his intelligence is nearly unlimited, being capable of mastering every worldly subject and adopting concepts completely foreign to his environment. His higher brain functions, including pattern recognition, information storage and retrieval, and logical and philosophical structuring have been enhanced to inhuman levels. He also has total recall of every event he has witnessed since the accident that transformed him and can calculate possibilities and outcomes so accurately that it borders on predicting the future. Despite his limitless intelligence and supreme knowledge, his effectiveness is greatly hampered by his own arrogance, immaturity, and obsession with defeating the Hulk, which constantly causes him to lose sight of necessary details and act prematurely, causing the ruin of his schemes. His egotism has also led him to embark on two mad, impractical schemes to turn the rest of humanity into green-skinned beings like himself.\n\nAfter the Leader revived himself after his near-death exposure to the Watcher's Ultimate Machine, he has unlocked previously latent telekinetic and telepathic powers within him.{{issue|date=February 2019}} He is able to control the minds of ordinary humans by touching them (aside from gamma-mutated individuals like the Hulk or the Abomination), wipe memories of several humans at once, create illusions to trick others or disguise himself, and project telekinetic blasts potent enough to topple a very weakened Hulk.\n\nThe Leader is also a technological genius that specializes in gamma radiation. He has created a large array of technology far beyond human ability, including vehicles, weaponry, computers, androids, and synthetic lifeforms, personal weapons such as laser pistols, pulse weapons, and kinetic gauntlets, and is particularly adept at genetic engineering and manipulating radiation for many nefarious purposes. The Leader also has an army of synthetic henchmen at his disposal called \"Humanoids\", created by the Leader and which have served him throughout his career of world domination, mainly as bodyguards, soldiers, and lab servants. They have versatile programming capacities to allow them to perform any task, do not tire or need sustenance, and have elastic-like bodies that make them immune to blunt impacts. The Humanoids are usually controlled directly through the Leader's own mental commands, but can also be pre-programmed to carry out a certain directive. The Leader has also developed gamma bombs, shield generators to cover large areas, cages for holding the Hulk, teleportation devices, android duplicates, a means of controlling the minds of the Hulk or the Rhino through devices,<ref name=\"Incredible Hulk #157-159\"/><ref name=\"Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #75-76\"/> a Revivo-Beam which was designed to restore him to life in the event of his death,<ref name=\"Incredible115\">''Incredible Hulk'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref> and Omnivac,{{issue|date=November 2018}} a sentient computer that maintains the space station he has used as a base of operations.\n\nOn occasion, the Leader showed the ability to turn himself back into Samuel Sterns, but this ability resulted in him losing all memory of his identity as the Leader as Stern's mind was ill-equipped to cope with the Leader's intellect (although he always remembered everything when he turned back into the Leader again).\n\n==Other versions==\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in===\nPrior to the release of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' in 2012, Marvel ran a series of canon tie-in comics entitled ''[[Fury's Big Week|Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week]]'', which take place within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. In issues #6-7, Sterns is seen undergoing a rapid head mutation just as he is discovered by [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)#Film|Natasha Romanoff]] who stumbles upon him immediately after the Hulk has escaped (which happens during the climax of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', while the Hulk is fighting the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]). Although his brainpower has already drastically increased to the point where he can pinpoint the exact location of the Black Widow's birth just by a brief hint of [[Stalingrad]] in her accent, Natasha shoots him in the leg when he attempts to bribe her by offering to help her return to her home and he is detained into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody.<ref>''The Avengers Prelude: Fury's Big Week'' #6-7 (March 2012).

In the Ultimate universe, Wisdom is an ex-British Intelligence agent thrown out of the organization after testing his \"British Enhancile Program\" on himself, transforming him into the Leader.<ref>''Ultimate Human'' #1 (January 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref> Wisdom has psychic and mental abilities similar to the original Leader, but requires a wheelchair and a [[Halo (medicine)|halo]] brace to support the weight of his enlarged cranium. The Leader attempts to steal Tony Stark's nanotechnology, as Banner and Stark work together to try to incorporate it into Banner's physiology in the hopes that it will grant him control over his transformations into the Hulk. When Stark commands a decoy Iron-Tech robot into the base of the Leader, Banner transforms into the Hulk. The Hulk resists the Leader's influence, and pounds him into the ground.

He is served by the [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]], the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], the [[Ogress (comics)|Ogress]], and the Gamma Warriors (who were created from the Hulk's DNA). In this version, the Leader's origin is changed to link with the Hulk's. Samuel Stern was one of the scientists working on the gamma bomb, but sabotaged the bomb's test; when Rick Jones was trapped on the site, Bruce Banner ran out to save him and was transformed into the Hulk. Shortly afterwards, Stern fell into a pit of radioactive waste left from the gamma bomb, which mutated him into the Leader.\n* The Leader cameos in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' episode \"Tremble at the Might of MODOK\". He is shown at a convention of evil geniuses.\n* The Leader appears in ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episodes \"Hulk vs. the World\", \"The Breakout: Part 1\" \"Gamma World\" (parts 1 and 2), and \"Assault on Prison 42\", voiced by [[Jeffrey Combs]].

His mind and MODOK's mind end up attacking Spider-Man, the Iron Spider, and Agent Venom. Upon agreeing to free them, Spider-Man wants them to work the teleporter machine to get all the civilian hostages back to Earth. The Leader and MODOK work the teleporter, while the others fought the Grandmaster. As the final civilians are being evacuated, the Leader and MODOK took the opportunity to get teleported out of the Grandmaster's ship.\n* The Leader appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Ultron Revolution]]'', voiced again by James Arnold Taylor.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the episode \"Building the Perfect Weapon\", he works on his plans to make the perfect weapon by stealing A.I.M. technology. When the Avengers and the Red Hulk show up, the Leader unleashes [[Ultimo (Marvel Comics)|Ultimo]] on them, while he gets away. When at an offshore island, the Leader makes it so that the Red Hulk gets caught by the traps that the Avengers have a hard time getting through. The Leader lures the Red Hulk into a room that contained a particle-accelerator gamma bomb, which he will use on the Red Hulk. After the Red Hulk fails to disarm the bomb and is caught in the explosion, the Leader appears before the Avengers stating that he created the perfect weapon, as an enlarged Red Hulk appears near him. In the episode \"World War Hulk\", the Leader loses control of the Red Hulk and is beaten into a state of unconsciousness. In the two-part episode \"Avengers No More\", the Leader steals the prototype Arc Reactor and some Vibranium from the Wakandan Consulate, which leads him into conflict with the Avengers. When they catch him, he summons a new incarnation of the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] consisting of [[Arnim Zola]], the [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]], and [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Using the stolen Vibranium and Arc Reactor prototype, the Leader builds the Static Expander to immobilize the Avengers in order to send them across time and space. When the Black Panther returns with the reserve members, the Leader is defeated where he asks the Cabal to help him. Arnim Zola and the Enchantress tell him that he is not the Cabal's \"true leader\", as the Cabal gets away. After the Avengers are scattered across time and space, the Black Panther's group takes the Leader into their custody.\n* The Leader appears in the ''[[Marvel Future Avengers]]'' anime series, voiced by [[Yoshihito Sasaki]] in Japanese and [[Benjamin Diskin]] in English.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Film===\n* Dr. Samuel Sterns appears in the film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'', portrayed by [[Tim Blake Nelson]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2593169/tim-blake-nelson-will-battle-hulk-as-the-leader-in-incredible-hulk-2-with-or-without-ed-norton/ |title=Tim Blake Nelson Will Battle Hulk As 'The Leader' In 'Incredible Hulk 2' \u2014 With Or Without Ed Norton |last=Carroll |first=Larry |date=November 21, 2008 |website=[[MTV]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EdVqkyUK?url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2008/11/21/tim-blake-nelson-will-battle-hulk-as-the-leader-in-incredible-hulk-2-with-or-without-ed-norton/ |archive-date=February 23, 2013 |access-date=November 21, 2008}}</ref> In this film, he is a [[Harlem]] based university professor trying to help Bruce Banner find a cure for his transformations, while operating under the alias of \"Mr. Blue\".

They are the second of the [[Indian Railways WCAM class|WCAM series]]. They use the same motors as [[WCAM 1]] but with different circuitry and gearing. They are operational in routes around Mumbai. MU operation was possible with 3 units. WCAM-2P was the passenger oriented version of WCAM-2 class. However they perform better than [[WCAM 1]] series. Same as [[WCAM 1]] class they also performed poorly in DC mode compared to AC mode. They were also used for hauling trains away from the DC section of suburban trains to AC section and performed the same task as the WCAM-1 did. WCAM-2 locos had the same traction motors, as the WCAM-1 locos, but different circuitry and gearing. The bogies are somewhat different from those of the WCAM-1 being fabricated trimount Co-Co bogies with secondary suspension. Rated speed 105&nbsp;km/h in DC mode and 120&nbsp;km/h in AC mode. (In trials by [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] the loco is said to had been run at speeds up to 135&nbsp;km/h in AC mode). Almost all of these were dual-braked, but all are now equipped with air brakes only. All the WCAM-1's and -2's were homed at [[Electric Loco Shed, Valsad|Valsad]] shed in Gujarat. Many of CR's WCAM-2 locos were not used much in DC zones (exceptions were the CR / Bombay Port Trust's Wadala marshalling yard a portion of which has DC traction, and for hauling the Punjab Mail in the late 1990s) as they delivered very poor performance in DC mode and on CR's heavy grades. Although these locos have the same traction motors as the [[WAM 4]] and [[WCAM 1]], the power output from the WCAM-2 locos is higher than for the WAM-4 and WCAM-1 because in those models the traction motors were underfed (3460kVA transformer in contrast to the 5400kVA transformer for WCAM-2) and did not yield their potential maximum power. Under AC traction, the WCAM-2 locos operate with all six motors in parallel (this has been enforced by modifications to these locos), while in DC mode they also operate in the all-series and series-parallel (2S 3P, i.e., three series-pairs of motors in parallel) configurations. Recent WCAM-2's from BHEL, including the passenger-specific version <strong>WCAM-2P</strong>, were rated 2900&nbsp;hp in DC mode and 4700&nbsp;hp in AC mode (max. speed 120&nbsp;km/h in AC mode). These were used by WR and CR for fast trains, running at up to 120&nbsp;km/h. CR had tried the WCAM-2 and WCAM-2P units but found them usable only with speed restrictions. Some WCAM-2P units had only air brakes. With the WCAM-2 locos, MU operation was possible with up to 3 (4?) units. Some (all?) of the WCAM-2 locos were originally leased to IR, ownership remaining with BHEL, the manufacturers.\n\n==Technical specifications<ref name=IRFCA>[http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco-electric-dc.html#WCAM-2 WCAM-2] at Indian Railways Fan Club</ref>==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Manufacturers\n|[[Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited]]\n|-\n|Traction Motors\n|TAO 659 ({{convert|575|kW|abbr=on}}, 750 V).

By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents.\n\nSmith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]]. By 1817, he had moved with his family to the [[burned-over district]] of western New York; an area of intense religious revivalism during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including [[First Vision|one]] in 1820 during which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ), and another in 1823 in which [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book of [[golden plates]] inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], calling it a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\" or \"Mormons\", and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. They first gathered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] and established an outpost in [[Independence, Missouri]] which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. The collapse of the church-sponsored [[Kirtland Safety Society]] Anti-Banking Company and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where he became a spiritual and political leader.

By the time of his death, 14 years later, he had attracted tens of thousands of followers and founded a religion that continues to the present with millions of global adherents.\n\nSmith was born in [[Sharon, Vermont]]. By 1817, he had moved with his family to the [[burned-over district]] of western New York; an area of intense religious revivalism during the [[Second Great Awakening]]. Smith said he experienced a series of visions, including [[First Vision|one]] in 1820 during which he saw \"two personages\" (presumably God the Father and Jesus Christ), and another in 1823 in which [[Angel Moroni|an angel]] directed him to a buried book of [[golden plates]] inscribed with a Judeo-Christian history of an ancient American civilization. In 1830, Smith published what he said was an English translation of these plates called the Book of Mormon. The same year he organized the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]], calling it a [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of the early Christian church. Members of the church were later called \"Latter Day Saints\" or \"Mormons\", and Smith announced a revelation in 1838 which renamed the church as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nIn 1831, Smith and his followers moved west, planning to build a communalistic American [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. They first gathered in [[Kirtland, Ohio]] and established an outpost in [[Independence, Missouri]] which was intended to be Zion's \"center place\". During the 1830s, Smith sent out missionaries, published revelations, and supervised construction of the [[Kirtland Temple]]. The collapse of the church-sponsored [[Kirtland Safety Society]] Anti-Banking Company and violent skirmishes with non-Mormon Missourians caused Smith and his followers to establish a new settlement at [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], where he became a spiritual and political leader. In 1844, when the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' criticized Smith's power and practice of polygamy, Smith and the Nauvoo city council ordered the destruction of their printing press, inflaming anti-Mormon sentiment.<ref name=\"historyOfLDS-council\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=pGi-iiz6juYC&pg=PA430&lpg=PA432 ''History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''] volume VI (1912), pp. 430-432.</ref>  Fearing an invasion of Nauvoo, Smith rode to [[Carthage, Illinois]] to stand trial, but was killed when [[Death of Joseph Smith|a mob stormed the jailhouse]].\n\nSmith published many revelations and other texts that his followers regard as scripture. His teachings discuss the nature of God, cosmology, family structures, political organization, and religious collectivism. His followers regard him as a prophet comparable to [[Moses]] and [[Elijah]], and several religious denominations consider themselves the continuation of the church that he organized, including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and the [[Community of Christ]].\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early years (1805\u201327)===\n{{Main|Early life of Joseph Smith}}\nSmith was born on December 23, 1805 in [[Sharon, Vermont]] to [[Lucy Mack Smith]] and her husband [[Joseph Smith Sr.|Joseph Sr.]], a merchant and farmer.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|pp=9, 30}}</ref><ref>{{Harvtxt|Smith|1832|p=1}}</ref> Modern DNA testing of Smith's relatives suggests that his family were of Irish descent, as he carried a rare [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] marker within Haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] which is found almost entirely in people of Northwestern Irish descent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perego|first=Ugo A.|last2=Myres|first2=Natalie M.|last3=Woodward|first3=Scott R.|date=2005|title=Reconstructing the Y-Chromosome of Joseph Smith: Genealogical Applications|jstor=23289931|journal=Journal of Mormon History|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|location=Champaign, Illinois|volume=31|issue=2|pages=42\u201360}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|first=Michael|last=De Groote|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/700249298/DNA-shows-Joseph-Smith-was-Irish.html|title=DNA shows Joseph Smith was Irish|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|date=August 8, 2008|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.fairmormon.org/conference/august-2008/joseph-smith-dna-revealed-new-clues-from-the-prophets-genes|title=Joseph Smith DNA Revealed: New Clues from the Prophet's Genes - FairMormon|work=FairMormon|access-date=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSmith suffered a crippling bone infection when he was seven and, after receiving surgery, used crutches for three years.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Bushman|2005|p=21}}.</ref> The family moved to the western New York village of [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]] in 1816\u201317, after an ill-fated business venture and three years of crop failures, and they eventually took a mortgage on a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Smith Family Farm|farm]] in the nearby town of [[Manchester, New York|Manchester]].
