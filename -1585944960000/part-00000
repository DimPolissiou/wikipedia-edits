The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E.

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout.

Brigid is depicted alongside a [[bovine|calf]], Patrick with a [[shamrock]] in his right hand, and Columcille alongside two flying [[doves]].

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}<ref>Lawrence, Marion. \"Ships, Monsters and Jonah\".

The chapel was designed in 1914, with the building completed in 1916 and was fully furnished by 1917. The church's architecture and interior fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a proponent of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and statuettes, its floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely instructed the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in the construction, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style into the design of the chapel.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}, with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who  died in August 1913.

He sought not just to contravene to the 1908 act, but to construct a chapel that was \"something more than merely sufficient...a church designed and fashioned on the same lines and on the same plan as those which their forefathers had built for their priests and missioners all over Ireland nearly a thousand years ago.\"{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} O'Connell, who became a priest in 1929 after the death of his wife, disliked the contemporary, international, approach to church building, which he described as \"machine made\", preferring a localised and uniquely Irish approach to style and form, which he sought from the most skilled available local craftsmen.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}} He aspired that work on the chapel was \"carried out in Cork, by Cork labour and with materials obtained from the City or County of Cork\".{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\nO'Connell was assisted by Windle, who was then University president.

O'Connell rejected international and industrial production methods, seeking a return a smaller scale, more personalised, craft.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=20}}{{sfn|Leland|2004}} While his main inspiration for the building was early medieval architecture, a number of recently built churches in [[County Cork]] informed his choices, in particular [[Timoleague]]'s parish church and the chapel in [[Gougane Barra]].{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=612}}\n\n[[File:Honan interior 1.jpg|upright=0.8|thumb|The nave, looking west towards the main entrance]]\nThe chapel's architectural style is Celtic-Romanesque.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=164}} Its interior has a very simple outlay,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=291}}  consisting of four areas; the main entrance, nave, chancel and nunnery.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=167}} Unusually the chapel does not contain [[aisle]]s or [[transept]]s, and the six-bay {{sfn|NIAH|2000}} rectangular [[nave]] is rather plain.{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}} Compared to the decorative and sculpted elements of the chapel, the architecture is austere and modest.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} Functionally, the chapel lacks shrines where people could light candles or place flowers near devotional images, making it similar to a Protestant rather than a Catholic church.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=25}} Its round bell-tower (''[[campanile]]'') and circular-plan are inspired by the [[Irish round tower|round towers]] found in Irish [[monastic settlement]]s from the 9th century.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} \n\nThe main entrance is on the western side, and approached via double-hinged [[wrought iron]] gates.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} The doorway is capped by three limestone [[Rib vault|ribbed]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaults]],{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=292}} supported by [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] containing [[relief]]s of the heads of six [[Munster]] saints: Finnbarr of Cork, [[Colman mac Duagh|Coleman of Cloyne]]; [[St. Gobnait]] of [[Ballyvourney]]; [[Brendan]] of [[County Kerry|Kerry]], [[Decl\u00e1n of Ardmore]] and [[\u00cdte of Killeedy]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=40}} Each figure was later represented in the stained glass windows.

They included zig-zag patterns in [[lozenge]] and saltire, continuous dots and [[Chevron (geology)|chevron]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=55, 56}}\n\nThe chapel's design contravened the requirements of the 1962 [[Second Vatican Council]] (Vatican II) in two aspects. Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to the subject's \"trickster\" [[Paganism|pagan]] powers\" than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio, where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was commercially successful and often competing against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned above the altar, on the east gable.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours appropriate to his strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the base of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=2010-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design,{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212}} and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and resurrection, as Jesus rose from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time.

Over the next few decades, great progress was made in building up the health sector, with the training of doctors and the creation of many health facilities. Today, Algeria has an established network of hospitals (including university hospitals), clinics, medical centres and small health units or dispensaries. While equipment and medicines may not always be the latest available, staffing levels are high and the country has one of the best healthcare systems in Africa. Access to health care is enhanced by the requirement that doctors and dentists work in [[public health]] for at least five years. The government provides [[universal health care]].\n\n===Cape Verde===\n{{Main|Health in Cape Verde}}\n\nMedical facilities in [[Cape Verde]] are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are hospitals in [[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]], with smaller medical facilities in other places.  The islands of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands.  Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service.<ref name=us>[[United States Department of State]], [https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html \"Cape Verde: Country Specific Information\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125120707/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html# |date=25 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Eritrea===\n{{Main|Health in Eritrea}}\n\nEritrea is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for health. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified the high prioritisation of health and education both within the government and amongst Eritreans at home and abroad. Innovative multi-sectoral approaches to health were also identified with the success. About one-third of the population lives in extreme [[poverty]], and more than half survives on less than US$1 per day.  Health care and welfare resources generally are believed to be poor, although reliable information about conditions is often difficult to obtain. In 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the Eritrean government spent 5.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]] on national health accounts. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that in 2004 there were only three physicians per 100,000 people in [[Eritrea]]. The two-year war with [[Ethiopia]], coming on the heels of a 30-year struggle for independence, negatively affected the health sector and the general welfare. The rate of prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]), in Eritrea is believed to be at 0.7%(2012)which is reasonably low. In the decade since 1995, impressive results have been achieved in lowering maternal and [[child mortality]] rates and in immunizing children against childhood diseases. In 2008 average life expectancy was slightly less than 63 years, according to the WHO. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995\u20132002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). This has helped to some small extent even out rural-urban and rich-poor inequity in health.\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Ethiopia}}\n{{See also|Health in Ethiopia}}\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult [[literacy]], and [[infant mortality rate]]s. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|1998\u20132000 war with Eritrea]], but in the years since, outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000\u20132001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The [[physician]] to population ratio was 1:48,000, the [[nurse]] to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. These ratios have since shown some improvement. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varies from limited to nonexistent. As of the end of 2003, the [[United Nations]] (UN) reported that 4.4 percent of adults were infected with [[human immunodeficiency virus]]/[[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS); other estimates of the rate of infection ranged from a low of 7 percent to a high of 18 percent. Whatever the actual rate, the [[HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia|prevalence of HIV/AIDS]] has contributed to falling life expectancy since the early 1990s. According to the [[Ministry of Health (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Health]], one-third of current young adult deaths are AIDS-related. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread, especially among children, as is [[food insecurity]]. Because of growing population pressure on agricultural and pastoral land, [[soil degradation]], and severe [[drought]]s that have occurred each decade since the 1970s, per capita [[food production]] is declining. According to the UN and the [[World Bank]], Ethiopia at present suffers from a structural food deficit such that even in the most productive years, at least 5 million Ethiopians require food relief.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn 2002 the government embarked on a [[poverty reduction]] program that called for outlays in education, health, [[sanitation]], and water. A [[polio]] [[vaccination]] campaign for 14 million children has been carried out, and a program to [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettle]] some 2 million subsistence farmers is underway. In November 2004, the government launched a five-year program to expand primary health care. In January 2005, it began distributing [[antiretroviral drugs]], hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Ghana===\n{{Main|Health in Ghana}}\n\nIn [[Ghana]], most health care is provided by the government, but hospitals and clinics run by religious groups also play an important role.  Some for-profit clinics exist, but they provide less than 2% of health services.  Health care is very variable through the country.  The major urban centres are well served, but rural areas often have no modern health care.  Patients in these areas either rely on traditional medicine or travel great distances for care. In 2005, Ghana spent 6.2% of GDP on health care, or US$30 per capita. Of that, approximately 34% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===Guinea===\n{{Main|Health in Guinea}}\n\n[[Guinea]] has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of [[primary health care]] to the population, including community ownership and local budgeting, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of drugs and other essential health care resources.<ref>Knippenberg R et al.

Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62\u201365 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation's villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nMali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. In 2001 general government expenditures on health constituted 6.8 percent of total general government expenditures and 4.3 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), totaling only about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate. Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, especially outside of [[Bamako]], and medicines are in short supply. There were only 5 [[physicians]] per 100,000 inhabitants in the 1990s and 24 hospital beds per 100,000 in 1998. In 1999 only 36 percent of Malians were estimated to have access to health services within a five-kilometer radius.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Morocco===\n{{Main|Health in Morocco}}\n\nAccording to the United States government, [[Morocco]] has inadequate numbers of [[physicians]] (0.5 per 1,000 people) and hospital beds (1.0 per 1,000 people) and poor access to [[water]] (82 percent of the population) and [[sanitation]] (75 percent of the population). The health care system includes 122 hospitals, 2,400 health centers, and 4 university clinics, but they are poorly maintained and lack adequate capacity to meet the demand for medical care. Only 24,000 beds are available for 6 million patients seeking care each year, including 3 million emergency cases.

The [[Politics of Nigeria|federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, while the state government manages the various [[hospital|general hospitals]] and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]]. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18</ref> A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide food sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970 to 1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1\u201318</ref> Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's importation of food products. Historically, health insurance in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: government-paid health care provided and financed for all citizens, health care provided by government through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101\u2013102</ref> However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses government employees, the organized [[private sector]] and the informal sector. Legislative wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.<ref>Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of [[Nigeria]]', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415\u2013427</ref>\n\n===Senegal===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Senegal}}\n{{See also|Health in Senegal}}\n\nThe health budget in Senegal has tripled between 1980 and 2000, leading to the Senegalese people leading healthier and longer lives \u2013 the life expectancy at birth is approximately 55.34 years for men, 58.09 years for women, and 56.69 years for the entire population. Also, the prevalence rate of AIDS in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at 0.9%. However, large disparities still exist in Senegal's health coverage, with 70% of doctors, and 80% of pharmacists and dentists, living in the nation's capital city, Dakar.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{Main|Healthcare in South Africa}}\n{{See also|Health in South Africa}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], parallel private and public systems exist.  The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed.  The wealthiest 20% of the population uses the private system and are far better served.  This division in substantial ways perpetuates racial inequalities created in the pre-apartheid segregation era and apartheid era of the 20th century. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===Sudan===\n{{Main|Health in Sudan}}\n\nOutside urban areas, little health care is available in [[Sudan]], helping account for a relatively low average [[life expectancy]] of 57 years and an [[infant mortality]] rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, low by standards in Middle Eastern but not African countries. For most of the period since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced [[civil war]], which has diverted resources to military use that otherwise might have gone into health care and training of professionals, many of whom have migrated in search of more gainful employment. In 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that there were only 9 doctors per 100,000 people, most of them in regions other than the South. Substantial percentages of the population lack access to safe water and sanitary facilities. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread outside the central Nile corridor because of population displacement from war and from recurrent droughts; these same factors together with a scarcity of medicines make diseases difficult to control. Child immunization against most major childhood diseases, however, had risen to approximately 60 percent by the late 1990s from very low rates in earlier decades. Spending on health care is quite low \u2013 only 1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1998 (latest data). The [[United Nations]] placed the rate of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]) infection in late 2003 at 2.3 percent for adults, quite low by regional standards. The United Nations suggested, however, that the rate could be as high as 7.2 percent. Between 400,000 and 1.3 million adults and children were living with HIV, and AIDS deaths numbered 23,000. As of late 2004, some 4 million persons in the South had been internally displaced and more than 2 million had died or been killed as a result of two decades of war. Comparable figures for [[Darfur]] were 1.6 million displaced and 70,000 dead since fighting began there in early 2003.<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Sudan.pdf Sudan country profile].

The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.\n\nArgentina has three sectors. The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions.  There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources for all Obras Sociales schemes and the monthly average a beneficiary receives varies from $5\u201380 per month.<ref name=\"idrc\">IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013649/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html# |date=9 June 2011 }}.</ref>  MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities.  Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)|Argentina's economic crisis of 2001]], the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose).  In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.<ref name=\"Barrientos\">Armando Barrientos \"Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile\" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420</ref> The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.<ref name=\"idrc\"/>\n\nPrivate insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors.  According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina's private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[Market (economics)|market]] in recent years.  This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.<ref name=\"idrc\"/> The public system serves those not covered by Obras Sociales or private insurance schemes. It also provides [[emergency department|emergency services]].  According to above-mentioned IRBC report, Argentina's public system exhibits serious structural deterioration and managerial inefficiency; a high degree of administrative centralization at the [[Provinces of Argentina|provincial level]]; rigidity in its staffing structure and labour relationships; no adequate system of incentives; inadequate information systems on which to base decision-making and control; serious deficits in facilities and equipment maintenance; and a system of management ill-suited to its size. The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often [[primary care]] is even under the purview of local townships.  Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase.  According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8 were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes.<ref name=\"Barrientos\"/>\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Brazil}}\n{{See also|Health in Brazil}}\n\nThe Brazilian health system is composed of a large, public, government managed system, the SUS ([[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]), which serves the majority of the population completely free of charge or any form of fee, and a private sector, managed by health insurance funds and private entrepreneurs.\n\nThe public health system, SUS, was established in 1988 by the Brazilian Constitution, and sits on 3 basic principles of universality, comprehensiveness and equity. Universality states that all citizens must have access to health care services, without any form of discrimination, regarding skin color, income, social status, gender or any other variable. There is no form of charging or payment in any public hospitals or clinics, either for Brazilian nationals or foreigners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/brazil/healthcare/health-system|title=Healthcare System in Brazil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nGovernment standards state that citizen's health is the result of multiple variables, including employment, income, access to land, sanitation services, access and quality of health services, education, psychic, social and family conditions, and are entitled to full and complete health care, comprising prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Equity states that health policies should be oriented towards the reduction of inequalities between population groups and individuals, being the most needed the ones for whom policies should be first directed.\n\nSUS also has guidelines for its implementation, the most peculiar being popular participation, which defines that all policies are to be planned and supervised directly by the population, through local, city, state and national health councils and conferences.\n\nThe level of public spending is particularly high in relation to GDP for a country of Brazil's income level and in comparison with its emerging-market peers. Government outlays on health care alone account for nearly 9% of GDP, the second largest item of spending following social protection. In health care, a number of conventional output indicators are not out of step with OECD averages. Following the decentralization of service delivery in the early 1990s, increasing emphasis has appropriately been placed on enhancing preventive care. But, in a decentralized setting, cost-effectiveness depends a great deal on the ability of service deliverers to exploit economies of scale and scope. Experience with inter-municipal initiatives for procurement, as well as flexible arrangements for hospital administration and human-resource management, is by and large positive.\n\nPrivate Health Insurance is widely available in Brazil and may be purchased on an individual-basis or obtained as a work benefit (major employers usually offer private health insurance benefits). Public health care is still accessible for those who choose to obtain private health insurance. As of March 2007, more than 37 million Brazilians had some sort of private health insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |title=Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Sa\u00fade Suplementar  |publisher=ANS TABNET|date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810061941/http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Health care in Canada}}\n{{See also|Health in Canada}}\n\n[[Canada]] has a federally sponsored, publicly funded [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system. Most services are provided by the public sector, and the remainder are provided by the private sector.\n\n;Political responsibility\nThe Medicare system spans the federal and provincial governments and funding flows from the federal governments to the provinces to administer. The country's prime minister and most provincial premiers say they are committed to the [[Social Union Framework Agreement]] that promotes \"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility\" in health care.<ref>Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, \"[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999].\"</ref> Retrieved 20 December 2006.\n\n;GDP\nIn 2005, Canada spent 9.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,463 per capita.  Of that, approximately 70% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n;Services and costs\nCanada's system is a [[single-payer system]], where basic services are provided by private doctors. Hospitals provide additional services as well as community health clinics, and private clinics. Costs are paid for by the government for many services, but other services can be covered by private health plans that many employers offer as benefits. Some provinces still charge premiums to individuals and families. As well, some hospitals charge minimal user fees for [[emergency department]] visits.\n\n;Private sector involvement\nOther areas of health care, such as [[dentistry]] and [[optometry]], are wholly private, although in some provinces, emergency visits to optometrists are partly covered by medicare. Some provinces also allow private services which replicate those that are publicly offered, such as diagnostic services such as ultrasounds, x-Rays, and MRI. \nAs well, many private companies acting as benefits or medical insurance providers have flourished.\n\n;Doctor billings\nBilling by doctors is complex and varies from province to province. In 1984, the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. Each province may opt out, though none currently choose to. Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province's medical associations, usually on an annual basis.  A physician cannot charge a fee for a service that is higher than the negotiated rate \u2013 even to patients who are not covered by the publicly funded system \u2013 unless he or she opts out of billing the publicly funded system altogether.\n\n;Pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by government price controls.\n\n;Improvement of the Canadian healthcare system\nIn May 2011, the Health Council released a report entitled: \"Progress Report 2011: Health Care Renewal in Canada\", which provides a pan-Canadian look at five key commitments of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal<ref name=2003accord>{{cite web|title=2003 First Ministers Accord on Health Care Renewal|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071254/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|archivedate=6 August 2011}}</ref> and the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care.<ref name=10yrplan>{{cite web|title=A 10-year plan to strengthen health care|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819164453/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|archivedate=19 August 2011}}</ref> This report highlights the progress being achieved to date on wait times, pharmaceuticals management, electronic health records, teletriage, and health innovation.\n\n===Chile===\n{{main|Healthcare in Chile}}\n\n[[Chile]] has maintained a dual health care system in which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a universal income tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/179/12/1289.pdf|title=untitled<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Colombia===\n{{main|Health care in Colombia}}\n\n===Costa Rica===\n{{Main|Health care in Costa Rica}}\n\n[[Costa Rica]] provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents.\n\n===Cuba===\n{{Main|Health care in Cuba}}\n{{See also|Health in Cuba}}\n\nHealth care in [[Cuba]] consists of a government-coordinated system that guarantees universal coverage and consumes a lower proportion of the nation's GDP (7.3%) than some highly privatised systems (e.g. USA: 16%) (OECD 2008). The system does charge fees in treating elective treatment for patients from abroad, but tourists who fall ill are treated free in Cuban hospitals. Cuba attracts patients mostly from [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]] by offering care of comparable quality to a developed nation but at much lower prices. Cuba's own health indicators are the best in Latin America and surpass those of the US in some respects (infant mortality rates, underweight babies, HIV infection, immunisation rates, doctor per population rates). (UNDP 2006: Tables 6,7,9,10) In 2005, Cuba spent 7.6% of GDP on health care, or US$310 per capita. Of that, approximately 91% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n=== El Salvador ===\n{{Main|Health in El Salvador}}\n\nHealthcare in El Salvador is free at the point of delivery. The public health system, which is regulated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has 30 public hospitals in the country plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. According to the law of El Salvador, all individuals are given basic health services in public health institutions.\n\n===Mexico===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Mexico}}\n\n[[File:IMSSbuildingDF.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Central offices of the [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]] in downtown [[Mexico City]].]]\n\n[[File:HOSPITAL LA RAZA DEL I.

Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the [[free-market]] system (e.g. it is available to those who can afford it). Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government and the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS).\n\nAdvances in medicine and increasing health knowledge have increased the life expectancy in [[Mexico]] by an average of 25 years in the last years of the 20th century. Of the 6.6% [[GDP]] of government revenue spent on health, this provides only health insurance to 40% of the population who are privately employed. The health care system has three components: the social security institute, governmental services for the un-insured (Seguro Popular), and the private sector that is financed almost completely from out of pocket money. The [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], the largest social institution in Latin America, is the governmental institution responsible of executing the Federal Government's health policy. The number of public hospitals in Mexico has increased 41% in ten years from 1985 to 1995.\n\nAccording to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital.

The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as [[Chagas' disease]], run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, [[malnutrition]], lack of proper health care, and poor [[sanitation]] are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Paraguay.pdf Paraguay country profile].

Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13\u201320 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors.

The service provision aspect of public health care has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access government-paid health care at public health care facilities where health insurance is not required. The health care system in the country is universal as almost all citizens utilise the services provided. Some, though, opt for private health care facilities for their ailments.\n\nRecently, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has launched CDAP (Chronic Disease Assistance Programme). The Chronic Disease Assistance Programme provides citizens with government-paid prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical items to combat several health conditions.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Health care in the United States}}\n{{See also|Health care reform in the United States|Health in the United States}}\n[[File:US Healthcare Spending.GIF|frame|right|U.S. healthcare spending.{{update after|2011}} Percent of GDP.

[[Health care reform in the United States]] usually focuses around three suggested systems, with proposals currently underway to integrate these systems in various ways to provide a number of health care options. First is [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]], a term meant to describe a single agency managing a single system, as found in many other developed countries as well as some states and municipalities within the United States. Second are employer or individual insurance mandates. Finally, there is consumer-driven health, in which systems, consumers, and patients have more control of how they access care. Over the past thirty years, most of the nation's health care has moved from the second model operating with not-for-profit institutions to the third model operating with for-profit institutions.\n\nIn the US, the social and political issues surrounding access to health care have led to vigorous public debate and the almost colloquial use of terms such as health care (medical management of illness), [[health insurance]] (reimbursement of health care costs), and [[public health]] (the collective state and range of health in a population). In the US, 12% to 16% of the citizens do not have health insurance. State boards and the Department of Health regulate inpatient care to reduce the national health care deficit. To tackle the problems of the increasing number of uninsured, and costs associated with the US health care system, President [[Barack Obama]] says he favors the creation of a universal health care system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|title=The Time Has Come for Universal Health Care |accessdate=30 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226054555/http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|archivedate=26 December 2008}}</ref> However, this view is not shared across the country (see, for example, quotes from ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion columnist [[Paul Krugman]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/opinion/04krugman.html|title=Clinton, Obama, Insurance|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 February 2008 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> and [[Factcheck.org]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Jess Henig |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141829 |title=Obama's Inflated Health Savings |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>).\n\nA few states have taken serious steps toward universal health care coverage, most notably [[Minnesota]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], with recent examples being the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcare/i/MassHealthIns.htm |title=About.com's Pros & Cons of Massachusetts' Mandatory Health Insurance Program |publisher=Usliberals.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> and Connecticut's [[SustiNet]] plan to provide quality, affordable health care to state residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |accessdate=21 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017010420/http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |archivedate=17 October 2009 |title=In Historic Vote, Legislature Overrides SustiNet Veto}}</ref>\nThe state of Oregon and the city of San Francisco are both examples of governments that adopted universal healthcare systems for strictly fiscal reasons.\n\nThe United States is alone among developed nations in not having a [[universal health care]] system; the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] provides a nationwide [[health insurance exchange]] that came to fruition in 2014, but this is not universal in the way similar countries mean it.<ref>[http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |date=23 April 2018 }}.</ref> Healthcare in the U.S. does, however, have significant publicly funded components.

The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the health care system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70\u201380% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.<ref>\"The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties.\" Authors: Carrin G.1; Ron A.; Hui Y.; Hong W.; Tuohong Z.; Licheng Z.; Shuo Z.; Yide Y.; Jiaying C.; Qicheng J.; Zhaoyang Z.; Jun Y.; Xuesheng L.

In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the \"rural collective health system\" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year [[medical school]]s. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Healthcare in India}}\n{{See also|Health in India}}\n\nIn India, the hospitals are run by government, charitable trusts and by private organizations. The government hospitals in rural areas are called [[Primary Health Centre]]s (PHCs). Major hospitals are located in district headquarters or major cities. Apart from the modern system of medicine, traditional and indigenous medicinal systems like [[Ayurvedic]] and [[Unani]] systems are in practice throughout the country. The modern system of medicine is regulated by the [[Medical Council of India]], whereas the alternative systems recognised by Government of India are regulated by the Department of [[AYUSH]] (an acronym for [[Ayurveda]], [[Yoga]], [[Unani]], [[Siddha]] & [[Homeopathy]]) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health, Government of India]]. PHCs are non-existent in most places, due to poor pay and scarcity of resources. Patients generally prefer private health clinics. These days some of the major corporate hospitals are attracting patients from neighboring countries such as [[Pakistan]], countries in the [[Middle East]] and some [[Europe]]an countries by providing quality treatment at low cost.

The country's health care system is divided between public and private institutions. In the public sector, the Ministry of Health operates 1,245 primary health care centers and 27 hospitals, accounting for 37 percent of all hospital beds in the country; the military's Royal Medical Services runs 11 [[hospital]]s, providing 24 percent of all beds; and the [[Jordan University Hospital]] accounts for 3 percent of total beds in the country.

However, [[bribes]] often are necessary to obtain needed care. The quality of health care, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, has declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of [[physician|doctors]] per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15 percent, to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46 percent, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4 percent in 2010. A compulsory [[health insurance]] system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system. The health system is in crisis in rural areas such as the [[Aral Sea]] region, where health is most affected by [[pollution]].<ref name=autogenerated10>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Kazakhstan.pdf Kazakhstancountry profile].

Over the last couple of years they have increased their efforts to overhaul the systems and attract more foreign investment.\n\nThere is still a shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists. As a result, certain medical care and treatment is available only in large cities.

About 19 percent of the population is [[malnourished]] \u2013 a higher rate than the 17 percent average for developing countries \u2013 and 30 percent of children under age five are malnourished. Leading causes of sickness and death include [[gastroenteritis]], [[respiratory infections]], [[congenital abnormalities]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], and [[typhoid fever]]. The [[United Nations]] estimates that in 2003 Pakistan's [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) prevalence rate was 0.1 percent among those 15\u201349, with an estimated 4,900 deaths from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a major health concern, and both the government and religious community are engaging in efforts to reduce its spread. In 2003 there were 68 physicians for every 100,000 persons in Pakistan. According to 2002 government statistics, there were 12,501 health institutions nationwide, including 4,590 dispensaries, 906 [[hospitals]] with a total of 80,665 hospital beds, and 550 rural health centers with a total of 8,840 beds. According to the [[World Health Organization]], Pakistan's '''total health expenditures''' amounted to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) in 2001, and per capita health expenditures were US$16. The government provided 24.4 percent of total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main|Health care in the Philippines}}\n{{See also|Health in the Philippines}}\n\nIn 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physician]]s, or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospital]]s, of which about 40 percent were government-run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).

Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a [[universal health care]] system, and co-exists with private health care system. [[Infant mortality]] rate: in 2006 the crude birth rate stood at 10.1 per 1000, and the crude death rate was also one of the lowest in the world at 4.3 per 1000. In 2006, the total fertility rate was only 1.26 children per woman, the 3rd lowest in the world and well below the 2.10 needed to replace the population. Singapore was ranked 6th in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000.\n\n[[Singapore]] has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.<ref name=\"WHOSIS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm |title=World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> Singapore currently has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/entity/whosis/whostat2007_1mortality.pdf \"World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality\"], based on 2005 data.</ref> Singapore has \"one of the most successful health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm [[Watson Wyatt Worldwide|Watson Wyatt]].<ref name=\"Watson Wyatt Singapore\"/> Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \"actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to replicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.<ref name=\"Watson Wyatt Singapore\">John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 \"The Singapore health system \u2013 achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=19 April 2010 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.</ref>\n\nSingapore's well-established health care system comprises a total of 13 private hospitals, 10 public (government) hospitals and several specialist clinics, each specializing in and catering to different patient needs, at varying costs.\n\nPatients are free to choose the providers within the government or private health care delivery system and can walk in for a consultation at any private clinic or any government polyclinic. For emergency services, patients can go at any time to the 24-hour Accident & Emergency Departments located in the government hospitals.\n\nSingapore's medical facilities are among the finest in the world, with well qualified doctors and dentists, many trained overseas.\n\nSingapore has [[medical savings account]] system known as [[Medisave]].\n\n===Syria===\n{{Main|Health in Syria}}\n\nThe [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Ba'ath Party]] has placed an emphasis on [[health care]], but funding levels have not been able to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2001. Syria's health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general [[hospital]]s (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; [[hospital bed]]s totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 [[physician]]s, 3,362 [[dentist]]s, and 14,816 [[nurse]]s and [[midwive]]s; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria's health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tartus]], and [[Latakia]].<ref name=autogenerated6>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile].

NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.<ref>Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 \"New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits\"], ''Taiwan Journal, 2 January 2004'' Accessed 28 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 |date=6 June 2008 }}</ref> NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.\n\nAccording to [[T.R. Reid]], Taiwan achieves \"remarkable efficiency\", costing \u22486 percent of GDP [[universal health care|universal coverage]]; however, this underestimates the cost as it is not fully funded and the government is forced to borrow to make up the difference. \"And frankly, the solution is fairly obvious: increase the spending a little, to maybe 8 percent of GDP. Of course, if Taiwan did that, it would still be spending less than half of what America spends.\"<ref name=trr>[[T.R.

[[Universal health care]] is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the Universal Coverage scheme theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in these programs, though most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH) oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the Universal Coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion\nFoundation (\"ThaiHealth\"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care.\n\n===Turkmenistan===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Turkmenistan}}\n{{See also|Health in Turkmenistan}}\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 [[Turkmenistan]] had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov]]\u2019s 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] intensified this trend. [[Physicians]] are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply. In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Government-paid public health care was abolished in 2004.<ref name=autogenerated15>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf Turkmenistan country profile].

According to the UAE government, total expenditures on health care from 1996 to 2003 were US$436 million. According to the [[World Health Organization]], in 2004 total expenditures on health care constituted 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and the per capita expenditure for health care was US$497. Health care currently is government-paid only for UAE citizens. Effective January 2006, all residents of [[Abu Dhabi]] are covered by a new comprehensive health insurance program; costs will be shared between employers and employees. The number of [[physician|doctors]] per 100,000 (annual average, 1990\u201399) is 181. The UAE now has 40 public hospitals, compared with only seven in 1970. The Ministry of Health is undertaking a multimillion-dollar program to expand health facilities \u2013 hospitals, medical centers, and a trauma center \u2013 in the seven emirates. A state-of-the-art general hospital has opened in Abu Dhabi with a projected bed capacity of 143, a trauma unit, and the first home health care program in the UAE. To attract wealthy UAE nationals and expatriates who traditionally have traveled abroad for serious medical care, Dubai is developing [[Dubai Healthcare City]], a hospital free zone that will offer international-standard advanced private health care and provide an academic medical training center; completion is scheduled for 2010.<ref name=autogenerated13>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates country profile].

Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian [[emigration]] in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], [[anesthetics]], and [[antibiotics]] are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to [[government-paid health care|free health care]], in the post-Soviet era [[bribery]] has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.<ref name=autogenerated12>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf Uzbekistan country profile].

However, [[malnutrition]] is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and [[infant mortality]] rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals\u2019 own pockets.<ref name=autogenerated9>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile].

After reunification in 1976, this system was extended to the South. Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to [[water supply]] and [[sewage]] systems. As a result, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]]. Inadequate funding also has contributed to a shortage of [[nurses]], [[midwives]], and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the [[World Bank]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Yemen===\n{{Main|Health in Yemen}}\n\nDespite the significant progress [[Yemen]] has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped.

According to the [[World Bank]], the number of [[physician|doctors]] in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons.

A person must have adequate coverage through either the state or private insurance. In the state ''mutuelle/mutualiteit'' scheme a person has the ability to choose any doctor, clinic or hospital in any location without referral, according to the patient's needs in much the same way as with private insurance.\n\n====Doctors====\nGeneral practitioners can be found in private practices or attached to clinics and hospitals. A person is free to consult or register with any of their own choosing.  Similarly with specialist consultants. Reimbursements are available for those with insurance, either private or public. If a patient is on a private scheme, or is uninsured, the fee is payable in full at the time of the appointment. The patient then brings, mails or deposits the receipt to his insurance mutuality which then immediately repays the amount.\n\nThe majority of dentists in Belgium are private, though there are those who accept part-payment on state insurance.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAs with general practitioners, patients can arrange to see a specialist of their choice at any hospital. Those going into hospital for a planned stay need to take personal care items (such as a towel, soap etc.) with them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115045216/http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |archivedate=15 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Brussels]], the eleven big public hospitals are organized under the Iris association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iris-hopitaux.be/|title=H\u00f4pitaux du r\u00e9seau Iris Bruxelles|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Complementary health care====\nThe Ministry of Health recognizes [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] as reimbursable alternative treatments.

To enroll, a person must first join a health insurance fund ''mutuelle'' (''mutualit\u00e9'') or ''ziekenfonds'' (''mutualiteit'') for which an employer's certificate is required if the employer is to contribute to the cost. If employed a person's contributions is automatically deducted from salary. The employer will also pay a contribution. Health insurance funds will reimburse medical costs. The choice of mutual insurer is up to the individual. Most of them are affiliated to a religious or political institution but there is no real difference between them because reimbursement rates are fixed by the Belgian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&table_name=wet&cn=1994071438|title=LOI|publisher=WET|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInsurance funds do not always cover the full costs of treatment and typical reimbursement is between half to three-quarters of a typical doctors or specialists visit. A deciding factor here depends on one's job. From people who are unemployed or disabled, receiving other benefits or business-owners receive somewhat less.  There is also a ''\"yearly maximum bill\"'' meaning that someone who has paid a certain amount to their doctor/hospital within the year does not have to make any further payment. From this point, any extra is returned from the patient's insurance. In general, the poor, even without reaching the necessary sum, do not pay anything.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230110/https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |archivedate=10 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nInsured persons have a standardized credit card style SIS-card<ref>[[:nl:SIS-kaart]], Retrieved 2010-05-01{{Circular reference|date=August 2015}}</ref> which is needed in pharmacies and hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcss.fgov.be/nl/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/legislation/legislation_04.html|title=Site has moved  |publisher=CBSS \u2013 Crossroads Bank for Social Security|accessdate=30 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306035452/https://www.bcss.fgov.be/nl/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/legislation/legislation_04.html|archivedate=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Health in Bulgaria}}\n\n[[Bulgaria]] began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the [[communist]] era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on communist-era public [[clinic]]s while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the [[National Health Insurance Fund]] (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary health care costs. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of [[Salary|salaries]], with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private [[physician]]s. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the [[European Union]] (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and [[paramedic]]al training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system's long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of [[physician|doctors]] but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main|Health care in Denmark}}\n\nDenmark's health care system has retained the same basic structure since the early 1970s. The administration of hospitals and personnel is dealt with by the Ministry of the Interior, while primary care facilities, health insurance, and community care are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Anyone can go to a physician for no fee and the public health system entitles each Dane to his/her own doctor. Expert medical/surgical aid is available, with a qualified nursing staff. Costs are borne by public authorities, but high taxes contribute to these costs. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.4 physicians and 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The number of hospital beds, like that in other EU countries, has undergone a major decline since 1980, from around 40,000 to about 23,000 in 1998/99. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients has contributed significantly to this trend. The ratio of doctors to population, by contrast, has increased during this period.\n\nThe total fertility rate in 2000 was 1.7, while the maternal mortality rate was 10 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. Studies show that between 1980 and 1993, 63% of married women (ages 15 to 49) used contraception. As of 2002 cardiovascular diseases and cancer were the leading causes of death. Denmark's cancer rates were the highest in the European Union. In 1999, there were only 12 reported cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. As of 1999, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4,300 and deaths from AIDS that year were estimated at less than 100. HIV prevalence was 0.17 per 100 adults.\n\nDanish citizens may choose between two systems of primary health care: medical care paid for by the government provided by a doctor whom the individual chooses for a year and by those specialists to whom the doctor refers the patient; or complete freedom of choice of any physician or specialist at any time, with state reimbursement of about two-thirds of the cost for medical bills paid directly by the patient. Most Danes opt for the former. All patients receive subsidies on pharmaceuticals and vital drugs; everyone must pay a share of dental bills. As of 1999, total health care expenditure was estimated at 8.4% of GDP.\n\nResponsibility for the public hospital service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, each of which is allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed medical health officers, responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999.\n\n===Estonia===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Estonia}}\n\nHealthcare in Estonia is supervised by the [[Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs|Ministry of Social Affairs]] and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Finland}}\n\nIn [[Finland]], public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 78% by [[taxation]], 20% by patients through access charges, and by others 2%. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits are (\u20ac11 per visit with annual \u20ac33 cap), hospital outpatient treatment (\u20ac22 per visit), a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines (\u20ac26 per 24 hours, or \u20ac12 if in a psychiatric hospital). After a patient has spent \u20ac590 per year on public medical services, all treatment and medications thereafter are paid for by the government. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. Patients can claim re-imbursement of part of their prescription costs from [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]]. Finland also has a much smaller private medical sector which accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Private sector patients can claim a contribution from KELA towards their private medical costs (including [[dentistry]]) if they choose to be treated in the more expensive private sector, or they can join private insurance funds. However, private sector health care is mainly in the primary care sector. There are virtually no private hospitals, the main hospitals being either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). In 2005, Finland spent 7.5% of GDP on health care, or US$2,824 per capita. Of that, approximately 78% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Health care in France}}\n\nIn its [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|2000 assessment of world health systems]], the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the \"best overall health care\" in the world.<ref name=\"WHO2000\"/> In 2005, France spent 11.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,926 per capita. Of that, approximately 80% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\nIn [[France]], most doctors remain in private practice; there are both [[Private sector|private]] and [[public hospital|public]] [[hospital]]s. Social Security consists of several public organizations, distinct from the state government, with separate budgets that refunds patients for care in both private and public facilities. It generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them [[nonprofit]], [[mutual insurer]]s, to the point that the word \"{{ill|mutuelle|fr|Mutuelle de sant\u00e9 en France|vertical-align=sup}}\" (mutual) has come to be a synonym of supplemental private insurer in common language.\n\nUntil recently, social security coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers, unemployed or retirees), excluding some few poor segments of the population; the government of [[Lionel Jospin]] put into place the \"universal health coverage\" allowing the entire French population to benefit from Health care. In some systems, patients can also take private health insurance but choose to receive care at public hospitals, if allowed by the private [[insurer]]. For serious illness, regardless of the insurance regime, the national health system will assume the cost of long-term remedial treatment.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Health in Germany}}\n[[File:UniKlinik (Freiburg) 4.jpg|thumb|The [[University Medical Center Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]]]\n\n[[Germany]] has a universal multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: Public \"law-enforced\" health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung), and private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung)\n.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |archive-date=23 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134435/http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2006 }}</ref> Those who make below a certain income must use the public health insurance.

There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nAll persons resident in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are entitled to health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the [[Health Service Executive]] and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are however paid for by the government, as well as health care of infants under 6 months of age.

For example, most adults use private dental care, whereas the public system only treats people, for a normal fee, when they have free capacity. Health-related plastic surgery (like burn damage) is covered by the public system, while cosmetic surgery in general is private. There are a number of private psychologists, there are also some private general practice doctors and specialists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nPublic health care is financed by a special-purpose income tax on the order of 8\u201311%, loosely translated as \"public benefits fee\" (Norwegian: \"trygdeavgift og Folketrygden\"). This can be considered a mandatory public insurance, covering not only health care but also loss of income during sick leave, public pension, unemployment benefits, benefits for single parents and a few others. The system is supposed to be self-financing from the taxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNorwegian citizens living in Norway are automatically covered, even if they never had taxable income.

Though the public systems dominate, private health care and a wide variety of alternative and complementary treatments are available for those who have private health insurance or are willing to pay directly themselves.\n\nOne difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently abolished, or are in the process of abolishing, all prescription charges, while England (with the exception of [[birth control pills]], which are paid for by the state) continues to charge patients who are between 18 and 60 years old a fixed prescription fee of \u00a38.40 per item, unless they are exempt because of certain medical conditions (including cancer) or are on low income. Since health care delivery is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems], [[BBC]], 2 January 2008</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Health care in Australia}}\n\nIn [[Australia]] the current system, known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], was instituted in 1984.

Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] on health care, or US$3,181 per capita.  Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/data/Search.jsp |title=WHO Statistical Information System |accessdate=2008-09-23 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Health care in New Zealand}}\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] hospitals are public and treat citizens or permanent residents, with the fees paid by the government, and are managed by [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]]. Under the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] coalition governments (1999\u20132008), there were plans to make [[primary health care]] available with charges paid for by the government. At present government subsidies exist in health care. The cost of visiting a GP ranges from government-paid to $45.00 for children and from government-paid to $75.00 for adults under the current subsidies. This system is funded by taxes. The New Zealand government agency [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency|Pharmac]] subsidizes certain pharmaceuticals depending upon their category. Co-payments exist, however these are lower if the user has a ''Community Services Card'' or ''High User Health Card''. In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tobacco_politics|Tobacco control laws by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Africa topic|Health care in}}\n{{Americas topic|Health care in}}\n{{Asia topic|Health care in}}\n{{Europe topic|Health care in}}\n{{Oceania topic|Health care in}}\n{{Population country lists}}\n\n[[Category:Health by country| ]]\n[[Category:Health insurance by country]]\n", "text_old": "{{see also|Health system|Health care|Universal health coverage by country|Category:Health by country}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Life Expectancy OECD 2013.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Life Expectancy of the total population at birth from 2000 until 2011 among several OECD member nations.

Over the next few decades, great progress was made in building up the health sector, with the training of doctors and the creation of many health facilities. Today, Algeria has an established network of hospitals (including university hospitals), clinics, medical centres and small health units or dispensaries. While equipment and medicines may not always be the latest available, staffing levels are high and the country has one of the best healthcare systems in Africa. Access to health care is enhanced by the requirement that doctors and dentists work in [[public health]] for at least five years. The government provides [[universal health care]].\n\n===Cape Verde===\n{{Main|Health in Cape Verde}}\n\nMedical facilities in [[Cape Verde]] are limited, and some medicines are in short supply or unavailable.  There are hospitals in [[Praia]] and [[Mindelo]], with smaller medical facilities in other places.  The islands of [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]] and [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] no longer have functioning airports so air evacuation in the event of a medical emergency is nearly impossible from these two islands.  Brava also has limited inter-island ferry service.<ref name=us>[[United States Department of State]], [https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html \"Cape Verde: Country Specific Information\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125120707/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1083.html# |date=25 January 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Eritrea===\n{{Main|Health in Eritrea}}\n\nEritrea is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for health. Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have identified the high prioritisation of health and education both within the government and amongst Eritreans at home and abroad. Innovative multi-sectoral approaches to health were also identified with the success. About one-third of the population lives in extreme [[poverty]], and more than half survives on less than US$1 per day.  Health care and welfare resources generally are believed to be poor, although reliable information about conditions is often difficult to obtain. In 2001, the most recent year for which figures are available, the Eritrean government spent 5.7 percent of [[gross domestic product]] on national health accounts. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimated that in 2004 there were only three physicians per 100,000 people in [[Eritrea]]. The two-year war with [[Ethiopia]], coming on the heels of a 30-year struggle for independence, negatively affected the health sector and the general welfare. The rate of prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV]]/[[AIDS]]), in Eritrea is believed to be at 0.7%(2012)which is reasonably low. In the decade since 1995, impressive results have been achieved in lowering maternal and [[child mortality]] rates and in immunizing children against childhood diseases. In 2008 average life expectancy was slightly less than 63 years, according to the WHO. Immunisation and child nutrition has been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the underweight prevalence among children decreased by 12% in 1995\u20132002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%). This has helped to some small extent even out rural-urban and rich-poor inequity in health.\n\n===Ethiopia===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Ethiopia}}\n{{See also|Health in Ethiopia}}\n\nThroughout the 1990s, the government, as part of its reconstruction program, devoted ever-increasing amounts of funding to the social and health sectors, which brought corresponding improvements in school enrollments, adult [[literacy]], and [[infant mortality rate]]s. These expenditures stagnated or declined during the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War|1998\u20132000 war with Eritrea]], but in the years since, outlays for health have grown steadily. In 2000\u20132001, the budget allocation for the health sector was approximately US$144 million; health expenditures per capita were estimated at US$4.50, compared with US$10 on average in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000 the country counted one hospital bed per 4,900 population and more than 27,000 people per primary health care facility. The [[physician]] to population ratio was 1:48,000, the [[nurse]] to population ratio, 1:12,000. Overall, there were 20 trained health providers per 100,000 inhabitants. These ratios have since shown some improvement. Health care is disproportionately available in urban centers; in rural areas where the vast majority of the population resides, access to health care varies from limited to nonexistent. As of the end of 2003, the [[United Nations]] (UN) reported that 4.4 percent of adults were infected with [[human immunodeficiency virus]]/[[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (HIV/AIDS); other estimates of the rate of infection ranged from a low of 7 percent to a high of 18 percent. Whatever the actual rate, the [[HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia|prevalence of HIV/AIDS]] has contributed to falling life expectancy since the early 1990s. According to the [[Ministry of Health (Ethiopia)|Ministry of Health]], one-third of current young adult deaths are AIDS-related. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread, especially among children, as is [[food insecurity]]. Because of growing population pressure on agricultural and pastoral land, [[soil degradation]], and severe [[drought]]s that have occurred each decade since the 1970s, per capita [[food production]] is declining. According to the UN and the [[World Bank]], Ethiopia at present suffers from a structural food deficit such that even in the most productive years, at least 5 million Ethiopians require food relief.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn 2002 the government embarked on a [[poverty reduction]] program that called for outlays in education, health, [[sanitation]], and water. A [[polio]] [[vaccination]] campaign for 14 million children has been carried out, and a program to [[Resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia|resettle]] some 2 million subsistence farmers is underway. In November 2004, the government launched a five-year program to expand primary health care. In January 2005, it began distributing [[antiretroviral drugs]], hoping to reach up to 30,000 HIV-infected adults.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Ghana===\n{{Main|Health in Ghana}}\n\nIn [[Ghana]], most health care is provided by the government, but hospitals and clinics run by religious groups also play an important role.  Some for-profit clinics exist, but they provide less than 2% of health services.  Health care is very variable through the country.  The major urban centres are well served, but rural areas often have no modern health care.  Patients in these areas either rely on traditional medicine or travel great distances for care. In 2005, Ghana spent 6.2% of GDP on health care, or US$30 per capita. Of that, approximately 34% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===Guinea===\n{{Main|Health in Guinea}}\n\n[[Guinea]] has been reorganizing its health system since the [[Bamako Initiative]] of 1987 formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of [[primary health care]] to the population, including community ownership and local budgeting, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of drugs and other essential health care resources.<ref>Knippenberg R et al.

Mali's health and development indicators rank among the worst in the world. In 2000 only 62\u201365 percent of the population was estimated to have access to safe drinking water and only 69 percent to sanitation services of some kind; only 8 percent was estimated to have access to modern sanitation facilities. Only 20 percent of the nation's villages and livestock watering holes had modern water facilities.<ref name=autogenerated5>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Mali.pdf Mali country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (January 2005). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nMali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. In 2001 general government expenditures on health constituted 6.8 percent of total general government expenditures and 4.3 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), totaling only about US$4 per capita at an average exchange rate. Medical facilities in Mali are very limited, especially outside of [[Bamako]], and medicines are in short supply. There were only 5 [[physicians]] per 100,000 inhabitants in the 1990s and 24 hospital beds per 100,000 in 1998. In 1999 only 36 percent of Malians were estimated to have access to health services within a five-kilometer radius.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Morocco===\n{{Main|Health in Morocco}}\n\nAccording to the United States government, [[Morocco]] has inadequate numbers of [[physicians]] (0.5 per 1,000 people) and hospital beds (1.0 per 1,000 people) and poor access to [[water]] (82 percent of the population) and [[sanitation]] (75 percent of the population). The health care system includes 122 hospitals, 2,400 health centers, and 4 university clinics, but they are poorly maintained and lack adequate capacity to meet the demand for medical care. Only 24,000 beds are available for 6 million patients seeking care each year, including 3 million emergency cases.

The [[Politics of Nigeria|federal government]]'s role is mostly limited to coordinating the affairs of the [[university]] [[teaching hospital]]s, while the state government manages the various [[hospital|general hospitals]] and the [[local government]] focus on [[dispensaries]]. The total expenditure on health care as % of GDP is 4.6, while the percentage of federal government expenditure on health care is about 1.5%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 18</ref> A [[long run]] indicator of the ability of the country to provide food sustenance and avoid [[malnutrition]] is the rate of growth of per capita food production; from 1970 to 1990, the rate for Nigeria was 0.25%.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 1\u201318</ref> Though small, the positive rate of per capita may be due to Nigeria's importation of food products. Historically, health insurance in Nigeria can be applied to a few instances: government-paid health care provided and financed for all citizens, health care provided by government through a special health insurance scheme for government employees and private firms entering contracts with private health care providers.<ref>Ronald J. Vogel; Financing Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa Greenwood Press, 1993. pp 101\u2013102</ref> However, there are few people who fall within the three instances. In May 1999, the government created the [[National Health Insurance]] Scheme, the scheme encompasses government employees, the organized [[private sector]] and the informal sector. Legislative wise, the scheme also covers children under five, permanently disabled persons and prison inmates. In 2004, the administration of Obasanjo further gave more legislative powers to the scheme with positive amendments to the original 1999 legislative act.<ref>Felicia Monye; 'An Appraisal of the National Health Insurance Scheme of [[Nigeria]]', Commonwealth Law Bulletin, 32:3 415\u2013427</ref>\n\n===Senegal===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Senegal}}\n{{See also|Health in Senegal}}\n\nThe health budget in Senegal has tripled between 1980 and 2000, leading to the Senegalese people leading healthier and longer lives \u2013 the life expectancy at birth is approximately 55.34 years for men, 58.09 years for women, and 56.69 years for the entire population. Also, the prevalence rate of AIDS in Senegal is one of the lowest in Africa, at 0.9%. However, large disparities still exist in Senegal's health coverage, with 70% of doctors, and 80% of pharmacists and dentists, living in the nation's capital city, Dakar.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{Main|Healthcare in South Africa}}\n{{See also|Health in South Africa}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], parallel private and public systems exist.  The public system serves the vast majority of the population, but is chronically underfunded and understaffed.  The wealthiest 20% of the population uses the private system and are far better served.  This division in substantial ways perpetuates racial inequalities created in the pre-apartheid segregation era and apartheid era of the 20th century. In 2005, South Africa spent 8.7% of GDP on health care, or US$437 per capita. Of that, approximately 42% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===Sudan===\n{{Main|Health in Sudan}}\n\nOutside urban areas, little health care is available in [[Sudan]], helping account for a relatively low average [[life expectancy]] of 57 years and an [[infant mortality]] rate of 69 deaths per 1,000 live births, low by standards in Middle Eastern but not African countries. For most of the period since independence in 1956, Sudan has experienced [[civil war]], which has diverted resources to military use that otherwise might have gone into health care and training of professionals, many of whom have migrated in search of more gainful employment. In 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that there were only 9 doctors per 100,000 people, most of them in regions other than the South. Substantial percentages of the population lack access to safe water and sanitary facilities. [[Malnutrition]] is widespread outside the central Nile corridor because of population displacement from war and from recurrent droughts; these same factors together with a scarcity of medicines make diseases difficult to control. Child immunization against most major childhood diseases, however, had risen to approximately 60 percent by the late 1990s from very low rates in earlier decades. Spending on health care is quite low \u2013 only 1 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 1998 (latest data). The [[United Nations]] placed the rate of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[HIV/AIDS]]) infection in late 2003 at 2.3 percent for adults, quite low by regional standards. The United Nations suggested, however, that the rate could be as high as 7.2 percent. Between 400,000 and 1.3 million adults and children were living with HIV, and AIDS deaths numbered 23,000. As of late 2004, some 4 million persons in the South had been internally displaced and more than 2 million had died or been killed as a result of two decades of war. Comparable figures for [[Darfur]] were 1.6 million displaced and 70,000 dead since fighting began there in early 2003.<ref name=autogenerated7>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Sudan.pdf Sudan country profile].

The Ministry of Health and Social Action (MSAS), oversees all three subsectors of the health care system and is responsible for setting of regulation, evaluation and collecting statistics.\n\nArgentina has three sectors. The public sector is funded and managed by Obras Sociales, umbrella organizations for Argentine worker's unions.  There are over 300 Obras Sociales in Argentina, each chapter being organized according to the occupation of the beneficiary. These organizations vary greatly in quality and effectiveness. The top 30 chapters hold 73% of the beneficiaries and 75% of resources for all Obras Sociales schemes and the monthly average a beneficiary receives varies from $5\u201380 per month.<ref name=\"idrc\">IDRC ''Reshaping Health Care in Latin America''http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609013649/http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-35159-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html# |date=9 June 2011 }}.</ref>  MSAS has established a Solidarity Redistribution Fund (FSR) to try to address these beneficiary inequities.  Only workers employed in the formal sector are covered under Obras Sociales insurance schemes and after [[Argentine economic crisis (1999\u20132002)|Argentina's economic crisis of 2001]], the number of those covered under these schemes fell slightly (as unemployment increased and employment in the [[informal sector]] rose).  In 1999, there were 8.9 million beneficiaries covered by Obras Sociales.<ref name=\"Barrientos\">Armando Barrientos \"Reforming Health Insurance in Argentina and Chile\" ''Health Policy and Planning'' 15(4): 420</ref> The private health care sector in Argentina is characterized by great heterogeneity and is made up of a great number of fragmented facilities and small networks; it consists of over 200 organizations and covers approximately 2 million Argentines.<ref name=\"idrc\"/>\n\nPrivate insurance often overlaps with other forms of health care coverage, thus it is difficult to estimate the degree to which beneficiaries are dependent on the public and private sectors.  According to a 2000 report by the IRBC, foreign [[Competition (economics)|competition]] has increased in Argentina's private sector, with [[Switzerland|Swiss]], American and other [[Latin America]]n [[health care provider]]s entering the [[Market (economics)|market]] in recent years.  This has been accompanied by little formal regulation.<ref name=\"idrc\"/> The public system serves those not covered by Obras Sociales or private insurance schemes. It also provides [[emergency department|emergency services]].  According to above-mentioned IRBC report, Argentina's public system exhibits serious structural deterioration and managerial inefficiency; a high degree of administrative centralization at the [[Provinces of Argentina|provincial level]]; rigidity in its staffing structure and labour relationships; no adequate system of incentives; inadequate information systems on which to base decision-making and control; serious deficits in facilities and equipment maintenance; and a system of management ill-suited to its size. The public system is highly decentralized to the provincial level; often [[primary care]] is even under the purview of local townships.  Since 2001, the number of Argentines relying on public services has seen an increase.  According to 2000 figures, 37.4% of Argentines had no health insurance, 48.8 were covered under Obras Sociales, 8.6% had private insurance, and 3.8% were covered by both Obras Sociales and private insurance schemes.<ref name=\"Barrientos\"/>\n\n===Brazil===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Brazil}}\n{{See also|Health in Brazil}}\n\nThe Brazilian health system is composed of a large, public, government managed system, the SUS ([[Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade]]), which serves the majority of the population completely free of charge or any form of fee, and a private sector, managed by health insurance funds and private entrepreneurs.\n\nThe public health system, SUS, was established in 1988 by the Brazilian Constitution, and sits on 3 basic principles of universality, comprehensiveness and equity. Universality states that all citizens must have access to health care services, without any form of discrimination, regarding skin color, income, social status, gender or any other variable. There is no form of charging or payment in any public hospitals or clinics, either for Brazilian nationals or foreigners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/brazil/healthcare/health-system|title=Healthcare System in Brazil|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nGovernment standards state that citizen's health is the result of multiple variables, including employment, income, access to land, sanitation services, access and quality of health services, education, psychic, social and family conditions, and are entitled to full and complete health care, comprising prevention, treatment and rehabilitation. Equity states that health policies should be oriented towards the reduction of inequalities between population groups and individuals, being the most needed the ones for whom policies should be first directed.\n\nSUS also has guidelines for its implementation, the most peculiar being popular participation, which defines that all policies are to be planned and supervised directly by the population, through local, city, state and national health councils and conferences.\n\nThe level of public spending is particularly high in relation to GDP for a country of Brazil's income level and in comparison with its emerging-market peers. Government outlays on health care alone account for nearly 9% of GDP, the second largest item of spending following social protection. In health care, a number of conventional output indicators are not out of step with OECD averages. Following the decentralization of service delivery in the early 1990s, increasing emphasis has appropriately been placed on enhancing preventive care. But, in a decentralized setting, cost-effectiveness depends a great deal on the ability of service deliverers to exploit economies of scale and scope. Experience with inter-municipal initiatives for procurement, as well as flexible arrangements for hospital administration and human-resource management, is by and large positive.\n\nPrivate Health Insurance is widely available in Brazil and may be purchased on an individual-basis or obtained as a work benefit (major employers usually offer private health insurance benefits). Public health care is still accessible for those who choose to obtain private health insurance. As of March 2007, more than 37 million Brazilians had some sort of private health insurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |title=Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Sa\u00fade Suplementar  |publisher=ANS TABNET|date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810061941/http://www.ans.gov.br/portal/site/informacoesss/informacoesss.asp |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\n{{Main|Health care in Canada}}\n{{See also|Health in Canada}}\n\n[[Canada]] has a federally sponsored, publicly funded [[Medicare (Canada)|Medicare]] system. Most services are provided by the public sector, and the remainder are provided by the private sector.\n\n;Political responsibility\nThe Medicare system spans the federal and provincial governments and funding flows from the federal governments to the provinces to administer. The country's prime minister and most provincial premiers say they are committed to the [[Social Union Framework Agreement]] that promotes \"comprehensiveness, universality, portability, public administration and accessibility\" in health care.<ref>Government of Canada, Social Union, News Release, \"[http://socialunion.gc.ca/news/020499_e.html A Framework to Improve the Social Union for Canadians: An Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Governments of the Provinces and Territories, February 4, 1999].\"</ref> Retrieved 20 December 2006.\n\n;GDP\nIn 2005, Canada spent 9.8% of GDP on health care, or US$3,463 per capita.  Of that, approximately 70% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n;Services and costs\nCanada's system is a [[single-payer system]], where basic services are provided by private doctors. Hospitals provide additional services as well as community health clinics, and private clinics. Costs are paid for by the government for many services, but other services can be covered by private health plans that many employers offer as benefits. Some provinces still charge premiums to individuals and families. As well, some hospitals charge minimal user fees for [[emergency department]] visits.\n\n;Private sector involvement\nOther areas of health care, such as [[dentistry]] and [[optometry]], are wholly private, although in some provinces, emergency visits to optometrists are partly covered by medicare. Some provinces also allow private services which replicate those that are publicly offered, such as diagnostic services such as ultrasounds, x-Rays, and MRI. \nAs well, many private companies acting as benefits or medical insurance providers have flourished.\n\n;Doctor billings\nBilling by doctors is complex and varies from province to province. In 1984, the [[Canada Health Act]] was passed, which prohibited extra billing by doctors on patients while at the same time billing the public insurance system. Each province may opt out, though none currently choose to. Most family doctors receive a fee per visit. These rates are negotiated between the provincial governments and the province's medical associations, usually on an annual basis.  A physician cannot charge a fee for a service that is higher than the negotiated rate \u2013 even to patients who are not covered by the publicly funded system \u2013 unless he or she opts out of billing the publicly funded system altogether.\n\n;Pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceutical costs are set at a global median by government price controls.\n\n;Improvement of the Canadian healthcare system\nIn May 2011, the Health Council released a report entitled: \"Progress Report 2011: Health Care Renewal in Canada\", which provides a pan-Canadian look at five key commitments of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal<ref name=2003accord>{{cite web|title=2003 First Ministers Accord on Health Care Renewal|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806071254/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2003accord/index-eng.php|archivedate=6 August 2011}}</ref> and the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care.<ref name=10yrplan>{{cite web|title=A 10-year plan to strengthen health care|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|publisher=Health Canada|accessdate=5 August 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819164453/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/delivery-prestation/fptcollab/2004-fmm-rpm/index-eng.php|archivedate=19 August 2011}}</ref> This report highlights the progress being achieved to date on wait times, pharmaceuticals management, electronic health records, teletriage, and health innovation.\n\n===Chile===\n{{main|Healthcare in Chile}}\n\n[[Chile]] has maintained a dual health care system in which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a universal income tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/179/12/1289.pdf|title=untitled<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Colombia===\n{{main|Health care in Colombia}}\n\n===Costa Rica===\n{{Main|Health care in Costa Rica}}\n\n[[Costa Rica]] provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents.\n\n===Cuba===\n{{Main|Health care in Cuba}}\n{{See also|Health in Cuba}}\n\nHealth care in [[Cuba]] consists of a government-coordinated system that guarantees universal coverage and consumes a lower proportion of the nation's GDP (7.3%) than some highly privatised systems (e.g. USA: 16%) (OECD 2008). The system does charge fees in treating elective treatment for patients from abroad, but tourists who fall ill are treated free in Cuban hospitals. Cuba attracts patients mostly from [[Latin America]] and [[Europe]] by offering care of comparable quality to a developed nation but at much lower prices. Cuba's own health indicators are the best in Latin America and surpass those of the US in some respects (infant mortality rates, underweight babies, HIV infection, immunisation rates, doctor per population rates). (UNDP 2006: Tables 6,7,9,10) In 2005, Cuba spent 7.6% of GDP on health care, or US$310 per capita. Of that, approximately 91% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n=== El Salvador ===\n{{Main|Health in El Salvador}}\n\nHealthcare in El Salvador is free at the point of delivery. The public health system, which is regulated by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, has 30 public hospitals in the country plus various primary care facilities and 27 basic health care systems. According to the law of El Salvador, all individuals are given basic health services in public health institutions.\n\n===Mexico===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Mexico}}\n\n[[File:IMSSbuildingDF.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Central offices of the [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]] in downtown [[Mexico City]].]]\n\n[[File:HOSPITAL LA RAZA DEL I.

Health care delivered through private health care organizations operates entirely on the [[free-market]] system (e.g. it is available to those who can afford it). Public health care delivery, on the other hand, is accomplished via an elaborate provisioning and delivery system put in place by the Mexican Federal Government and the [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS).\n\nAdvances in medicine and increasing health knowledge have increased the life expectancy in [[Mexico]] by an average of 25 years in the last years of the 20th century. Of the 6.6% [[GDP]] of government revenue spent on health, this provides only health insurance to 40% of the population who are privately employed. The health care system has three components: the social security institute, governmental services for the un-insured (Seguro Popular), and the private sector that is financed almost completely from out of pocket money. The [[Mexican Social Security Institute|IMSS]], the largest social institution in Latin America, is the governmental institution responsible of executing the Federal Government's health policy. The number of public hospitals in Mexico has increased 41% in ten years from 1985 to 1995.\n\nAccording to the site www.internationalliving.com, health care in Mexico is described as very good to excellent while being highly affordable, with every medium to large city in Mexico having at least one first-rate hospital.

The health of Paraguayans living outside urban areas is generally worse than those residing in cities. Many preventable diseases, such as [[Chagas' disease]], run rampant in rural regions. Parasitic and respiratory diseases, which could be controlled with proper medical treatment, drag down Paraguay's overall health. In general, [[malnutrition]], lack of proper health care, and poor [[sanitation]] are the root of many health problems in Paraguay.<ref name=autogenerated11>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Paraguay.pdf Paraguay country profile].

Spending on health care rose to 1.7 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2000, nearly triple the 0.6 percent of GDP spent in 1989. But during the past decade, improvement in health care has slowed. Paraguay spends less per capita (US$13\u201320 per year) than most other Latin American countries. A 2001 survey indicated that 27 percent of the population still had no access to medical care, public or private. Private health insurance is very limited, with pre-paid plans making up only 11 percent of private expenditures on health care. Thus, most of the money spent on private health care (about 88 percent) is on a fee-for-service basis, effectively preventing the poor population from seeing private doctors.

The service provision aspect of public health care has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access government-paid health care at public health care facilities where health insurance is not required. The health care system in the country is universal as almost all citizens utilise the services provided. Some, though, opt for private health care facilities for their ailments.\n\nRecently, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has launched CDAP (Chronic Disease Assistance Programme). The Chronic Disease Assistance Programme provides citizens with government-paid prescription drugs and other pharmaceutical items to combat several health conditions.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Health care in the United States}}\n{{See also|Health care reform in the United States|Health in the United States}}\n[[File:US Healthcare Spending.GIF|frame|right|U.S. healthcare spending.{{update after|2011}} Percent of GDP.

[[Health care reform in the United States]] usually focuses around three suggested systems, with proposals currently underway to integrate these systems in various ways to provide a number of health care options. First is [[Single-payer health care|single-payer]], a term meant to describe a single agency managing a single system, as found in many other developed countries as well as some states and municipalities within the United States. Second are employer or individual insurance mandates. Finally, there is consumer-driven health, in which systems, consumers, and patients have more control of how they access care. Over the past thirty years, most of the nation's health care has moved from the second model operating with not-for-profit institutions to the third model operating with for-profit institutions.\n\nIn the US, the social and political issues surrounding access to health care have led to vigorous public debate and the almost colloquial use of terms such as health care (medical management of illness), [[health insurance]] (reimbursement of health care costs), and [[public health]] (the collective state and range of health in a population). In the US, 12% to 16% of the citizens do not have health insurance. State boards and the Department of Health regulate inpatient care to reduce the national health care deficit. To tackle the problems of the increasing number of uninsured, and costs associated with the US health care system, President [[Barack Obama]] says he favors the creation of a universal health care system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|title=The Time Has Come for Universal Health Care |accessdate=30 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226054555/http://obama.senate.gov/speech/070125-the_time_has_co/|archivedate=26 December 2008}}</ref> However, this view is not shared across the country (see, for example, quotes from ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion columnist [[Paul Krugman]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/04/opinion/04krugman.html|title=Clinton, Obama, Insurance|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=4 February 2008 | work=The New York Times}}</ref> and [[Factcheck.org]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Jess Henig |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/141829 |title=Obama's Inflated Health Savings |publisher=Newsweek.com |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>).\n\nA few states have taken serious steps toward universal health care coverage, most notably [[Minnesota]], [[Massachusetts]] and [[Connecticut]], with recent examples being the [[Massachusetts 2006 Health Reform Statute]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usliberals.about.com/od/healthcare/i/MassHealthIns.htm |title=About.com's Pros & Cons of Massachusetts' Mandatory Health Insurance Program |publisher=Usliberals.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> and Connecticut's [[SustiNet]] plan to provide quality, affordable health care to state residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |accessdate=21 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017010420/http://www.aarp.org/states/ct/advocacy/articles/in_historic_vote_legislature_overrides_sustinet_veto.html |archivedate=17 October 2009 |title=In Historic Vote, Legislature Overrides SustiNet Veto}}</ref>\nThe state of Oregon and the city of San Francisco are both examples of governments that adopted universal healthcare systems for strictly fiscal reasons.\n\nThe United States is alone among developed nations in not having a [[universal health care]] system; the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] provides a nationwide [[health insurance exchange]] that came to fruition in 2014, but this is not universal in the way similar countries mean it.<ref>[http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm The Case For Single Payer, Universal Health Care For The United States] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |date=23 April 2018 }}.</ref> Healthcare in the U.S. does, however, have significant publicly funded components.

The New Rural Co-operative Medical Care System (NRCMCS) is a new 2005 initiative to overhaul the health care system, particularly intended to make it more affordable for the rural poor. Under the NRCMCS, the annual cost of medical cover is 50 yuan (US$7) per person. Of that, 20 yuan is paid in by the central government, 20 yuan by the provincial government and a contribution of 10 yuan is made by the patient. As of September 2007, around 80% of the whole rural population of China had signed up (about 685 million people). The system is tiered, depending on the location. If patients go to a small hospital or clinic in their local town, the scheme will cover from 70\u201380% of their bill. If they go to a county one, the percentage of the cost being covered falls to about 60%. And if they need specialist help in a large modern city hospital, they have to bear most of the cost themselves, the scheme would cover about 30% of the bill.<ref>\"The reform of the rural cooperative medical system in the People's Republic of China: interim experience in 14 pilot counties.\" Authors: Carrin G.1; Ron A.; Hui Y.; Hong W.; Tuohong Z.; Licheng Z.; Shuo Z.; Yide Y.; Jiaying C.; Qicheng J.; Zhaoyang Z.; Jun Y.; Xuesheng L.

In rural areas the first tier was made up of barefoot doctors working out of village medical centers. They provided preventive and primary-care services, with an average of two doctors per 1,000 people. At the next level were the township health centers, which functioned primarily as out-patient clinics for about 10,000 to 30,000 people each. These centers had about ten to thirty beds each, and the most qualified members of the staff were assistant doctors. The two lower-level tiers made up the \"rural collective health system\" that provided most of the country's medical care. Only the most seriously ill patients were referred to the third and final tier, the county hospitals, which served 200,000 to 600,000 people each and were staffed by senior doctors who held degrees from 5-year [[medical school]]s. Health care in urban areas was provided by paramedical personnel assigned to factories and neighborhood health stations. If more professional care was necessary the patient was sent to a district hospital, and the most serious cases were handled by municipal hospitals. To ensure a higher level of care, a number of state enterprises and government agencies sent their employees directly to district or municipal hospitals, circumventing the paramedical, or barefoot doctor, stage.\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Healthcare in India}}\n{{See also|Health in India}}\n\nIn India, the hospitals are run by government, charitable trusts and by private organizations. The government hospitals in rural areas are called [[Primary Health Centre]]s (PHCs). Major hospitals are located in district headquarters or major cities. Apart from the modern system of medicine, traditional and indigenous medicinal systems like [[Ayurvedic]] and [[Unani]] systems are in practice throughout the country. The modern system of medicine is regulated by the [[Medical Council of India]], whereas the alternative systems recognised by Government of India are regulated by the Department of [[AYUSH]] (an acronym for [[Ayurveda]], [[Yoga]], [[Unani]], [[Siddha]] & [[Homeopathy]]) under the [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (India)|Ministry of Health, Government of India]]. PHCs are non-existent in most places, due to poor pay and scarcity of resources. Patients generally prefer private health clinics. These days some of the major corporate hospitals are attracting patients from neighboring countries such as [[Pakistan]], countries in the [[Middle East]] and some [[Europe]]an countries by providing quality treatment at low cost.

However, [[bribes]] often are necessary to obtain needed care. The quality of health care, which remained entirely under state control in 2006, has declined in the post-Soviet era because of insufficient funding and the loss of technical experts through emigration. Between 1989 and 2001, the ratio of [[physician|doctors]] per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 15 percent, to 34.6, and the ratio of hospital beds per 10,000 inhabitants fell by 46 percent, to 74. By 2005 those indicators had recovered somewhat, to 55 and 77, respectively. Since 1991, health care has consistently lacked adequate government funding; in 2005 only 2.5 percent of [[gross domestic product]] went for that purpose. A government health reform program aims to increase that figure to 4 percent in 2010. A compulsory [[health insurance]] system has been in the planning stages for several years. Wages for health workers are extremely low, and equipment is in critically short supply. The main foreign source of medical equipment is Japan. Because of cost, the emphasis of treatment increasingly is on outpatient care instead of the hospital care preferred under the Soviet system.

About 19 percent of the population is [[malnourished]] \u2013 a higher rate than the 17 percent average for developing countries \u2013 and 30 percent of children under age five are malnourished. Leading causes of sickness and death include [[gastroenteritis]], [[respiratory infections]], [[congenital abnormalities]], [[tuberculosis]], [[malaria]], and [[typhoid fever]]. The [[United Nations]] estimates that in 2003 Pakistan's [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) prevalence rate was 0.1 percent among those 15\u201349, with an estimated 4,900 deaths from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a major health concern, and both the government and religious community are engaging in efforts to reduce its spread. In 2003 there were 68 physicians for every 100,000 persons in Pakistan. According to 2002 government statistics, there were 12,501 health institutions nationwide, including 4,590 dispensaries, 906 [[hospitals]] with a total of 80,665 hospital beds, and 550 rural health centers with a total of 8,840 beds. According to the [[World Health Organization]], Pakistan's '''total health expenditures''' amounted to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product ([[GDP]]) in 2001, and per capita health expenditures were US$16. The government provided 24.4 percent of total health expenditures, with the remainder being entirely private, out-of-pocket expenses.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main|Health care in the Philippines}}\n{{See also|Health in the Philippines}}\n\nIn 2000 the [[Philippines]] had about 95,000 [[physician]]s, or about 1 per 800 people. In 2001 there were about 1,700 [[hospital]]s, of which about 40 percent were government-run and 60 percent private, with a total of about 85,000 beds, or about one bed per 900 people. The leading causes of morbidity as of 2002 were [[diarrhea]], [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[influenza]], [[hypertension]], [[tuberculosis]], [[heart disease]], [[malaria]], [[chickenpox]], and [[measles]]. [[Cardiovascular diseases]] account for more than 25 percent of all deaths. According to official estimates, 1,965 cases of [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) were reported in 2003, of which 636 had developed [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS).

Singapore generally has an efficient and widespread system of health care. It implements a [[universal health care]] system, and co-exists with private health care system. [[Infant mortality]] rate: in 2006 the crude birth rate stood at 10.1 per 1000, and the crude death rate was also one of the lowest in the world at 4.3 per 1000. In 2006, the total fertility rate was only 1.26 children per woman, the 3rd lowest in the world and well below the 2.10 needed to replace the population. Singapore was ranked 6th in the [[World Health Organization]]'s ranking of the world's health systems in the year 2000.\n\n[[Singapore]] has a universal health care system where government ensures affordability, largely through compulsory savings and price controls, while the private sector provides most care. Overall spending on health care amounts to only 3% of annual GDP. Of that, 66% comes from private sources.<ref name=\"WHOSIS\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/database/core/core_select.cfm |title=World Health Organization Statistical Information System: Core Health Indicators |publisher=Who.int |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> Singapore currently has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equaled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth, according to the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/entity/whosis/whostat2007_1mortality.pdf \"World Health Statistics 2007: Mortality\"], based on 2005 data.</ref> Singapore has \"one of the most successful health care systems in the world, in terms of both efficiency in financing and the results achieved in community health outcomes,\" according to an analysis by global consulting firm [[Watson Wyatt Worldwide|Watson Wyatt]].<ref name=\"Watson Wyatt Singapore\"/> Singapore's system uses a combination of compulsory savings from payroll deductions (funded by both employers and workers) a nationalized catastrophic health insurance plan, and government subsidies, as well as \"actively regulating the supply and prices of health care services in the country\" to keep costs in check; the specific features have been described as potentially a \"very difficult system to replicate in many other countries.\" Many Singaporeans also have supplemental private health insurance (often provided by employers) for services not covered by the government's programs.<ref name=\"Watson Wyatt Singapore\">John Tucci, [http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 \"The Singapore health system \u2013 achieving positive health outcomes with low expenditure\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419231253/http://www.watsonwyatt.com/europe/pubs/healthcare/render2.asp?ID=13850 |date=19 April 2010 }}, Watson Wyatt Healthcare Market Review, October 2004.</ref>\n\nSingapore's well-established health care system comprises a total of 13 private hospitals, 10 public (government) hospitals and several specialist clinics, each specializing in and catering to different patient needs, at varying costs.\n\nPatients are free to choose the providers within the government or private health care delivery system and can walk in for a consultation at any private clinic or any government polyclinic. For emergency services, patients can go at any time to the 24-hour Accident & Emergency Departments located in the government hospitals.\n\nSingapore's medical facilities are among the finest in the world, with well qualified doctors and dentists, many trained overseas.\n\nSingapore has [[medical savings account]] system known as [[Medisave]].\n\n===Syria===\n{{Main|Health in Syria}}\n\nThe [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Ba'ath Party]] has placed an emphasis on [[health care]], but funding levels have not been able to keep up with demand or maintain quality. Health expenditures reportedly accounted for 2.5 percent of the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) in 2001. Syria's health system is relatively decentralized and focuses on offering primary health care at three levels: village, district, and provincial. According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), in 1990 Syria had 41 general [[hospital]]s (33 public, 8 private), 152 specialized hospitals (16 public, 136 private), 391 rural health centers, 151 urban health centers, 79 rural health units, and 49 specialized health centers; [[hospital bed]]s totaled 13,164 (77 percent public, 23 percent private), or 11 beds per 10,000 inhabitants. The number of state hospital beds reportedly fell between 1995 and 2001, while the population had an 18 percent increase, but the opening of new hospitals in 2002 caused the number of hospital beds to double. WHO reported that in 1989 Syria had a total of 10,114 [[physician]]s, 3,362 [[dentist]]s, and 14,816 [[nurse]]s and [[midwive]]s; in 1995 the rate of health professionals per 10,000 inhabitants was 10.9 physicians, 5.6 dentists, and 21.2 nurses and midwives. Despite overall improvements, Syria's health system exhibits significant regional disparities in the availability of health care, especially between urban and rural areas. The number of private hospitals and doctors increased by 41 percent between 1995 and 2001 as a result of growing demand and growing wealth in a small sector of society. Almost all private health facilities are located in large urban areas such as [[Damascus]], [[Aleppo]], [[Tartus]], and [[Latakia]].<ref name=autogenerated6>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf Syria country profile].

NHI is a single-payer compulsory social insurance plan which centralizes the disbursement of health care dollars. The system promises equal access to health care for all citizens, and the population coverage had reached 99% by the end of 2004.<ref>Fanchiang, Cecilia.[http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 \"New IC health insurance card expected to offer many benefits\"], ''Taiwan Journal, 2 January 2004'' Accessed 28 March 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606010447/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/site/Tj/ct.asp?xItem=20439&CtNode=122 |date=6 June 2008 }}</ref> NHI is mainly financed through premiums, which are based on the payroll tax, and is supplemented with out-of-pocket payments and direct government funding. In the initial stage, fee-for-service predominated for both public and private providers. Most health providers operate in the private sector and form a competitive market on the health delivery side. However, many health care providers took advantage of the system by offering unnecessary services to a larger number of patients and then billing the government. In the face of increasing loss and the need for cost containment, NHI changed the payment system from fee-for-service to a global budget, a kind of prospective payment system, in 2002.\n\nAccording to [[T.R. Reid]], Taiwan achieves \"remarkable efficiency\", costing \u22486 percent of GDP [[universal health care|universal coverage]]; however, this underestimates the cost as it is not fully funded and the government is forced to borrow to make up the difference. \"And frankly, the solution is fairly obvious: increase the spending a little, to maybe 8 percent of GDP. Of course, if Taiwan did that, it would still be spending less than half of what America spends.\"<ref name=trr>[[T.R.

[[Universal health care]] is provided through three programs: the civil service welfare system for civil servants and their families, Social Security for private employees, and the Universal Coverage scheme theoretically available to all other Thai nationals. Some private hospitals are participants in these programs, though most are financed by patient self-payment and private insurance.\n\nThe [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH) oversees national health policy and also operates most government health facilities. The National Health Security Office (NHSO) allocates funding through the Universal Coverage program. Other health-related government agencies include the Health System Research Institute (HSRI), Thai Health Promotion\nFoundation (\"ThaiHealth\"), National Health Commission Office (NHCO), and the Emergency Medical Institute of Thailand (EMIT). Although there have been national policies for decentralization, there has been resistance in implementing such changes and the MOPH still directly controls most aspects of health care.\n\n===Turkmenistan===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Turkmenistan}}\n{{See also|Health in Turkmenistan}}\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, reduced funding has put the health system in poor condition. In 2002 [[Turkmenistan]] had 50 hospital beds per 10,000 population, less than half the number in 1996. Overall policy has targeted specialized inpatient facilities to the detriment of basic, outpatient care. Since the late 1990s, many rural facilities have closed, making care available principally in urban areas. President [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov]]\u2019s 2005 proposal to close all hospitals outside [[Ashgabat]] intensified this trend. [[Physicians]] are poorly trained, modern medical techniques are rarely used, and medications are in short supply. In 2004 Niyazov dismissed 15,000 medical professionals, exacerbating the shortage of personnel. In some cases, professionals have been replaced by military conscripts. Private health care is rare, as the state maintains a near monopoly. Government-paid public health care was abolished in 2004.<ref name=autogenerated15>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf Turkmenistan country profile].

According to the UAE government, total expenditures on health care from 1996 to 2003 were US$436 million. According to the [[World Health Organization]], in 2004 total expenditures on health care constituted 2.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and the per capita expenditure for health care was US$497. Health care currently is government-paid only for UAE citizens. Effective January 2006, all residents of [[Abu Dhabi]] are covered by a new comprehensive health insurance program; costs will be shared between employers and employees. The number of [[physician|doctors]] per 100,000 (annual average, 1990\u201399) is 181. The UAE now has 40 public hospitals, compared with only seven in 1970. The Ministry of Health is undertaking a multimillion-dollar program to expand health facilities \u2013 hospitals, medical centers, and a trauma center \u2013 in the seven emirates. A state-of-the-art general hospital has opened in Abu Dhabi with a projected bed capacity of 143, a trauma unit, and the first home health care program in the UAE. To attract wealthy UAE nationals and expatriates who traditionally have traveled abroad for serious medical care, Dubai is developing [[Dubai Healthcare City]], a hospital free zone that will offer international-standard advanced private health care and provide an academic medical training center; completion is scheduled for 2010.<ref name=autogenerated13>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/UAE.pdf United Arab Emirates country profile].

Between 1992 and 2003, spending on health care and the ratio of hospital beds to population both decreased by nearly 50 percent, and Russian [[emigration]] in that decade deprived the health system of many practitioners. In 2004 Uzbekistan had 53 hospital beds per 10,000 population. Basic medical supplies such as disposable [[Hypodermic needle|needles]], [[anesthetics]], and [[antibiotics]] are in very short supply. Although all citizens nominally are entitled to [[government-paid health care|free health care]], in the post-Soviet era [[bribery]] has become a common way to bypass the slow and limited service of the state system. In the early 2000s, policy has focused on improving primary health care facilities and cutting the cost of inpatient facilities. The state budget for 2006 allotted 11.1 percent to health expenditures, compared with 10.9 percent in 2005.<ref name=autogenerated12>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf Uzbekistan country profile].

However, [[malnutrition]] is still common in the provinces, and the life expectancy and [[infant mortality]] rates are stagnating. In 2001 government spending on health care corresponded to just 0.9 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Government subsidies covered only about 20 percent of health care expenses, with the remaining 80 percent coming out of individuals\u2019 own pockets.<ref name=autogenerated9>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Vietnam.pdf Vietnam country profile].

After reunification in 1976, this system was extended to the South. Beginning in the late 1980s, the quality of health care began to decline as a result of budgetary constraints, a shift of responsibility to the provinces, and the introduction of charges. Inadequate funding has led to delays in planned upgrades to [[water supply]] and [[sewage]] systems. As a result, almost half the population has no access to clean water, a deficiency that promotes such infectious diseases as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[typhoid]], and [[cholera]]. Inadequate funding also has contributed to a shortage of [[nurses]], [[midwives]], and hospital beds. In 2000 Vietnam had only 250,000 hospital beds, or 14.8 beds per 10,000 people, a very low ratio among Asian nations, according to the [[World Bank]].<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Yemen===\n{{Main|Health in Yemen}}\n\nDespite the significant progress [[Yemen]] has made to expand and improve its health care system over the past decade, the system remains severely underdeveloped.

According to the [[World Bank]], the number of [[physician|doctors]] in Yemen rose by an average of more than 7 percent between 1995 and 2000, but as of 2004 there were still only three doctors per 10,000 persons.

A person must have adequate coverage through either the state or private insurance. In the state ''mutuelle/mutualiteit'' scheme a person has the ability to choose any doctor, clinic or hospital in any location without referral, according to the patient's needs in much the same way as with private insurance.\n\n====Doctors====\nGeneral practitioners can be found in private practices or attached to clinics and hospitals. A person is free to consult or register with any of their own choosing.  Similarly with specialist consultants. Reimbursements are available for those with insurance, either private or public. If a patient is on a private scheme, or is uninsured, the fee is payable in full at the time of the appointment. The patient then brings, mails or deposits the receipt to his insurance mutuality which then immediately repays the amount.\n\nThe majority of dentists in Belgium are private, though there are those who accept part-payment on state insurance.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAs with general practitioners, patients can arrange to see a specialist of their choice at any hospital. Those going into hospital for a planned stay need to take personal care items (such as a towel, soap etc.) with them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130115045216/http://www.jessazh.be/patienten-bezoekers/opname/campus-salvator/gewone-opname/wat-meebrengen |archivedate=15 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[Brussels]], the eleven big public hospitals are organized under the Iris association.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iris-hopitaux.be/|title=H\u00f4pitaux du r\u00e9seau Iris Bruxelles|publisher=|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Complementary health care====\nThe Ministry of Health recognizes [[homeopathy]], [[acupuncture]], [[osteopathy]] and [[chiropractic]] as reimbursable alternative treatments.

To enroll, a person must first join a health insurance fund ''mutuelle'' (''mutualit\u00e9'') or ''ziekenfonds'' (''mutualiteit'') for which an employer's certificate is required if the employer is to contribute to the cost. If employed a person's contributions is automatically deducted from salary. The employer will also pay a contribution. Health insurance funds will reimburse medical costs. The choice of mutual insurer is up to the individual. Most of them are affiliated to a religious or political institution but there is no real difference between them because reimbursement rates are fixed by the Belgian government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&la=N&table_name=wet&cn=1994071438|title=LOI|publisher=WET|accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nInsurance funds do not always cover the full costs of treatment and typical reimbursement is between half to three-quarters of a typical doctors or specialists visit. A deciding factor here depends on one's job. From people who are unemployed or disabled, receiving other benefits or business-owners receive somewhat less.  There is also a ''\"yearly maximum bill\"'' meaning that someone who has paid a certain amount to their doctor/hospital within the year does not have to make any further payment. From this point, any extra is returned from the patient's insurance. In general, the poor, even without reaching the necessary sum, do not pay anything.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610230110/https://www.socialsecurity.be/CMS/nl/citizen/displayThema/health/SANTH_4/SANTH_4_3.xml |archivedate=10 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nInsured persons have a standardized credit card style SIS-card<ref>[[:nl:SIS-kaart]], Retrieved 2010-05-01{{Circular reference|date=August 2015}}</ref> which is needed in pharmacies and hospitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bcss.fgov.be/nl/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/legislation/legislation_04.html|title=Site has moved  |publisher=CBSS \u2013 Crossroads Bank for Social Security|accessdate=30 November 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306035452/https://www.bcss.fgov.be/nl/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/legislation/legislation_04.html|archivedate=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Bulgaria===\n{{Main|Health in Bulgaria}}\n\n[[Bulgaria]] began overall reform of its antiquated health system, inherited from the [[communist]] era, only in 1999. In the 1990s, private medical practices expanded somewhat, but most Bulgarians relied on communist-era public [[clinic]]s while paying high prices for special care. During that period, national health indicators generally worsened as economic crises substantially decreased health funding. The subsequent health reform program has introduced mandatory employee health insurance through the [[National Health Insurance Fund]] (NHIF), which since 2000 has paid a gradually increasing portion of primary health care costs. Employees and employers pay an increasing, mandatory percentage of [[Salary|salaries]], with the goal of gradually reducing state support of health care. Private health insurance plays only a supplementary role. The system also has been decentralized by making municipalities responsible for their own health care facilities, and by 2005 most primary care came from private [[physician]]s. Pharmaceutical distribution also was decentralized.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Bulgaria.pdf Bulgaria country profile]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (October 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, the hospital system was reduced substantially to limit reliance on hospitals for routine care. Anticipated membership in the [[European Union]] (2007) was a major motivation for this trend. Between 2002 and 2003, the number of hospital beds was reduced by 56 percent to 24,300. However, the pace of reduction slowed in the early 2000s; in 2004 some 258 hospitals were in operation, compared with the estimated optimal number of 140. Between 2002 and 2004, health care expenditures in the national budget increased from 3.8 percent to 4.3 percent, with the NHIF accounting for more than 60 percent of annual expenditures.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the 1990s, the quality of medical research and training decreased seriously because of low funding. In the early 2000s, the emphasis of medical and [[paramedic]]al training, which was conducted in five medical schools, was preparation of primary-care personnel to overcome shortages resulting from the communist system's long-term emphasis on training specialists. Experts considered that Bulgaria had an adequate supply of [[physician|doctors]] but a shortage of other medical personnel. In 2000 Bulgaria had 3.4 doctors, 3.9 nurses, and 0.5 midwives per 1,000 population.<ref name=cp/>\n\n===Denmark===\n{{Main|Health care in Denmark}}\n\nDenmark's health care system has retained the same basic structure since the early 1970s. The administration of hospitals and personnel is dealt with by the Ministry of the Interior, while primary care facilities, health insurance, and community care are the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs. Anyone can go to a physician for no fee and the public health system entitles each Dane to his/her own doctor. Expert medical/surgical aid is available, with a qualified nursing staff. Costs are borne by public authorities, but high taxes contribute to these costs. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.4 physicians and 4.5 hospital beds per 1,000 people. The number of hospital beds, like that in other EU countries, has undergone a major decline since 1980, from around 40,000 to about 23,000 in 1998/99. Deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients has contributed significantly to this trend. The ratio of doctors to population, by contrast, has increased during this period.\n\nThe total fertility rate in 2000 was 1.7, while the maternal mortality rate was 10 per 100,000 live births as of 1998. Studies show that between 1980 and 1993, 63% of married women (ages 15 to 49) used contraception. As of 2002 cardiovascular diseases and cancer were the leading causes of death. Denmark's cancer rates were the highest in the European Union. In 1999, there were only 12 reported cases of tuberculosis per 100,000 people. As of 1999, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS was estimated at 4,300 and deaths from AIDS that year were estimated at less than 100. HIV prevalence was 0.17 per 100 adults.\n\nDanish citizens may choose between two systems of primary health care: medical care paid for by the government provided by a doctor whom the individual chooses for a year and by those specialists to whom the doctor refers the patient; or complete freedom of choice of any physician or specialist at any time, with state reimbursement of about two-thirds of the cost for medical bills paid directly by the patient. Most Danes opt for the former. All patients receive subsidies on pharmaceuticals and vital drugs; everyone must pay a share of dental bills. As of 1999, total health care expenditure was estimated at 8.4% of GDP.\n\nResponsibility for the public hospital service rests with county authorities. Counties form public hospital regions, each of which is allotted one or two larger hospitals with specialists and two to four smaller hospitals where medical treatment is practically totally paid for by the government. State-appointed medical health officers, responsible to the National Board of Health, are employed to advise local governments on health matters. Public health authorities have waged large-scale campaigns against tuberculosis, venereal diseases, diphtheria, and poliomyelitis. The government-paid guidance and assistance given to mothers of newborn children by public health nurses have resulted in a low infant mortality rate of 4 per 1,000 live births (2000). Medical treatment is government-paid up to school age, when government-paid school medical inspections begin. As of 1999, children up to one year of age were vaccinated against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (99%) and measles (92%). In 2000, life expectancy at birth was 76 years for males and females. The overall death rate was 11 per 1,000 people in 1999.\n\n===Estonia===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Estonia}}\n\nHealthcare in Estonia is supervised by the [[Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs|Ministry of Social Affairs]] and funded by general taxation through the National Health Service.\n\n===Finland===\n{{Main|Healthcare in Finland}}\n\nIn [[Finland]], public medical services at clinics and hospitals are run by the municipalities (local government) and are funded 78% by [[taxation]], 20% by patients through access charges, and by others 2%. Patient access charges are subject to annual caps. For example, GP visits are (\u20ac11 per visit with annual \u20ac33 cap), hospital outpatient treatment (\u20ac22 per visit), a hospital stay, including food, medical care and medicines (\u20ac26 per 24 hours, or \u20ac12 if in a psychiatric hospital). After a patient has spent \u20ac590 per year on public medical services, all treatment and medications thereafter are paid for by the government. Taxation funding is partly local and partly nationally based. Patients can claim re-imbursement of part of their prescription costs from [[KELA (Finnish Social Insurance)|KELA]]. Finland also has a much smaller private medical sector which accounts for about 14 percent of total health care spending. Only 8% of doctors choose to work in private practice, and some of these also choose to do some work in the public sector. Private sector patients can claim a contribution from KELA towards their private medical costs (including [[dentistry]]) if they choose to be treated in the more expensive private sector, or they can join private insurance funds. However, private sector health care is mainly in the primary care sector. There are virtually no private hospitals, the main hospitals being either municipally owned (funded from local taxes) or run by the teaching universities (funded jointly by the municipalities and the national government). In 2005, Finland spent 7.5% of GDP on health care, or US$2,824 per capita. Of that, approximately 78% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n===France===\n{{Main|Health care in France}}\n\nIn its [[World Health Organization ranking of health systems|2000 assessment of world health systems]], the [[World Health Organization]] found that France provided the \"best overall health care\" in the world.<ref name=\"WHO2000\"/> In 2005, France spent 11.2% of GDP on health care, or US$3,926 per capita. Of that, approximately 80% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\nIn [[France]], most doctors remain in private practice; there are both [[Private sector|private]] and [[public hospital|public]] [[hospital]]s. Social Security consists of several public organizations, distinct from the state government, with separate budgets that refunds patients for care in both private and public facilities. It generally refunds patients 70% of most health care costs, and 100% in case of costly or long-term ailments. Supplemental coverage may be bought from private insurers, most of them [[nonprofit]], [[mutual insurer]]s, to the point that the word \"{{ill|mutuelle|fr|Mutuelle de sant\u00e9 en France|vertical-align=sup}}\" (mutual) has come to be a synonym of supplemental private insurer in common language.\n\nUntil recently, social security coverage was restricted to those who contributed to social security (generally, workers, unemployed or retirees), excluding some few poor segments of the population; the government of [[Lionel Jospin]] put into place the \"universal health coverage\" allowing the entire French population to benefit from Health care. In some systems, patients can also take private health insurance but choose to receive care at public hospitals, if allowed by the private [[insurer]]. For serious illness, regardless of the insurance regime, the national health system will assume the cost of long-term remedial treatment.\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|Health in Germany}}\n[[File:UniKlinik (Freiburg) 4.jpg|thumb|The [[University Medical Center Freiburg]] in [[Germany]]]]\n\n[[Germany]] has a universal multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: Public \"law-enforced\" health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung), and private health insurance (Private Krankenversicherung)\n.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |title=The Case for Universal Health Care in the United States |publisher=Cthealth.server101.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423105127/http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm |archive-date=23 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221134435/http://www.willamette.edu/centers/publicpolicy/projects/oregonsfuture/PDFvol5no2/countries_healthcare.pdf |archivedate=21 February 2006 }}</ref> Those who make below a certain income must use the public health insurance.

There is almost no private health insurance in Iceland and no private hospitals.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nAll persons resident in the [[Republic of Ireland]] are entitled to health care through the public health care system, which is managed by the [[Health Service Executive]] and funded by general taxation. A person may be required to pay a subsidised fee for certain health care received; this depends on income, age, illness or disability. All maternity services are however paid for by the government, as well as health care of infants under 6 months of age.

For example, most adults use private dental care, whereas the public system only treats people, for a normal fee, when they have free capacity. Health-related plastic surgery (like burn damage) is covered by the public system, while cosmetic surgery in general is private. There are a number of private psychologists, there are also some private general practice doctors and specialists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nPublic health care is financed by a special-purpose income tax on the order of 8\u201311%, loosely translated as \"public benefits fee\" (Norwegian: \"trygdeavgift og Folketrygden\"). This can be considered a mandatory public insurance, covering not only health care but also loss of income during sick leave, public pension, unemployment benefits, benefits for single parents and a few others. The system is supposed to be self-financing from the taxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nNorwegian citizens living in Norway are automatically covered, even if they never had taxable income.

Though the public systems dominate, private health care and a wide variety of alternative and complementary treatments are available for those who have private health insurance or are willing to pay directly themselves.\n\nOne difference between the four public health care systems is the patient cost for prescriptions. Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have recently abolished, or are in the process of abolishing, all prescription charges, while England (with the exception of [[birth control pills]], which are paid for by the state) continues to charge patients who are between 18 and 60 years old a fixed prescription fee of \u00a38.40 per item, unless they are exempt because of certain medical conditions (including cancer) or are on low income. Since health care delivery is a [[devolution|devolved matter]], considerable differences are developing between the systems in each of the countries.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7149423.stm NHS now four different systems], [[BBC]], 2 January 2008</ref>\n\n==Oceania==\n\n===Australia===\n{{Main|Health care in Australia}}\n\nIn [[Australia]] the current system, known as [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], was instituted in 1984.

Treatment by private doctors is also paid by the government when the doctor direct bills the Health Department (Bulk Billing). Medicare is funded partly by a 1.5% income tax levy (with exceptions for low-income earners), but mostly out of general revenue. An additional levy of 1% is imposed on high-income earners without private health insurance. There is a means tested 30% subsidy on private health insurance. As well as Medicare, there is a separate [[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme]] under which listing and a government subsidy is dependent on expert evaluation of the comparative cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals. In 2005, Australia spent 8.8% of [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] on health care, or US$3,181 per capita.  Of that, approximately 67% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\">{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/whosis/data/Search.jsp |title=WHO Statistical Information System |accessdate=2008-09-23 |publisher=World Health Organization}}</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{Main|Health care in New Zealand}}\n\nIn [[New Zealand]] hospitals are public and treat citizens or permanent residents, with the fees paid by the government, and are managed by [[District Health Boards (New Zealand)|District Health Boards]]. Under the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] coalition governments (1999\u20132008), there were plans to make [[primary health care]] available with charges paid for by the government. At present government subsidies exist in health care. The cost of visiting a GP ranges from government-paid to $45.00 for children and from government-paid to $75.00 for adults under the current subsidies. This system is funded by taxes. The New Zealand government agency [[Pharmaceutical Management Agency|Pharmac]] subsidizes certain pharmaceuticals depending upon their category. Co-payments exist, however these are lower if the user has a ''Community Services Card'' or ''High User Health Card''. In 2005, New Zealand spent 8.9% of GDP on health care, or US$2,403 per capita. Of that, approximately 77% was government expenditure.<ref name=\"WHOSIS_spending\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tobacco_politics|Tobacco control laws by country]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Africa topic|Health care in}}\n{{Americas topic|Health care in}}\n{{Asia topic|Health care in}}\n{{Europe topic|Health care in}}\n{{Oceania topic|Health care in}}\n{{Population country lists}}\n\n[[Category:Health by country| ]]\n[[Category:Health insurance by country]]\n", "name_user": "CFynn", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBhutan", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_systems_by_country"}

He decides to be honest with her before their relationship goes any further. Their conversation prompts Dan to get in contact with Samantha.<ref name=\"Married\"/> Tucker said, \"Dan realises he has got a few things to sort out with his ex.

On Dan's return, Libby makes him promise not to have any further contact with Samantha.\n\nA year later, when [[Charlie Hoyland]] (Jacob Brito) wanders off during Halloween, Samantha finds him and runs into Steph, Lucas and [[Lyn Scully]] ([[Janet Andrewartha]]). Lucas and Samantha talk and she tells him that she is good. Steph thanks Samantha for finding Charlie and Samantha tells her that she has been to see Dan and [[Adam Fitzgerald (Neighbours)|Adam]]. Lyn asks Samantha what brings her back to town and Samantha tells her that she is there to prosecute Steph's culpable driving case. The next day, Samantha goes to see Donna and says that she is sorry that her husband, [[Ringo Brown]] ([[Sam Clark]]), is dead. Samantha asks Donna if they can meet, but Donna turns her down. Samantha later sees Donna's university lecturer fail her assignment and asks if she can buy her and [[Kate Ramsay]] ([[Ashleigh Brewer]]) tea. Samantha talks to Kate about her witness statement and when she goes to Ramsay Street to talk to Paul, she sees Libby. Samantha tells [[Karl Kennedy|Karl]] ([[Alan Fletcher (actor)|Alan Fletcher]]) and [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]) that she has recently lost her father and that she is sorry for what she did to them.

Steph takes her away and tells her to back off. Samantha later gives Steph some leaflets about children in prison. Toadie tells Samantha that he will report her to the police and [[bar association]] for witness intimidation. Paul meets her in Charlie's and tells her that he wants to help Samantha out and he will give her anything she wants.

Samantha asks Karl and Susan to write victim impact statements and when she notices something is up between the couple, she talks to Susan and tells her that she will find out if something is wrong.

It was animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]], [[Nippon Television Network]] and [[Hakuhodo]], and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film stars [[Yoko Honna]], Issei Takahashi, Takashi Tachibana, [[Shigeru Muroi]], [[Shigeru Tsuyuguchi]] and [[Keiju Kobayashi]]. It was the first theatrical [[Studio Ghibli]] film to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or [[Isao Takahata]].\n\n''Whisper of the Heart'' was Kond\u014d's only film as director before his death in 1998. Studio Ghibli had hoped that Kond\u014d would become the successor to Miyazaki and Takahata.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yoshifumi Kondou Kondou Yoshifumi|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/kondo/#passing|website=Nausicaa.net|publisher=Nausicaa|accessdate=November 14, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128201133/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/kondo/#passing|archivedate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt was the only theatrical Ghibli film not directed by Miyazaki or Takahata for seven years until ''[[The Cat Returns]]'' was released in 2002, which focused on a minor character of the film, Baron.\n\n==Plot==\nShizuku Tsukishima is a 14-year-old student at Mukaihara Junior High School, where she is best friends with Yuko Harada. Living in Tokyo with her parents Asako and Seiya, as well as her older sister Shiho, Shizuku is a bookworm and is keen on writing. During an ordinary evening, she looks through the checkout cards in her library books. She discovers they all have been checked out by Seiji Amasawa (\u5929\u6ca2 \u8056\u53f8). Over the next few days, Shizuku encounters a young man, later revealed to be Seiji, who often annoys her.\n\nFinding a cat riding a train, Shizuku follows it to discover an [[antique shop]] run by Shiro Nishi. In the shop is a cat statuette nicknamed \"The Baron\".\n\nLater at the antique shop, Shizuku sings \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\", a song she has been translating for her school graduation, accompanied by Seiji and Nishi. Seiji is revealed to be the grandson of Nishi, and Shizuku and Seiji befriend each other. Seiji is learning to make violins to follow his dream as a master [[luthier]]. Days after the two meet, Seiji leaves for [[Cremona]], Italy, for a two-month study with a master violin-maker, but not before professing his admiration for Shizuku\u2019s talents. Firming her resolve, Shizuku decides to test her talents as well. Discussing with Yuko, she decides to pursue her writing seriously during the two months. She asks Nishi if she can write about The Baron, to which Nishi grants his consent on the condition that he will be the first to read the finished story.\n\nShizuku begins to concoct a fantasy story featuring herself as the female protagonist, the Baron as the male hero who is looking for his lost love, Louise, and the cat she followed from the train (who is, among other names, known as \"Moon\" and \"Muta\") as the story's villain who took her from him. Devoting her time to her writing, Shizuku eats snacks, stays up until early in the morning, and her school grades drop. Shizuku argues with her family over her grades, and as she continues to push herself into finishing the story before Seiji returns, she begins to lose heart.\n\nWhen her story is complete, Shizuku delivers the manuscript to Nishi. After Nishi reads Shizuku's writing and gives her his benevolent assessment, she breaks down in tears as the stress of the last two months finally turns into relief. Consoling her with [[udon]], Nishi reveals to Shizuku that when he studied in Germany in his youth, he found his first love, Louise. They discovered the twin statuettes of the Baron and his female companion in a cafe, but they could only purchase them singly because the female statuette was being repaired at that time. Nishi kept the Baron while Louise would hold onto the Baron's companion, and they and the two cat statuettes would reunite at a later time. However, the two lovers and the statues were subsequently separated during [[World War II]] and were never reunited. In the English dub, Seiji tells Shizuku that The Baron has a missing partner during her second visit to the shop but in the Japanese dialogue he says his grandfather won't tell anyone the story of the Baron and it is coincidence, intuition, or serendipity that Shizuku creates a missing partner for him, much to Nishi's surprise.\n\nDeciding she wants to attend high school to learn more about writing, Shizuku is returned home by Nishi and announces to her mother that she will return to studying for her entrance exams full-time. The next morning, she encounters Seiji on his bicycle. He has returned a day early. In the English dub he says he has decided to finish high school before returning to Cremona to become a luthier, the Japanese dialogue says he will be returning after graduation, as planned.\n\nThe two ride Seiji's bike to a lookout and watch the sun rise over the city, where Seiji professes his love for Shizuku and proposes future marriage; she happily accepts.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was animated by [[Studio Ghibli]] for [[Tokuma Shoten]], [[Nippon Television Network]] and [[Hakuhodo]], and distributed by [[Toho]]. The film stars [[Yoko Honna]], Issei Takahashi, Takashi Tachibana, [[Shigeru Muroi]], [[Shigeru Tsuyuguchi]] and [[Keiju Kobayashi]]. It was the first theatrical [[Studio Ghibli]] film to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or [[Isao Takahata]].\n\n''Whisper of the Heart'' was Kond\u014d's only film as director before his death in 1998. Studio Ghibli had hoped that Kond\u014d would become the successor to Miyazaki and Takahata.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yoshifumi Kondou Kondou Yoshifumi|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/kondo/#passing|website=Nausicaa.net|publisher=Nausicaa|accessdate=November 14, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128201133/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/kondo/#passing|archivedate=November 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIt was the only theatrical Ghibli film not directed by Miyazaki or Takahata for seven years until ''[[The Cat Returns]]'' was released in 2002, which focused on a minor character of the film, Baron.\n\n==Plot==\nShizuku Tsukishima is a 14-year-old student at Mukaihara Junior High School, where she is best friends with Yuko Harada. Living in Tokyo with her parents Asako and Seiya, as well as her older sister Shiho, Shizuku is a bookworm and is keen on writing. During an ordinary evening, she looks through the checkout cards in her library books. She discovers they all have been checked out by Seiji Amasawa (\u5929\u6ca2 \u8056\u53f8). Over the next few days, Shizuku encounters a young man, later revealed to be Seiji, who often annoys her.\n\nFinding a cat riding a train, Shizuku follows it to discover an [[antique shop]] run by Shiro Nishi. In the shop is a cat statuette nicknamed \"The Baron\".\n\nLater at the antique shop, Shizuku sings \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\", a song she has been translating for her school graduation, accompanied by Seiji and Nishi. Seiji is revealed to be the grandson of Nishi, and Shizuku and Seiji befriend each other. Seiji is learning to make violins to follow his dream as a master [[luthier]]. Days after the two meet, Seiji leaves for [[Cremona]], Italy, for a two-month study with a master violin-maker, but not before professing his admiration for Shizuku\u2019s talents. Firming her resolve, Shizuku decides to test her talents as well. Discussing with Yuko, she decides to pursue her writing seriously during the two months. She asks Nishi if she can write about The Baron, to which Nishi grants his consent on the condition that he will be the first to read the finished story.\n\nShizuku begins to concoct a fantasy story featuring herself as the female protagonist, the Baron as the male hero who is looking for his lost love, Louise, and the cat she followed from the train (who is, among other names, known as \"Moon\" and \"Muta\") as the story's villain who took her from him. Devoting her time to her writing, Shizuku eats snacks, stays up until early in the morning, and her school grades drop. Shizuku argues with her family over her grades, and as she continues to push herself into finishing the story before Seiji returns, she begins to lose heart.\n\nWhen her story is complete, Shizuku delivers the manuscript to Nishi. After Nishi reads Shizuku's writing and gives her his benevolent assessment, she breaks down in tears as the stress of the last two months finally turns into relief. Consoling her with [[udon]], Nishi reveals to Shizuku that when he studied in Germany in his youth, he found his first love, Louise. They discovered the twin statuettes of the Baron and his female companion in a cafe, but they could only purchase them singly because the female statuette was being repaired at that time. Nishi kept the Baron while Louise would hold onto the Baron's companion, and they and the two cat statuettes would reunite at a later time. However, the two lovers and the statues were subsequently separated during [[World War II]] and were never reunited. In the English dub, Seiji tells Shizuku that The Baron has a missing partner during her second visit to the shop but in the Japanese dialogue he says his grandfather won't tell anyone the story of the Baron and it is coincidence, intuition, or serendipity that Shizuki creates a missing partner for him, much to Nishi's surprise.\n\nDeciding she wants to attend high school to learn more about writing, Shizuku is returned home by Nishi and announces to her mother that she will return to studying for her entrance exams full-time. The next morning, she encounters Seiji on his bicycle. He has returned a day early. In the English dub he says he has decided to finish high school before returning to Cremona to become a luthier, the Japanese dialogue says he will be returning after graduation, as planned.\n\nThe two ride Seiji's bike to a lookout and watch the sun rise over the city, where Seiji professes his love for Shizuku and proposes future marriage; she happily accepts.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It concerns a schoolgirl's crush on her teacher which leads to an affair, which in turn is discovered.\n\nThe band's third {{thinspace|No.|1}} on the [[UK Singles Chart]], it was also the [[1980 in British music#Top 50 selling singles|best selling single of 1980]] in the UK. The song also charted in the top ten in Australia, Canada and the US. The Police won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for this song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winners: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/212 |website=Grammy.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe music and lyrics of the song were written by the lead singer of The Police, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. The song deals with the mixed feelings of lust, fear and guilt that a female student has for a school teacher and vice versa, and inappropriateness leading to confrontation which is unravelled later on in the song. The line ''Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov'' alludes to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Lolita]]'', which covers somewhat similar issues.<ref>{{citation |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1987.2102_65.x|title=Sexism and cultural lag: The rise of the jailbait song, 1955\u20131985 |author=JR Huffman, JL Huffman |journal=The Journal of Popular Culture |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=65\u201383 |year=1987}}</ref> After being criticised for rhyming ''shake and cough'' with ''Nabokov'', Sting replied, \"I've used that terrible, terrible rhyme technique a few times. Technically, it's called a [[feminine rhyme]] \u2013 where it's so appalling it's almost humorous. You don't normally get those type of rhymes in pop music and I'm glad!\"<ref name=sting.com />\n\nBefore joining The Police, Sting had previously worked as an English teacher. Sting said of the song in 1981:\n\n{{quote|I wanted to write a song about sexuality in the classroom. I'd done teaching practice at secondary schools and been through the business of having 15-year-old girls fancying me \u2013 and me really fancying them! How I kept my hands off them I don't know... Then there was my love for ''[[Lolita]]'' which I think is a brilliant novel. But I was looking for the key for eighteen months and suddenly there it was. That opened the gates and out it came: the teacher, the open page, the virgin, the rape in the car, getting the sack, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]], all that.<ref name=sting.com />|Sting|L'Historia Bandido, 1981<ref name=sting.com />}}\n\nIn 1993, however, he said of the song's inspiration, \"You have to remember we were blond bombshells at the time and most of our fans were young girls so I started role playing a bit. Let's exploit that.\"<ref name=sting.com /> In a 2001 interview for the concert DVD ''[[All This Time (Sting album)|...All This Time]]'', Sting denied that the song is autobiographical.\n\n\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" appeared on The Police's album ''[[Zenyatta Mondatta]]'' (A&M), and became a hit No. 1 UK single,<ref name=\"UK Charts\">[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/police/ The Police in the UK Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026172803/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/POLICE/ |date=26 October 2011 }}, The Official Charts.</ref> along with a corresponding music video. In the US, it reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, peaking at No. 10. In the UK, the track was confirmed by the end of 1980 to have been the [[1980 in British music#Top 50 selling singles|biggest selling single of that year]].\n\nThe B-side, \"Friends\", was written by Andy Summers and is inspired by ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', a science fiction novel by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].<ref name=sting.com>{{cite web|title='Don't Stand So Close to Me' / 'Friends'|url=http://www.sting.com/discography/index/ablum/albumId/148/tagName/Singles+(The+Police)|website=sting.com|access-date=19 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023300/http://www.sting.com/discography/index/ablum/albumId/148/tagName/Singles+(The+Police)|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Summers described the track as \"Very quirky. A touch of Long John Silver on Acid.\"<ref name=sting.com />\n\nSting was asked to perform on [[Mark Knopfler]]'s \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\" as he was in [[Montserrat]] at the time, and accidentally reused the melody from \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" in the counterpoint lyric \"I want my MTV.\" It was only after this story was relayed to reporters during promotions for the ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' album that lawyers for Sting became involved, and later copies of the album co-credit the song to Sting. The initial pressings list only Knopfler. It is one of only two shared songwriting credits on any [[Dire Straits]] album.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" features Sting on lead vocals. Like many Police songs, the verses are more subdued, while the chorus is bolder and louder. The song also bears a [[reggae]] style, yet another common trait in Police songs. Thematically, the \"wet bus stop\" idea invites comparison with the 1966 hit song \"[[Bus Stop (song)|Bus Stop]]\" by another English group, [[The Hollies]].\n\nThe track uses a [[guitar synthesizer]] in the middle of the song, which was used by guitarist [[Andy Summers]]. Summers said, \"After Sting had put the vocals on 'Don't Stand So Close To Me' we looked for something to lift the middle of the song. I came up with a guitar synthesiser. It was the first time we'd used it. I felt it worked really well.\"<ref name=sting.com /> The verses and choruses do not feature this effect.<ref name=sting.com />\n\n==Track listing==\n'''7-inch \u2013 A&M / AMS 7564 (UK)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" \u2013 4:03\n# \"Friends\" \u2013 3:37\n\n'''7-inch \u2013 A&M / AMS 2301 (US)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" \u2013 4:03\n# \"A Sermon\" \u2013 2:34\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, bass guitar\n*[[Andy Summers]] \u2013 guitars, guitar synthesizer, vocals in Friends\n*[[Stewart Copeland]] \u2013 drums\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1980\u201381)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|French Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|German Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Italian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[Dutch Top 40]])\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|NZ Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio]])<ref>{{cite web|title=SA Charts 1965\u2013March 1989|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(P).html|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Spain ([[Los 40 Principales]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/lista40/numeros1/1980/|title=N\u00fameros 1 del a\u00f1o 1980 de la Lista LOS40|last=LOS40|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/19810418.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, April 18, 1981 |access-date=15 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603142057/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/19810418.html |archive-date=3 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1981)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia <ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|format=doc|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|title-link=Kent Music Report}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|63\n|-\n|Canada <ref>The 1981 Top 100 Singles chart is identified by the [[RPM Year-End]] article {{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.4689&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=mhe12pta2k83e08udtq66ot062 |title=Top 100 Singles (1981)|publisher=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |accessdate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1981.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1981/Top 100 Songs of 1981|publisher=musicoutfitters.com |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|71\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box'' <ref>http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/1981YESP.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022115158/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/1981YESP.html |date=22 October 2016 }} Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 26, 1981</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== UK chart history ===\n\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\" quickly ascended to {{thinspace|No.|1}} in its first week of release on 27 September 1980,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Virgin Book of Top 40 Charts|last=McAleer|first=David|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7535-2200-4|location=UK|pages=421\u2013424}}</ref> confirming their status as one of the UK's leading contemporary groups.

A new music video was produced for the reworked song by [[Godley and Creme]], notable for its early use of animated [[computer graphics]].\n\nBecause drummer Stewart Copeland had broken his collarbone and was unable to drum, he opted to use his [[Fairlight CMI]] to program the drum track for the single, while singer/bassist Sting pushed to use the drums on his [[Synclavier]] instead. The group's engineer found the Synclavier's programming interface difficult; it ended up taking him two days to complete the task. Copeland ultimately finished the drum programming and claimed that the Fairlight's then-legendary \"Page R\" (the device's sequencing page) saved his life and put him on the map as a composer. In a [[Qantas]] inflight radio program named \"Reeling in the Years\", Copeland was quoted as saying that the argument over Synclavier versus Fairlight drums was \"the straw that broke the camel's back,\" and that this led to the group's unravelling.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAs the Police had already disbanded by the time the 1986 single was released, this, aside from the then-unreleased \"[[De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da '86]],\" was the last recording before the band's reunion and the most recent studio recording the band has released.\n\n==Track listing==\n'''7-inch \u2013 A&M / AM 354 (UK)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\" \u2013 4:47\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" (live) \u2013 3:40\n\n'''12-inch \u2013 A&M / AMY 354 (UK)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\" (dance mix) \u2013 6:32\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me '86\" \u2013 4:47\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" (original version) \u2013 4:03\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" (live) \u2013 3:40\n\n==Charts==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1986)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Spain ([[Los 40 Principales]])\n|align=\"centr\"|1\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n|align=\"centr\"|32\n|-\n|[[Dutch Top 40]]\n|align=\"centr\"|19\n|-\n| Finland ([[Suomen virallinen lista]])<ref>{{cite book | first= Timo | last= Pennanen |year= 2006 | title=Sis\u00e4lt\u00e4\u00e4 hitin \u2013 levyt ja esitt\u00e4j\u00e4t Suomen musiikkilistoilla vuodesta 1972 | publisher=Kustannusosakeyhti\u00f6 Otava | location= Helsinki | language= Finnish }}</ref> \n|style=\"text-align:center;\"| 19\n|-\n|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"centr\"|11\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"centr\"|24\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"centr\"|46\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|align=\"centr\"|27\n|}\n\n==''Glee'' cover==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Don't Stand So Close to Me\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Glee (TV series)|Glee cast]]\n| album      = [[Glee: The Music, Volume 2]]\n| B-side     = [[Young Girl (song)#Glee cover|Young Girl]]\n| released   = 2009\n| format     = [[Music download|Digital download]]\n| recorded   = 2009\n| studio     =\n| venue      =\n| genre      = Pop\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]\n| writer     = [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]\n| producer   = [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Adam Anders]]\n| prev_title = [[I'll Stand by You#Other versions|I'll Stand by You]]\n| prev_year  = 2009\n| next_title = [[Crush (Jennifer Paige song)#Live performances and cover versions|Crush]]\n| next_year  = 2009\n}}\n\nThe song was covered in the episode \"[[Ballad (Glee)|Ballad]]\" of the American television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' in 2009.

It concerns a schoolgirl's crush on her teacher which leads to an affair, which in turn is discovered.\n\nThe band's third {{thinspace|No.|1}} on the [[UK Singles Chart]], it was also the [[1980 in British music#Top 50 selling singles|best selling single of 1980]] in the UK. The song also charted in the top ten in Australia, Canada and the US. The Police won the 1981 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] for this song.<ref>{{cite web |title=Winners: Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/212 |website=Grammy.com |accessdate=21 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe music and lyrics of the song were written by the lead singer of The Police, [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. The song deals with the mixed feelings of lust, fear and guilt that a female student has for a school teacher and vice versa, and inappropriateness leading to confrontation which is unravelled later on in the song. The line ''Just like the old man in that book by Nabokov'' alludes to [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s novel ''[[Lolita]]'', which covers somewhat similar issues.<ref>{{citation |doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1987.2102_65.x|title=Sexism and cultural lag: The rise of the jailbait song, 1955\u20131985 |author=JR Huffman, JL Huffman |journal=The Journal of Popular Culture |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=65\u201383 |year=1987}}</ref> After being criticised for rhyming ''shake and cough'' with ''Nabokov'', Sting replied, \"I've used that terrible, terrible rhyme technique a few times. Technically, it's called a [[feminine rhyme]] \u2013 where it's so appalling it's almost humorous. You don't normally get those type of rhymes in pop music and I'm glad!\"<ref name=sting.com />\n\nBefore joining The Police, Sting had previously worked as an English teacher. Sting said of the song in 1981:\n\n{{quote|I wanted to write a song about sexuality in the classroom. I'd done teaching practice at secondary schools and been through the business of having 15-year-old girls fancying me \u2013 and me really fancying them! How I kept my hands off them I don't know... Then there was my love for ''[[Lolita]]'' which I think is a brilliant novel. But I was looking for the key for eighteen months and suddenly there it was. That opened the gates and out it came: the teacher, the open page, the virgin, the rape in the car, getting the sack, [[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]], all that.<ref name=sting.com />|Sting|L'Historia Bandido, 1981<ref name=sting.com />}}\n\nIn 1993, however, he said of the song's inspiration, \"You have to remember we were blond bombshells at the time and most of our fans were young girls so I started role playing a bit. Let's exploit that.\"<ref name=sting.com /> In a 2001 interview for the concert DVD ''[[All This Time (Sting album)|...All This Time]]'', Sting denied that the song is autobiographical.\n\n\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" appeared on The Police's album ''[[Zenyatta Mondatta]]'' (A&M), and became a hit No. 1 UK single,<ref name=\"UK Charts\">[http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/police/ The Police in the UK Charts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026172803/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/POLICE/ |date=26 October 2011 }}, The Official Charts.</ref> along with a corresponding music video. In the US, it reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, peaking at No. 10. In the UK, the track was confirmed by the end of 1980 to have been the [[1980 in British music#Top 50 selling singles|biggest selling single of that year]].\n\nThe B-side, \"Friends\", was written by Andy Summers and is inspired by ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', a science fiction novel by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].<ref name=sting.com>{{cite web|title='Don't Stand So Close to Me' / 'Friends'|url=http://www.sting.com/discography/index/ablum/albumId/148/tagName/Singles+(The+Police)|website=sting.com|access-date=19 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129023300/http://www.sting.com/discography/index/ablum/albumId/148/tagName/Singles+(The+Police)|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Summers described the track as \"Very quirky. A touch of Long John Silver on Acid.\"<ref name=sting.com />\n\nSting was asked to perform on [[Mark Knopfler]]'s \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\" as he was in [[Montserrat]] at the time, and accidentally reused the melody from \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" in the counterpoint lyric \"I want my MTV.\" It was only after this story was relayed to reporters during promotions for the ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' album that lawyers for Sting became involved, and later copies of the album co-credit the song to Sting. The initial pressings list only Knopfler. It is one of only two shared songwriting credits on any [[Dire Straits]] album.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" features Sting on lead vocals. Like many Police songs, the verses are more subdued, while the chorus is bolder and louder. The song also bears a [[reggae]] style, yet another common trait in Police songs. Thematically, the \"wet bus stop\" idea invites comparison with the 1966 hit song \"[[Bus Stop (song)|Bus Stop]]\" by another English group, [[The Hollies]].\n\nThe track uses a [[guitar synthesizer]] in the middle of the song, which was used by guitarist [[Andy Summers]]. Summers said, \"After Sting had put the vocals on 'Don't Stand So Close To Me' we looked for something to lift the middle of the song. I came up with a guitar synthesiser. It was the first time we'd used it. I felt it worked really well.\"<ref name=sting.com /> The verses and choruses do not feature this effect.<ref name=sting.com />\n\n==Track listing==\n'''7-inch \u2013 A&M / AMS 7564 (UK)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" \u2013 4:03\n# \"Friends\" \u2013 3:37\n\n'''7-inch \u2013 A&M / AMS 2301 (US)'''\n# \"Don't Stand So Close to Me\" \u2013 4:03\n# \"A Sermon\" \u2013 2:34\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Sting (musician)|Sting]] \u2013 lead and backing vocals, bass guitar\n*[[Andy Summers]] \u2013 guitars, guitar synthesizer, vocals in Friends\n*[[Stewart Copeland]] \u2013 drums\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Chart (1980\u201381)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Canadian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|French Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|7\n|-\n|German Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|23\n|-\n|Irish Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|Italian Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Netherlands ([[Dutch Top 40]])\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|NZ Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|2\n|-\n|South Africa ([[Springbok Radio]])<ref>{{cite web|title=SA Charts 1965\u2013March 1989|url=http://www.rock.co.za/files/springbok_top_20_(P).html|accessdate=5 September 2018}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|3\n|-\n|Spain ([[Los 40 Principales]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://los40.com/lista40/numeros1/1980/|title=N\u00fameros 1 del a\u00f1o 1980 de la Lista LOS40|last=LOS40|website=LOS40|language=es|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|UK Singles Chart\n|align=\"center\"|1\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100\n|align=\"center\"|10\n|-\n|US ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' Top 100 <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/19810418.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, April 18, 1981 |access-date=15 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603142057/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/19810418.html |archive-date=3 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|9\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!align=\"left\"|Chart (1981)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Australia <ref name=\"Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992\">{{cite book|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|format=doc|last=Kent|first=David|authorlink=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W |year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|title-link=Kent Music Report}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|63\n|-\n|Canada <ref>The 1981 Top 100 Singles chart is identified by the [[RPM Year-End]] article {{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.4689&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=mhe12pta2k83e08udtq66ot062 |title=Top 100 Singles (1981)|publisher=[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |accessdate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|67\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1981.htm |title=Top 100 Hits of 1981/Top 100 Songs of 1981|publisher=musicoutfitters.com |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|71\n|-\n|US ''Cash Box'' <ref>http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/1981YESP.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022115158/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/80s_files/1981YESP.html |date=22 October 2016 }} Cash Box Year-End Charts: Top 100 Pop Singles, December 26, 1981</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== UK chart history ===\n\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\" quickly ascended to {{thinspace|No.|1}} in its first week of release on 27 September 1980,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Virgin Book of Top 40 Charts|last=McAleer|first=David|publisher=Virgin Books|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7535-2200-4|location=UK|pages=421\u2013424}}</ref> confirming their status as one of the UK's leading contemporary groups.
