The trigger was an altercation between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative MP]] [[Andrew Mitchell]], who resigned from his position as the Government [[Chief Whip]] because of the incident, and the police. Plebgate gained notoriety initially for the conduct claimed of Mitchell and again two months later when, subsequent to Mitchell's resignation, [[CCTV]] and other evidence was revealed which appeared to call into question some of the evidence against him. \n\nLeaked police logs, later apparently backed up by eyewitness evidence, suggested that Mitchell had sworn at police officers on duty at [[Downing Street]] and called them \"[[Pleb#Modern usage|plebs]]\" (a [[pejorative]] word signifying someone of low social class) when they refused to open the main gate for him as he attempted to leave with his bicycle, telling him to walk through the adjacent pedestrian gate instead. Mitchell apologised but denied using the words claimed and in particular calling police officers \"plebs\". However, finding his position untenable amid the media storm surrounding the incident, he resigned from office a month later.\n\nThe story returned to the headlines a few months later, when CCTV footage was released to the media which threw into doubt the police version of events and when it was revealed that an email purporting to be from a member of the public, which had backed up the accounts given in the official police log, was actually sent by a serving police officer who had not been present at the scene. The [[Metropolitan Police]] investigated the incident as Operation Alice.\n\nThe affair was revisited again in October 2013, after a report from the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) concluded three officers had given a false account of a meeting they had with Mitchell at his constituency office in October 2012, and that the findings of a subsequent investigation had been changed just in time to recommend no disciplinary action be taken against them. After both [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] criticised the conduct of the officers involved, the officers issued a statement in which they apologised for misleading the public. At the [[Old Bailey]], PC Keith Wallis subsequently admitted falsely claiming to have witnessed the incident and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.\n\nOnce the criminal trials were out of the way, Mitchell sued for libel. The judge ruled \"on the balance of probabilities\" that Mitchell had said \"the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same including the politically toxic word pleb.\"\n\n==Incident and initial aftermath==\n[[File:Plebgate.jpg|thumb|right|Armed police at the gates to [[Downing Street]]]]\n[[File:Downing.street.gates.london.arp.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian gate to the left, car gates at centre]]\nOn the evening of Wednesday 19 September 2012, at approximately 7:30 pm, Mitchell left the office of the Chief Whip at 9 Downing Street, the street containing the [[official residence]] of the Prime Minister ([[10 Downing Street|Number Ten]]) and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] ([[11 Downing Street|Number 11]]) and therefore under heavy security. Mitchell, who was cycling, swore when a police officer told him to exit Downing Street through the pedestrian gate rather than by the main gate.<ref name=telown>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9764186/Plebgate-Andrew-Mitchell-gives-own-account-of-Downing-Street-exchange.html |title=Plebgate: Andrew Mitchell gives own account of Downing Street exchange |work=The Telegraph |date=23 December 2012}}</ref> The official police log<ref name=fulllog>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/9564006/In-full-Police-log-detailing-Andrew-Mitchells-pleb-rant.html |title=In full: Police log detailing Andrew Mitchell's 'pleb' rant |work=The Telegraph |date=24 September 2012}}</ref> of the incident states that Mitchell said:\n\n{{quote|''\"Best you learn your fucking place.

The trigger was an altercation between [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative MP]] [[Andrew Mitchell]], who resigned from his position as the Government [[Chief Whip]] because of the incident, and the police. Plebgate gained notoriety initially for the conduct claimed of Mitchell and again two months later when, subsequent to Mitchell's resignation, [[CCTV]] and other evidence was revealed which appeared to call into question some of the evidence against him. \n\nLeaked police logs, later apparently backed up by eyewitness evidence, suggested that Mitchell had sworn at police officers on duty at [[Downing Street]] and called them \"[[Pleb#Modern usage|plebs]]\" (a [[pejorative]] word signifying someone of low social class) when they refused to open the main gate for him as he attempted to leave with his bicycle, telling him to walk through the adjacent pedestrian gate instead. Mitchell apologised but denied using the words claimed and in particular calling police officers \"plebs\". However, finding his position untenable amid the media storm surrounding the incident, he resigned from office a month later.\n\nThe story returned to the headlines a few months later, when CCTV footage was released to the media which threw into doubt the police version of events and when it was revealed that an email purporting to be from a member of the public, which had backed up the accounts given in the official police log, was actually sent by a serving police officer who had not been present at the scene. The [[Metropolitan Police]] investigated the incident as Operation Alice.\n\nThe affair was revisited again in October 2013, after a report from the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) concluded three officers had given a false account of a meeting they had with Mitchell at his constituency office in October 2012, and that the findings of a subsequent investigation had been changed just in time to recommend no disciplinary action be taken against them. After both [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] and [[Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] criticised the conduct of the officers involved, the officers issued a statement in which they apologised for misleading the public. At the [[Old Bailey]], PC Keith Wallis subsequently admitted falsely claiming to have witnessed the incident and was sentenced to 12 months in prison.\n\nOnce the criminal trials were out of the way, Mitchell sued for libel. The judge ruled \"on the balance of probabilities\" that Mitchell had said \"the words alleged or something so close to them as to amount to the same including the politically toxic word pleb.\"\n\n==Incident and initial aftermath==\n[[File:Plebgate.jpg|thumb|right|Armed police at the gates to [[Downing Street]]]]\n[[File:Downing.street.gates.london.arp.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian gate to the left, car gates at centre]]\nOn the evening of Wednesday 19 September 2012, at approximately 7:30 pm, Mitchell left the office of the Chief Whip at 9 Downing Street, the street containing the [[official residence]] of the Prime Minister ([[10 Downing Street|Number Ten]]) and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] ([[11 Downing Street|Number 11]]) and therefore under heavy security.

By these names, the divine traits disclose for humans, whose divine potential is hidden, can learn to become a reflection of such names. However, such reflections are limited; the divine traits do not equal the divine essence of the names.<ref>Bruce Lawrence ''The Qur'an: A Biography'' Atlantic Books Ltd, 02.10.2014 {{ISBN|9781782392187}} chapter 8</ref>\n\n== Theophoric given names ==\n{{see also|List of Arabic theophoric names}}\n\nThe Arabic names of God are used to form theophoric given names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, including non-Arabic speaking societies.\n\nBecause the names of God themselves are reserved to God and their use as a person's given name is considered religiously inappropriate, theophoric names are formed by prefixing the term [[Abd (Arabic)|''\u02c1abd'']] (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f: \"slave/servant of\") to the name in the case of male names; in the case of female names, the prefix ''[[Amat (Arabic)|amat]]'' is used in place of \u02c1abd.<ref name=\"muslimnamesworld.com\">[http://www.muslimnamesworld.com/news/information/namegiving/prohibited-muslim-names/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234110/http://www.muslimnamesworld.com/news/information/namegiving/prohibited-muslim-names/|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis distinction is established out of respect for the sanctity of Divine names, which denote attributes (of love, kindness, mercy, compassion, justice, power, etc.) that are believed to be possessed in a full and absolute sense only by God, while human beings, being limited creatures, are viewed by Muslims as being endowed with the Divine attributes only in a limited and relative capacity. The prefixing of the definite article would indicate that the bearer possesses the corresponding attribute in an exclusive sense, a trait reserved to God. \n\nQuranic verse 3:26 is cited as evidence against the validity of using Divine names for persons, with the example of ''M\u0101lik ul-Mulk'' (\u0645\u064e\u0640\u0670\u0644\u0650\u0643\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0644\u0652\u0643\u064f: \"Lord of Power\" or \"Owner of all Sovereignty\"):\n\n{{quote|Say: \"O God! Lord of Power, You give power to whom You please, and You strip off power from whom You please. You endue with honour whom You please, and You bring low whom You please. In Your hand is all Good.\" Verily, over all things You have power.|Quran 3:26}}\n\nThe two parts of the name starting with [[Abd (Arabic)|''\u02c1abd'']] may be written separately (as in the previous example) or combined as one in the transliterated form; in such a case, the vowel transcribed after ''\u02c1abdu'' is often written as u when the two words are transcribed as one: e.g., ''Abdur-Rahman'', ''Abdul-Aziz'', [[Abdul Jabbar|''Abdul-Jabbar'']], or even [[Abdullah (name)|''Abdullah'']] (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0651\u0670\u0647: \"Servant of God\").

By these names, the divine traits disclose for humans, whose divine potential is hidden, can learn to become a reflection of such names. However, such reflections are limited; the divine traits do not equal the divine essence of the names.<ref>Bruce Lawrence ''The Qur'an: A Biography'' Atlantic Books Ltd, 02.10.2014 {{ISBN|9781782392187}} chapter 8</ref>\n\n== Theophoric given names ==\n{{see also|List of Arabic theophoric names}}\n\nThe Arabic names of God are used to form theophoric given names commonly used in Muslim cultures throughout the world, including non-Arabic speaking societies.\n\nBecause the names of God themselves are reserved to God and their use as a person's given name is considered religiously inappropriate, theophoric names are formed by prefixing the term [[Abd (Arabic)|''\u02c1abd'']] (\u0639\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062f\u064f: \"slave/servant of\") to the name in the case of male names; in the case of female names, the prefix ''[[Amat (Arabic)|amat]]'' is used in place of \u02c1abd.<ref name=\"muslimnamesworld.com\">[http://www.muslimnamesworld.com/news/information/namegiving/prohibited-muslim-names/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714234110/http://www.muslimnamesworld.com/news/information/namegiving/prohibited-muslim-names/|date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThis distinction is established out of respect for the sanctity of Divine names, which denote attributes (of love, kindness, mercy, compassion, justice, power, etc.) that are believed to be possessed in a full and absolute sense only by God, while human beings, being limited creatures, are viewed by Muslims as being endowed with the Divine attributes only in a limited and relative capacity.

{"title_page": "George Washington and slavery", "text_new": "[[File:GW-painting.jpg|thumb|right|''George Washington'' ([[John Trumbull]], 1780), with [[William Lee (valet)|William Lee]], Washington's enslaved personal servant|alt=painting]]\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2016}}\n\n'''George Washington''' was a [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father of the United States]] and slaveowner who became uneasy with the institution of slavery but provided for the emancipation of his slaves only after his death. [[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage. Augustine was a tobacco planter with some {{convert|10,000|acre|ha}} of land and 50 slaves. On his death in 1743, he left his {{convert|2,500|acre|ha|adj=on}} Little Hunting Creek to George's older half-brother [[Lawrence Washington (1718\u20131752)|Lawrence]], who renamed it [[Mount Vernon]].

Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

And that was the psycholgical violence of slavery.

Rewards in the form of better blankets and clothing fabric were given to the \"most deserving\", and there are examples of cash payments being awarded for good behavior.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 259\u2013260</ref> He opposed the use of the lash in principle, but saw the practice as a necessary evil and sanctioned its occasional use, generally as a last resort, on both male and female slaves if they did not, in his words, \"do their duty by fair means.\"<ref name=Hirschfeld36 /> There are accounts of carpenters being whipped in 1758 when the overseer \"could see a fault\", of a slave called Jemmy being whipped for stealing corn and escaping in 1773 and of a seamstress called Charlotte being whipped in 1793 by an overseer \"determined to lower Spirit or skin her Back\" for impudence and refusing to work.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 125</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 248, 432 n6 & n7</ref>\n\nWashington regarded the \"passion\" with which one of his overseers administered floggings to be counter-productive, and Charlotte's protest that she had not been whipped in fourteen years indicates the frequency with which physical punishment was used.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 125\u2013126</ref><ref>MVLA Resistance & Punishment</ref> Whippings were administered by overseers after review, a system Washington required to ensure slaves were spared capricious and extreme punishment.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry. The transition left Washington with a surplus of slaves and revealed to him the inefficiencies of the slave labor system.<ref name=Morgan2005p413>Morgan 2005 p. 413</ref><ref name=Twohig118>Twohig 2001 p. 118</ref>\n\nThere is little evidence that Washington seriously questioned the ethics of slavery before the Revolution.<ref name=Twohig118 /> In the 1760s he often participated in tavern lotteries, events in which defaulters' debts were settled by raffling off their assets to a high-spirited crowd.<ref>Chernow 2010 p. 162</ref> In 1769, Washington co-managed one such lottery in which fifty-five slaves were sold, among them six families and five females with children. The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot. Only chance dictated whether the family would remain together, and with 1,840 tickets on sale the odds were not good.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 178\u2013180</ref>\n\nThe historian [[Henry Wiencek]] concludes that the repugnance Washington felt at this cruelty in which he had participated prompted his decision not to break up slave families by sale or purchase, and marks the beginning of a transformation in Washington's thinking about the morality of slavery.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 135, 188</ref> Wiencek writes that in 1775 Washington took more slaves than he needed rather than break up the family of a slave he had agreed to accept in payment of a debt.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 188</ref> The historians [[Philip D.

Morgan writes that in 1772, Washington was \"all business\" and \"might have been buying livestock\" in purchasing more slaves who were to be, in Washington's words, \"strait Limb'd, & in every respect strong & likely, with good Teeth & good Countenance.\" Morgan gives a different account of the 1775 purchase, writing that Washington resold the slave because of the slave's resistance to being separated from family and that the decision to do so was \"no more than the conventional piety of large Virginia planters who usually said they did not want to break up slave families{{snd}}and often did it anyway.\"<ref name=Morgan2005p412>Morgan 2005 p. 412</ref><ref name=Henriques159>Henriques 2008 p. 159</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\n[[File:List of George Washington's taxable property in Truro Parish Virginia including slaves 1788.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Washington's taxable property in April 1788: 121 slaves, 98 horses, 4 mules and a chariot|alt=Original document]]\nFrom the late 1760s, Washington became increasingly radicalized against the North American colonies' subservient status within the [[British Empire]].<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 69</ref> In 1774 he was a key participant in agreeing the [[Fairfax Resolves]] which, alongside the assertion of colonial rights, condemned the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] on moral grounds.<ref>Ferling 2009 p. 75</ref><ref name=Twohig118 /> He began to express the growing rift with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in terms of slavery, stating in the summer of 1774 that the British authorities were \"endeavouring by every piece of Art & despotism to fix the Shackles of Slavry{{sic}}\" upon the colonies. Two years later, on taking command of the [[Continental Army]] at Cambridge at the start of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he wrote in orders to his troops that \"it is a noble Cause we are engaged in, it is the Cause of virtue and mankind...freedom or Slavery must be the result of our conduct.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 p.64</ref> The hypocrisy inherent in slave owners characterizing a war of independence as a struggle for their own freedom from slavery was not lost on the British writer [[Samuel Johnson]], who asked, \"How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 191</ref>\n\nWashington shared the common southern concern about arming African-Americans or slaves and initially refused to accept either into the ranks of the Continental Army. He reversed his position on the recruitment of free African-Americans when the royal governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], issued a [[Dunmore's Proclamation|proclamation]] in November 1775 offering freedom to rebel-owned slaves who enlisted in the British forces.

He sought to liberate himself from an economically unviable system, not to liberate his slaves. They were still a property from which he expected to profit. During a period of severe wartime depreciation, the question was not whether to sell his slaves, but when, where and how best to sell them.

Six of them had been collated into an expensively bound volume titled ''Tracts on Slavery'', indicating that he attached some importance to that selection. Five of the six were published in or after 1788.{{efn|''Tracts on Slavery'' was one volume in a set of thirty-six that Washington had bound probably sometime after 1795. The volumes covered subjects that generally were of importance to him, such as agriculture, the Revolution, the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and politics. The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read. The implication is that Washington became more interested in the subject in the early 1790s.<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 251\u2013253, 260, 263\u2013264</ref>}} All six shared common themes that slaves first had to be educated about the obligations of liberty before they could be emancipated, a belief Washington is reported to have expressed himself in 1798, and that abolition should be realized by a gradual legislative process, an idea that began to appear in Washington's correspondence during the [[Confederation Period|Confederation period]].<ref>Furstenberg 2011 pp. 250\u2013253, 273\u2013275, 285</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\">Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\nWashington was not impressed by what Dorothy Twohig{{snd}}a former editor-in-chief of [[The Washington Papers]]{{snd}}described as the \"imperious demands\" and \"evangelical piety\" of Quaker efforts to advance abolition, and in 1786 he complained about their \"tamper[ing] with & seduc[ing]\" slaves who \"are happy & content to remain with their present masters.\"<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 129</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p419>Morgan 2005 p. 419</ref> Only the most radical of abolitionists called for immediate emancipation.

Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in antislavery movements in France and Great Britain. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to sacrifice abolition on the altar of national unity under a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country. Wiencek suggests Washington considered making precisely such a statement on taking up the presidency in 1789. A passage in the notebook of Washington's biographer [[David Humphreys (soldier)|David Humphreys]]{{efn|Humphreys was a former aide to Washington and had begun an eighteen-month stay at Mount Vernon in 1787 to assist Washington with his correspondence and write his biography.<ref>Ellis 2004 p. 153</ref>}} dated to late 1788 or early 1789 recorded a statement that presaged Washington's emancipation of his slaves in his will a decade later. Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves. It marks, Wiencek believes, a moral epiphany in Washington's thinking, the moment he decided not only to emancipate his slaves but also to use the occasion to set the example Lafayette had urged in 1783.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\">Wiencek 2003 pp. 272\u2013275</ref> Other historians dispute Wiencek's conclusion; Henriques and [[Joseph Ellis]] concur with Philip Morgan's opinion that Washington experienced no epiphanies in a \"long and hard-headed struggle\" in which there was no single turning point. Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between the antislavery North and proslavery South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery.

This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss.

The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families.

Five freedwomen were listed as remaining: an unmarried mother of two children; two women, one of them with three children, married to Washington slaves too old to work; and two women who were married to dower slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 311\u2013312</ref> William Lee remained at Mount Vernon, where he worked as a shoemaker.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 27</ref> After Martha's death on May 22, 1802, most of the remaining dower slaves passed to her grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]], to whom she bequeathed the only slave she held in her own name.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 341, 358</ref>\n\nThere are few records of how the newly freed slaves fared.<ref>Schwartz 2017 p. 35</ref> Custis later wrote that \"although many of them, with a view to their liberation, had been instructed in mechanic trades, yet they succeeded very badly as freemen; so true is the axiom, 'that the hour which makes man a slave, takes half his worth away'.\" The son-in-law of Custis's sister wrote in 1853 that the descendants of those who remained slaves, many of them now in his possession, had been \"prosperous, contented and happy,\" while those who had been freed had led a life of \"vice, dissipation and idleness\" and had, in their \"sickness, age and poverty\", become a burden to his in-laws.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 316</ref> Such reports were influenced by the innate racism of the well-educated, upper-class authors and ignored the social and legal impediments that prejudiced the chances of prosperity for former slaves, which included laws that made it illegal to teach freedpeople to read and write and, in 1806, required newly freed slaves to leave the state.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317, 449 n83</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 215</ref>\n\nThere is evidence that some of Washington's former slaves were able to buy land, support their families and prosper as free people. By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the gazette when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves. Washington was cast as a paternal figure, the benevolent father not only of his country but also of a family of slaves bound to him by affection rather than coercion.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 92\u201394</ref> In this narrative, slaves idolized Washington and wept at his deathbed, and in an 1807 biography, [[Aaron Bancroft]] wrote, \"In domestick{{sic}} and private life, he blended the authority of the master with the care and kindness of the guardian and friend.\"<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 94, 96\u201397</ref> The competing narratives allowed both [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] and [[Confederate States of America|South]] to claim Washington as the father of their countries during the [[American Civil War]] that ended slavery more than half a century after his death.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 100\u2013101</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\nIn 1929, a plaque was embedded in the ground at Mount Vernon less than {{convert|50|yd|m|round=5}} from the crypt housing the remains of Washington and Martha, marking a plot neglected by both groundsmen and tourist guides where slaves had been buried in unmarked graves. The inscription read, \"In memory of the many faithful colored servants of the Washington family, buried at Mount Vernon from 1760 to 1860. Their unidentified graves surround this spot.\" The site remained untended and ignored in the visitor literature until the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association erected a more prominent monument surrounded with plantings and inscribed, \"In memory of the Afro Americans who served as slaves at Mount Vernon this monument marking their burial ground dedicated September 21, 1983.\" In 1985, a [[ground-penetrating radar]] survey identified sixty-six possible burials.

[[Slavery in the colonial United States|Slavery]] was ingrained in the economic and social fabric of [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]], and [[George Washington|Washington]] inherited his first ten slaves at the age of eleven on the death of his father in 1743. In adulthood his personal slaveholding increased through inheritance, purchase and natural increase. In 1759, he gained control of [[Dowry|dower]] slaves belonging to the Custis estate on his marriage to [[Martha Dandridge Custis]]. Washington's early attitudes to slavery reflected the prevailing Virginia [[Planter class|planter]] views of the day, and so he demonstrated no moral qualms about the institution. He became skeptical about the economic efficacy of slavery before the [[American Revolutionary War]], and expressed support in private for abolition by a gradual legislative process after the war. Washington remained dependent on slave labor, and by the time of his death in 1799 there were 317 slaves at his [[Mount Vernon]] estate, 124 owned by Washington and the remainder managed by him as his own property but belonging to other people.\n\nWashington was a demanding master. He provided his slaves with basic food, clothing and accommodation comparable to general practice at the time but not always adequate, and with medical care. In return, he expected them to work diligently from sunrise to sunset over the six-day working week that was standard at the time. Some three-quarters of the slaves labored in the fields, while the remainder worked at the main residence as domestic servants and artisans. They supplemented their diet by hunting, trapping, and growing vegetables in their free time, and bought extra rations, clothing and housewares with income from the sale of game and produce. They built their own community around marriage and family, though because Washington allocated slaves to farms according to the demands of the business without regard for their relationships, many husbands lived separately from their wives and children. Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage and discipline his slaves, but was constantly disappointed when they failed to meet his exacting standards. They resisted enslavement by various means, including theft to supplement food and clothing and as another source of income, by feigning illness, and by running away.\n\nWashington's first doubts about slavery were entirely economic, prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops in the 1760's which left him with a costly surplus of slaves. As commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775, he initially refused to accept African-Americans, free or slave, into the ranks, but reversed this position due to the demands of war. The first indication of moral doubt appeared during efforts to sell some of his slaves in 1778, when Washington expressed his distaste for selling them at a public venue and his desire that slave families not be split up as a result of the sale. His public words and deeds at the end of the American Revolutionary War betrayed no antislavery sentiments. Politically, Washington was concerned that such a divisive issue as [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] should not threaten national unity, and he never spoke publicly about the institution. Privately, Washington considered plans in the mid 1790s to free all the slaves he controlled, but they could not be realized because of his failure to secure his own financial security and the refusal of his family to cooperate. His will provided for the emancipation of his own slaves, the only [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Father]] to do so. Because many of his slaves were married to Martha's dower slaves, whom he could not legally free, Washington stipulated that, with the exception of his valet William Lee who was freed immediately, his slaves be emancipated on the death of Martha. She freed them in 1801, a year before her own death, but her dower slaves were passed to her grandchildren and remained in bondage.\n\n==Background==\n{{See also|History of slavery in Virginia}}\n[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - The First Negro Slaves Brought to Virginia.png|thumb|First slaves arriving in Virginia|alt=Black and white illustration]]\nSlavery was introduced into the English [[colony of Virginia]] when the first Africans were transported to [[Old Point Comfort|Point Comfort]] in 1619. Those who accepted Christianity became \"Christian servants\" with time-limited servitude, or even freed, but this mechanism for ending bondage was gradually shut down. In 1667, the [[Virginia General Assembly|Virginia Assembly]] passed a law that barred [[baptism]] as a means of conferring freedom. Africans who had been baptised before arriving in Virginia could be granted the status of [[Indentured servitude|indentured servant]] until 1682, when another law declared them to be slaves. Whites and people of African descent in the lowest stratum of Virginian society shared common disadvantages and a common lifestyle, which included intermarriage until the Assembly made such unions punishable by banishment in 1691.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 41\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1671, Virginia counted 6,000 white indentured servants among its 40,000 population but only 2,000 people of African descent, up to a third of whom in some counties were free. Towards the end of the 17th century, British policy shifted in favor of retaining cheap labor rather than shipping it to the colonies, and the supply of indentured servants in Virginia began to dry up; by 1715, annual immigration was in the hundreds, compared with 1,500\u20132,000 in the 1680s. As tobacco planters put more land under cultivation, they made up the shortfall in labor with increasing numbers of slaves. The institution was rooted in race with the [[Virginia Slave Codes of 1705]], and from around 1710 the growth in the slave population was fueled by natural increase. Between 1700 and 1750 the number of slaves in the colony increased from 13,000 to 105,000, nearly eighty percent of them born in Virginia.<ref>Wiencek 2003 43\u201346</ref> In Washington's lifetime, slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of Virginia, where some forty percent of the population and virtually all African Americans were enslaved.<ref>Henriques 2008 p. 146</ref>\n\nGeorge Washington was born February 22, 1732, the first child of his father [[Augustine Washington|Augustine]]'s second marriage.

They were kept busy year round, their tasks varying with the season.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 117\u2013118</ref> The remainder worked as domestic servants in the main residence or as artisans, such as carpenters, [[joiner]]s, [[Cooper (profession)|coopers]], [[Hand spinning|spinners]] and seamstresses.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 109\u2013111</ref> Between 1766 and 1799, seven dower slaves worked at one time or another as overseers.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 86, 343\u2013344</ref> Slaves were expected to work from sunrise to sunset over a six-day work week that was standard on Virginia plantations. With two hours off for meals, their workdays would range between seven and a half hours to thirteen hours, depending on season.

This was replaced in 1792 by brick-built accommodation wings either side of the greenhouse comprising four rooms in total, each of some {{convert|600|sqft|m2}}. The [[Mount Vernon Ladies' Association]] have concluded these rooms were communal areas furnished with bunks that allowed little privacy for the predominantly male occupants. Other slaves at Mansion House Farm lived over the outbuildings where they worked or in log cabins.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162\u2013164, 166\u2013167</ref> Such cabins were the standard slave accommodation at the outlying farms, comparable to the accommodation occupied by the lower strata of free white society across the [[Chesapeake Bay|Chesapeake area]] and by slaves on other Virginia plantations.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 162, 167, 169</ref> They provided a single room that ranged in size from 168 square feet (15.6 m2) to 246 square feet (22.9 m2) to house a family.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168\u2013169</ref> The cabins were often poorly constructed, daubed with mud for draft- and water-proofing, with dirt floors. Some cabins were built as duplexes; some single-unit cabins were small enough to be moved on carts.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 168, 170</ref> There are few sources which shed light on living conditions in these cabins, but one visitor in 1798 wrote, \"husband and wife sleep on a mean pallet, the children on the ground; a very bad fireplace, some utensils for cooking, but in the middle of this poverty some cups and a teapot.\" Other sources suggest the interiors were smoky, dirty and dark, with only a shuttered opening for a window and the fireplace for illumination at night.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 170\u2013172</ref>\n\nWashington provided slaves with a blanket each fall at most, which they used for their own bedding and which they were required to use to gather leaves for livestock bedding.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 175\u2013176</ref> Slaves at the outlying farms were issued with a basic set of clothing each year, comparable to the clothing issued on other Virginia plantations. Slaves slept and worked in their clothes, leaving them to spend many months in garments that were worn, ripped and tattered.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 177\u2013178</ref> Domestic slaves at the main residence who came into regular contact with visitors were better clothed; butlers, waiters and body servants were dressed in a [[livery]] based on the three-piece suit of an 18th-century gentleman, and maids were provided with finer quality clothing than their counterparts in the fields.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 179\u2013181</ref>\n\nWashington desired his slaves to be fed adequately but no more.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 244\u2013245</ref> Each slave was provided with a basic daily food ration of {{convert|1|USqt|l|spell=in}} or more of [[cornmeal]], up to {{convert|8|oz|g|spell=in}} of herring and occasionally some meat, a fairly typical ration for slaves in Virginia that was adequate in terms of the calorie requirement for a young man engaged in moderately heavy agricultural labor but nutritionally deficient.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 221\u2013222, 245</ref> The basic ration was supplemented by slaves' own efforts hunting (for which some slaves were allowed guns) and trapping game. They grew their own vegetables in small garden plots they were permitted to maintain in their own time, on which they also reared poultry.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 229\u2013231</ref>\n\nWashington often tipped slaves on his visits to other estates, and it is likely that his own slaves were similarly rewarded by visitors to Mount Vernon. Slaves occasionally earned money through their normal work or for particular services rendered{{snd}}for example, Washington rewarded three of his own slaves with cash for good service in 1775, a slave received a fee for the care of a mare that was being bred in 1798 and the chef [[Hercules (chef)|Hercules]] profited well by selling slops from the presidential kitchen.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 193\u2013194</ref> Slaves also earned money from their own endeavors, by selling to Washington or at the market in [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] food they had caught or grown and small items they had made.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 197, 231</ref> They used the proceeds to purchase from Washington or the shops in Alexandria better clothing, housewares and extra provisions such as flour, pork, whiskey, tea, coffee and sugar.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 194, 195\u2013196, 232</ref>\n\n===Family and community===\n[[File:Slave Cabin interior 01 - Mount Vernon.jpg|thumb|Interior of the reconstructed slave cabin at Mount Vernon|alt=Photograph showing single bedding on a pallet on a dirt floor]]\nAlthough the law did not recognize slave marriages, Washington did, and by 1799 some two-thirds of the adult slaves at Mount Vernon were married.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 128</ref> To minimize time lost in getting to the workplace and thus increase productivity, slaves were accommodated at the farm on which they worked. Because of the unequal distribution of males and females across the five farms, slaves often found partners on different farms, and in their day to day lives husbands were routinely separated from their wives and children. Only thirty-six of the ninety-six married slaves at Mount Vernon in 1799 lived together, while thirty-eight had spouses who lived on separate farms and twenty-two had spouses who lived on other plantations.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 122</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 132\u2013133</ref> The evidence suggests couples that were separated did not regularly visit during the week, and doing so prompted complaints from Washington that slaves were too exhausted to work after such \"night walking\", leaving Saturday nights/Sundays and holidays as the main time such families could spend together.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 134, 136, 202</ref> Despite the stress and anxiety caused by this indifference to family stability{{snd}}on one occasion an overseer wrote that the separation of families \"seems like death to them\"{{snd}}marriage was the foundation on which slaves established their own community, and longevity in these unions was not uncommon.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 127, 130\u2013131, 132</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 123</ref>\n\nLarge families that covered multiple generations, along with their attendant marriages, were part of a slave community-building process that transcended ownership. Washington's head carpenter Isaac, for example, lived with his wife Kitty, a dower-slave milkmaid, at Mansion House Farm. The couple had nine daughters ranging in age from six to twenty-seven in 1799, and the marriages of four of those daughters had extended the family to other farms within and outside the Mount Vernon estate and produced three grandchildren.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\">Thompson 2019 p. 135</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 p. 421</ref> Children were born into slavery, their ownership determined by the ownership of their mothers.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\">Thompson 2019 p. 309</ref> The value attached to the birth of a slave child, if it was noted at all, is indicated in the weekly report of one overseer, which stated, \"Increase 9 Lambs & 1 male child of Lynnas.\" New mothers received a new blanket and three to five weeks of light duties to recover. An infant remained with its mother at her place of work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Older children, the majority of whom lived in single-parent households in which the mother worked from dawn to dusk, performed small family chores but were otherwise left to play largely unsupervised until they reached an age when they could begin to be put to work for Washington, usually somewhere between eleven and fourteen years old.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 158\u2013160</ref> In 1799, nearly sixty percent of the slave population was under nineteen years old and nearly thirty-five percent under nine.<ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 135\"/>\n\nThere is evidence that slaves passed on their African cultural values through telling stories, among them the tales of [[Br'er Rabbit]] which, with their origins in Africa and stories of a powerless individual triumphing through wit and intelligence over powerful authority, would have resonated with the slaves.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 203</ref> African-born slaves brought with them some of the religious rituals of their ancestral home, and there is an undocumented tradition of voodoo being practiced at one of the Mount Vernon farms.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 211\u2013213</ref> Although the slave condition made it impossible to adhere to the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], some slave names betray a Muslim cultural origin.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 213\u2013214</ref> [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] reached out to American-born slaves in Virginia, and some of the Mount Vernon slaves are known to have been christened before Washington acquired the estate. There is evidence in the historical record from 1797 that Mount Vernon slaves had contacts with [[Baptists]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Quakers]].<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 208\u2013209</ref> The three religions advocated abolition, raising hopes of freedom among the slaves, and the congregation of the Alexandria Baptist Church, founded in 1803, included slaves formerly owned by Washington.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 209, 210\u2013211</ref>\n\n===Mulattoes===\nIn 1799 there were some twenty [[mulatto]] (mixed race) slaves at Mount Vernon. The probability of paternal relationships between slaves and hired white workers is indicated by some surnames: Betty and Tom Davis, probably the children of Thomas Davis, a white weaver at Mount Vernon in the 1760s; George Young, likely the son of a man of the same name who was a clerk at Mount Vernon in 1774; and [[Oney Judge]] and her sister Delphy, the daughters of Andrew Judge, an indentured tailor at Mount Vernon in the 1770s and 1780s.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 138\u2013139</ref> There is evidence to suggest that white overseers{{snd}}working in close proximity to slaves under the same demanding master and physically and socially isolated from their own peer group, a situation that drove some to drink{{snd}}indulged in sexual relations with the slaves they supervised.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 140\u2013141</ref> Some white visitors to Mount Vernon seemed to have expected slave women to provide sexual favors.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 141\u2013142</ref> The living arrangements left some slave females alone and vulnerable, and the Mount Vernon research historian Mary V. Thompson writes that relationships \"could have been the result of mutual attraction and affection, very real demonstrations of power and control, or even exercises in the manipulation of an authority figure.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 136, 140</ref>{{efn|There is an oral tradition among the descendants of the freedman [[West Ford (slave)|West Ford]] that he was the son of Washington and Venus, a slave belonging to Washington's brother [[John Augustine Washington]]. A case made by the historian Henry Wiencek is, according to the historian Philip Morgan, \"so circumstantial as to be fanciful,\" and there is no evidence that Washington ever met Venus, let alone fathered a child by her.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 147\u2013151</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 419, 420 n26</ref>}}\n\n===Resistance===\n[[File:Oney Judge Runaway Ad.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement placed in the ''Pennsylvania Gazette'' after Oney Judge absconded from the President's House in 1796|alt=Newspaper clipping]]\nThe frequent comments Washington made about \"rogueries\" and \"old tricks\" indicate the resistance displayed by the slaves against the system.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 261</ref> The most common act of resistance was theft, so common that Washington made allowances for it as part of normal wastage. Food was stolen both to supplement rations and to sell, and Washington believed the selling of tools was another source of income for slaves. Because cloth and clothing were commonly stolen, Washington required seamstresses to show the results of their work and the leftover scraps before issuing them with more material. Sheep were washed before shearing to prevent the theft of wool, and storage areas were kept locked and keys left with trusted individuals.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 269\u2013271</ref> In 1792, Washington ordered the culling of slaves' dogs he believed were being used in a spate of livestock theft and ruled that slaves who kept dogs without authorization were to be \"severely punished\" and their dogs hanged.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 201</ref>\n\nAnother means by which slaves resisted, one that was virtually impossible to prove, was feigning illness. Over the years Washington became increasingly skeptical about absenteeism due to sickness among his slaves and concerned about the diligence or ability of his overseers in recognizing genuine cases. Between 1792 and 1794, while Washington was away from Mount Vernon as President, the number of days lost to sickness increased tenfold compared to 1786, when he was resident at Mount Vernon and able to control the situation personally. In one case, Washington suspected a slave of frequently avoiding work over a period of decades through acts of deliberate self harm.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 261\u2013263, 264\u2013265</ref>\n\nSlaves asserted some independence and frustrated Washington by the pace and quality of their work.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 105, 265</ref> In 1760, Washington noted that four of his carpenters quadrupled their output of timber under his personal supervision.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 93\u201394</ref> Thirty-five years later, he described his carpenters as an \"idle...set of rascals\" who would take a month or more to complete at Mount Vernon work that was being done in two or three days in [[Philadelphia]]. The output of seamstresses dropped off when Martha was away, and spinners found they could slacken by playing the overseers off against Martha.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266\u2013267</ref> Tools were regularly lost or damaged, thus stopping work, and Washington despaired of employing innovations that might improve efficiency because he believed the slaves were too clumsy to operate the new machinery involved.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 266, 268</ref>\n\nThe most emphatic act of resistance was to run away, and between 1760 and 1799 at least forty-seven slaves under Washington's control did so.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 275</ref> Seventeen of these, fourteen men and three women, escaped to a British warship that anchored in the [[Potomac River]] near Mount Vernon in 1781.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 278, 279</ref> In general, the best chance of success lay with second- or third-generation African-American slaves who had good English, possessed skills that would allow them to support themselves as free people and were in close enough contact with their masters to receive special privileges. Thus it was that Judge, an especially talented seamstress, and Hercules escaped in 1796 and 1797 respectively and eluded recapture.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 281, 284\u2013286</ref> Washington took seriously the recapture of fugitives, and in three cases an escaped slave was sold off in the West Indies after recapture, effectively a death sentence in the severe conditions slaves had to endure there.<ref name=\"Wiencek 2003 p. 132\">Wiencek 2003 p. 132</ref><ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 411\u2013412</ref><ref>Chernow 2010 p. 161</ref>\n\n===Control===\n{{Quote box\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|width=25%\n|quote=Slavery was a system in which enslaved people lived in fear; fear of being sold, fear of being separated from their families or their children or their parents, fear of not being in control of their bodies or their lives, fear of never knowing freedom.

By 1766, he had transitioned his business from the labor-intensive planting of tobacco to the less demanding farming of grain crops. His slaves were employed on a greater variety of tasks that needed more skills than tobacco planting required of them; as well as the cultivation of grains and vegetables, they were employed in cattle herding, spinning, weaving and carpentry.

The more valuable married males were raffled together with their wives and children; less valuable slaves were separated from their families into different lots. Robin and Bella, for example, were raffled together as husband and wife while their children, twelve-year-old Sukey and seven-year-old Betty, were listed in a separate lot.

The single pre-1788 pamphlet of the six in ''Tracts on Slavery'' was ''A Serious Address to the Rulers of America, on the Inconsistency of Their Conduct Respecting Slavery'', published in 1783. It was the first pamphlet in the volume, and Washington had written his signature on the cover, as he did with the first pamphlet in each of the thirty-six volumes. Of the eleven pamphlets on slavery that were, presumably, not considered to be worth binding, eight were published before 1788. One of them, published in 1785, was never read.

Lafayette had taken concerns about the abrupt emancipation of slaves into account, paying and educating the slaves he settled on the plantation before freeing them. He became a leading figure in antislavery movements in France and Great Britain. Washington would not have known of Lafayette's antislavery activities in Cayenne or Europe from Lafayette himself; although the two continued to correspond for the rest of Washington's life, the subject of slavery virtually disappeared from their letters.

He presided over the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, during which it became obvious just how explosive the issue was and how willing the antislavery faction was to sacrifice abolition on the altar of national unity under a strong federal government. The support of the southern states for the new constitution was secured by granting them concessions that protected slavery, including the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] and the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]], plus clauses that guaranteed the transatlantic slave trade for at least twenty years and federal aid for the suppression of any slave rebellion.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 422</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 124\u2013125</ref>\n\nWashington's preeminent position ensured that any actions he took with regard to his own slaves would become a statement in a national debate about slavery that threatened to divide the country.

Wiencek argues the passage was a draft for a public announcement Washington was considering in which he would declare the emancipation of some of his slaves.

Morgan argues that Humphreys' passage is the \"private expression of remorse\" from a man unable to extricate himself from the \"tangled web\" of \"mutual dependency\" on slavery, and that Washington believed public comment on such a divisive subject was best avoided for the sake of national unity.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 421\u2013423, 425</ref><ref>Ellis 2004 p. 311 n22</ref><ref name=Henriques159 />{{efn|Wiencek bases his argument on the fact that the passage was written in the past tense and appears in Humphreys' notebook amid drafts Humphreys had written for public statements Washington was to make about assuming the presidency.<ref name=\"Wiencek272\u2013275\" /> Philip Morgan points out that the passage was Humphreys' words in Washington's voice and appears just after a summary Humphreys had written of [[Thomas Clarkson]]'s 1788 ''An Essay on the Impolicy of the African Slave Trade''.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 423 n31</ref> Kenneth Morgan characterizes the passage as \"a remark made in [Washington's] voice by David Humphreys.\"<ref name=Morgan2000p298 /> Fritz Hirschfeld writes that the passage was written by Humphreys during direct dictation or from memory of Washington's exact words, and believes it highly improbable that they were not Washington's own words.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 213 n5</ref>}}\n\n====As President====\n{{See also|Presidency of George Washington}}\n[[File:George Washington 1795.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|''President George Washington'' by Gilbert Stuart (1795) |alt=Portrait painting]]\nWashington took up the presidency at a time when revolutionary sentiment against slavery was giving way to a resurgence of proslavery interests.

Washington understood there was little widespread organized support for abolition.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 125\u2013126</ref> He had a keen sense both of the fragility of the fledgling Republic and of his place as a unifying figure, and he was determined not to endanger either by confronting an issue as divisive and entrenched as slavery.<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 126\u2013128</ref><ref>Morgan 2000 pp. 290, 295</ref> He presided over an administration that passed a resolution in 1790 affirming states' rights to regulate treatment of slaves and legislate on slavery free of congressional interference, provided materiel and financial support in French efforts to suppress the [[Haitian Revolution|Saint Domingue slave revolt]] in 1791 and implemented the proslavery [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 275\u2013276</ref><ref>Twohig 2001 p. 130</ref><ref name=Morgan2000-297>Morgan 2000 p. 297</ref> He also signed into law the [[Slave Trade Act of 1794]] that sought to limit American involvement in the [[Atlantic slave trade|international slave trade]].<ref>Stathis 2014 pp. 17\u201318</ref> Washington never spoke publicly on the issue of slavery during his eight years as president, nor did he respond to, much less act upon, any of the antislavery petitions he received. He described a 1790 Quaker petition to [[United States Congress|Congress]] urging an immediate end to the slave trade as \"an illjudged piece of business\" that \"occasioned a great waste of time.\" The issue of slavery was not mentioned in either his last address to Congress or his [[George Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]].<ref>Twohig 2001 p. 126</ref><ref>Boller 1961 pp. 85, 87</ref><ref>Ferling 2009 p. 363</ref>\n\nLate in his presidency, Washington told his [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Edmund Randolph]], that in the event of a confrontation between the antislavery North and proslavery South, he had \"made up his mind to remove and be of the Northern.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 362</ref> In 1798, he imagined just such a conflict when he said, \"I can clearly foresee that nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union.\"<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 361\u2013362</ref><ref name=\"Hirschfeld 1997 pp. 72\u201373\"/> But there is no indication Washington ever favored an immediate end to slavery. His abolitionist aspirations for the nation were confined to the hope that slavery would disappear naturally over time with the [[Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves|prohibition of slave imports]] in 1808, the earliest date such legislation could be passed as agreed at the Constitutional Convention.<ref name=Twohig131 /><ref>Morgan 2000 p. 296</ref>\n\n====As Virginia farmer====\nIn addition to political caution, economic imperatives remained an important consideration with regard to Washington's personal position as a slaveholder and his efforts to free himself from his dependency on slavery.<ref name=Twohig128>Twohig 2001 p. 128</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p423>Morgan 2005 p. 423</ref> He was one of the largest debtors in Virginia at the end of the war,<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 92</ref> and by 1787 the business at Mount Vernon had failed to make a profit for more than a decade.

Washington concluded his instructions with a private passage in which he expressed his repugnance at owning slaves and declared the principle reason for selling the land was to raise the finances that would allow him to liberate them.<ref name=Twohig128 /><ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 273\u2013274</ref> It is the first clear indication that Washington's thinking had shifted from selling his slaves to freeing them.<ref name=Ellis257 /> In November the same year, Washington demonstrated in a letter to his friend and neighbor Alexander Spotswood that the reluctance to sell slaves at a public venue, first seen in his letter to Lund Washington in 1778, had become an emphatic principle against \"selling Negroes, as you would Cattle in the market...\"<ref>Twohig 2001 pp. 128, 137 n45</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 16</ref>\n\nIn 1795 and 1796, Washington devised a complicated plan that involved renting out his western lands to tenant farmers to whom he would lease his own slaves, and a similar scheme to lease the dower slaves he controlled to Dr. [[David Stuart (Virginia politician)|David Stuart]] for work on Stuart's Eastern Shore plantation. This plan would have involved breaking up slave families, but it was designed with an end goal of raising enough finances to fund their eventual emancipation (a detail Washington kept secret) and prevent the Custis heirs from permanently splitting up families by sale.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 339\u2013342</ref><ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 303\u2013304</ref>{{efn|The dower slaves had already begun to be transferred to Martha's granddaughters as the Custis heirs married.

Peter had begun selling off slaves soon after his marriage, splitting up families and systematically separating girls as young as four years old from their parents. Wiencek suggests Martha's servant [[Oney Judge|Ona Judge]], who as a dower slave was destined to become Custis property, fled from Philadelphia in 1796 to avoid being sold.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 338\u2013342</ref>}} None of these schemes could be realized because of his failure to sell or rent land at the right prices, the refusal of the Custis heirs to agree to them and his own reluctance to separate families.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 423\u2013424</ref><ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 342</ref> Wiencek speculates that, because Washington gave such serious consideration to freeing his slaves knowing full well the political ramifications that would follow, one of his goals was to make a public statement that would sway opinion towards abolition.<ref>Wiencek 2003 pp. 342\u2013343</ref> Philip Morgan argues that Washington freeing his slaves while President in 1794 or 1796 would have had no profound effect, and would have been greeted with public silence and private derision by white southerners.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 428\u2013429</ref>\n\nAs Washington subordinated his desire for emancipation to his efforts to secure financial independence, he took care to retain his slaves.<ref>Ellis 2004 pp. 258\u2013260</ref> In 1791, he arranged for those who served in his personal retinue while he was President in Philadelphia to be rotated out of the state before they became eligible for emancipation after six months residence per [[An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery|Pennsylvanian law]]. Not only would Washington have been deprived of their services if they were freed, most of the slaves he took with him to Philadelphia were dower slaves, which meant that he would have had to compensate the Custis estate for the loss. Because of his concerns for his public image and that the prospect of emancipation would generate discontent among the slaves before they became eligible for emancipation, he instructed that they be shuffled back to Mount Vernon \"under pretext that may deceive both them and the Public.\"<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 59\u201360</ref>\n\nWashington spared no expense in efforts to recover Hercules and Judge when they absconded. In Judge's case, Washington persisted for three years. He tried to persuade her to return when his agent eventually tracked her to New Hampshire, but refused to promise her freedom after his death; \"However well disposed I might be to a gradual emancipation,\" he said, \"or even to an entire emancipation of that description of People (if the latter was in itself practicable at this moment) it would neither be politic or just to reward unfaithfulness with a premature preference.\" Both Hercules and Judge eluded capture.<ref name=\"Ellis 2004 p. 260\"/> Washington's search for a new chef to replace Hercules in 1797 is the last known instance in which he considered buying a slave, despite his resolve \"never to become the Master of another Slave by purchase\", though in the end he chose to hire a white chef.<ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 15</ref>\n\n==Posthumous emancipation==\n[[File:GW-will.jpg|thumb|Washington's will published in the Connecticut Journal, February 20, 1800|alt=newspaper clipping]]\nIn July 1799, five months before his death, Washington wrote his will, in which he stipulated that his slaves should be freed. In the months that followed, he considered a plan that betrayed a continuing prioritization of profit above his concerns about the institution of slavery. The plan involved repossessing tenancies in [[Berkeley County, West Virginia|Berkeley]] and [[Frederick County, Virginia|Frederick]] Counties and transferring half of his Mount Vernon slaves to work them. It would, Washington hoped, \"yield more nett profit\" which might \"benefit myself and not render the [slaves'] condition worse\", despite the disruption such relocation would have had on the slave families. The plan died with Washington on December 14, 1799.<ref>Morgan 2005 pp. 404, 424</ref>{{efn|Philip Morgan speculates on the unlikely possibility that, had the plan proved profitable, Washington might have changed his will and retracted the manumission of his slaves.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 425</ref>}}\n\nWashington's slaves were the subjects of the longest provisions in the twenty-nine-page will, taking three pages in which his instructions were more forceful than in the rest of the document. His valet, William Lee, was freed immediately and his remaining 123 slaves were to be emancipated on the death of Martha.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 5</ref><ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> The deferral was intended to postpone the pain of separation that would occur when his slaves were freed but their spouses among the dower slaves remained in bondage, a situation which affected twenty couples and their children. It is possible Washington hoped Martha and her heirs who would inherit the dower slaves would solve this problem by following his example and emancipating them.<ref>Wiencek 2003 p. 354</ref><ref>Hirschfeld 1997 p. 216</ref><ref name=\"Thompson 2019 p. 309\"/> Those too old or infirm to work were to be supported by his estate, as mandated by state law. Washington went beyond the legal requirement to support and maintain younger slaves until adulthood, stipulating that those children whose education could not be undertaken by parents were to be taught reading, writing and a useful trade by their masters and then be freed at the age of twenty-five.<ref>Thompson 2019 p. 294</ref> Washington was particularly pointed in forbidding the sale or transportation of any of his slaves out of Virginia before their emancipation.<ref name=Morgan2005p404 /> Including the Dandridge slaves, who were emancipated under similar terms, more than 160 slaves were freed.<ref name=\"Morgan2005pp404\u2013405\" /><ref name=gwpapers /> Although he was not alone among Virginian slaveowners in freeing their slaves, he was the only Founding Father to do so.<ref>Morgan 2005 p. 427</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Slave Memorial - Mt.

By 1812, Free Town in [[Truro Parish, Virginia|Truro Parish]], the earliest known free African-American settlement in Fairfax County, contained seven households of former Washington slaves. By the mid 1800s, a son of Washington's carpenter Davy Jones and two grandsons of his [[postilion]] Joe Richardson had each bought land in Virginia. Francis Lee, younger brother of William, was well known and respected enough to have his obituary printed in the ''Alexandria Gazette'' on his death at Mount Vernon in 1821. Sambo Anderson{{snd}}who hunted game, as he had while Washington's slave, and prospered for a while by selling it to the most respectable families in Alexandria{{snd}}was similarly noted by the gazette when he died near Mount Vernon in 1845.<ref>Thompson 2019 pp. 317\u2013319</ref> Research published in 2019 has concluded that Hercules worked as a cook in New York, where he died on May 15, 1812.<ref>Ganeshram 2019</ref>\n\nA decade after Washington's death, the Pennsylvanian jurist [[Richard Peters (Continental Congress)|Richard Peters]] wrote that Washington's servants \"were devoted to him; and especially those more immediately about his person.

Washington \"disdained to hold his fellow-creatures in abject domestic servitude,\" wrote the Massachusetts Federalist [[Timothy Bigelow (lawyer)|Timothy Bigelow]] before calling on \"fellow-citizens in the South\" to emulate Washington's example. In this narrative, Washington was a proto-abolitionist who, having added the freedom of his slaves to the freedom from British slavery he had won for the nation, would be mobilized to serve the antislavery cause.<ref>Furstenberg 2006 pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nAn alternative narrative more in line with proslavery sentiments embraced rather than excised Washington's ownership of slaves.

The war arose from the long-running dispute between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] groups within the Rwandan population. A [[Rwandan Revolution|1959\u20131962 revolution]] had replaced the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in [[Uganda]] founded the RPF which, under the leadership of [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]], became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.\n\nThe war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the [[Virunga Mountains]] for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by [[Hutu Power]], a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] in August 1993.\n\nAn uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \"final solution\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination of President Habyarimana]] on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, [[Kigali]], and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and ''genocidaires'' into [[Zaire]].\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as [[Vice President of Rwanda|vice president]] from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the [[First Congo War]], which removed long-time dictator President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Pre-independence Rwanda and origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa===\n{{main|Origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa}}\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the [[King of Rwanda]]'s palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]]|alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof]]\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now [[Rwanda]] were the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], and the [[Tutsi]] migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the [[Horn of Africa]].{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial,  distinction.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe population coalesced, first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] (''ubwoko''){{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} expanding through conquest and assimilation.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=38}} It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]] in 1853\u20131895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} {{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}} Rwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=17}} The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=217\u2013218}} [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi]] during World War I,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25\u201326}} and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=32\u201335}} They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=35}} Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=38\u201339}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n===Revolution, exile of Tutsi, and the Hutu republic===\n{{main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=108}} demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}} The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}}{{sfn|Kroslak|2007|p=24}} There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were [[Flemish people|Flemish]] rather than [[Walloons|Walloon]] Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=113}} In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists.{{sfn|Carney|2013|pp=124\u2013125}} Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the [[Rwandan Revolution]].{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=125}} The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians,{{sfn|Newbury|1988|pp=195\u2013196}} but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel [[Guy Logiest]], who was brought in by the colonial Governor.{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=127}} He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|King Kigeli V]] into exile.{{sfn|Sabar|2013}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb| Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] (pictured) became President of Rwanda after [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1973 coup]].]]\nLogiest and Hutu leader [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]] declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=53\u201354}} More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=62}}{{sfn|Mayersen|2010|p=21}} mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, [[Tanzania]] and Zaire.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=160\u2013161}} Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=63\u201364}} and sought to return to Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}} These groups were known in [[Kinyarwanda]] as the ''inyenzi'' (cockroaches).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=54}} Historians do not know the origin of this term \u2013 it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}}\n\nKayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=57}} In 1973 Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] toppled Kayibanda in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} He founded the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND) party in 1975,{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=117}} and promulgated a new constitution following a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 referendum]], making the country a [[one-party state]] in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=116}} Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to [[foreign aid]] receipts.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=84}} The family of first lady [[Agathe Habyarimana]], known as the ''[[akazu]]'', were the principal winners in this fight.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=85}} The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near [[Gisenyi]] in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The ''akazu'' exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the [[national budget]], which led to civil unrest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=87\u201389}} On the advice of French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Habyarimana declared a commitment to [[Multi-party system|multi-party politics]] but took no action to bring this about.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}} Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}}\n\n=== Formation of the RPF and preparation for war ===\nThe organisation which became the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, [[Idi Amin]], including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin.{{sfn|Dash|1983}} Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]] had joined [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel [[Front for National Salvation]] (FRONASA).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=68}} Museveni [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|fought alongside Obote]] to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the [[Ugandan general election, 1980|1980 general election]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA).{{sfn|Associated Press (I)|1981}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the [[Ugandan Bush War]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Nganda|2009}} President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to [[Nairobi]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=63}} In 1982, with the authority of Obote,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} local district councils in the [[Ankole]] region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=19}} These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} Faced with the threat of statelessness,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=70}}\n[[File:ReaganMuseveni.jpg|thumb|Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] meeting with [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in October 1987]]\nIn 1986 the NRA [[Battle of Kampala|captured Kampala]] with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=47}} After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Simpson (I)|2000}} The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala.{{sfn|Wells|Fellows|2016|p=29}} At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=72\u201373}} In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing [[Peter Bayingana]] as RPF president.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=31}}\n\nRwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} At the same time many native Ugandans and [[Baganda]] officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=33}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=175}} He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=53\u201354}} In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=176}} led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=182}} Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=57}} It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=97\u201398}} In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the [[Command and General Staff College]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=61\u201362}} Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=62}}\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== 1990 invasion and death of Rwigyema ===\nOn 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan national army]] and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and Soviet [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21 multiple rocket launchers]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=65}} Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in [[New York City]] attending the United Nations [[World Summit for Children]].{{sfn|Biles|1990}} In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} south to [[Gabiro]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} Their [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}}\n\nOn 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda|2009}} and the version mentioned by historian [[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=95\u201396}} In his 2009 book ''Africa's World War'', Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander [[Chris Bunyenyezi]] wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Another senior RPF officer, [[Stephen Nduguta]], witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother [[Salim Saleh]] to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=14}}\n\nWhen news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French president's son, [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand]], was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger.{{refn|group=note|Many sources report that the attack was staged:{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua also finds that the most convincing explanation, but writes that it remains open to debate.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}}}} As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French operation was code-named [[Op\u00e9ration Noro\u00eet|Noro\u00eet]] and its official purpose was to protect French nationals.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|p=27}} In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and [[Kigali International Airport]].{{sfn|Melvern|2000|p=14}} Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=107}} Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=107\u2013108}} Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=88}} Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} but their discipline was poor.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=78}} With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the [[Akagera National Park]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \"rear command\" for the group in Kampala, and \"flagging off\" the invasion.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=116}} The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}} Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; [[Radio Rwanda]] aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=16}} It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated,{{sfn|Longman|2017|p=126}} as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}\n\n=== Kagame's reorganisation of the RPF ===\n[[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|The [[Virunga Mountains]], the RPF base from 1990 to 1991|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga Mountains behind, partially in cloud]]\nPaul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=63}} At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=67}} He flew through [[London]] and [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]], where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service;{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=75\u201376}} the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}}\n\nThe RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=78\u201379}} He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the [[Virunga mountains]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=114\u2013115}} The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}\n\nMeanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]] to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}} The reorientation towards [[guerrilla warfare]] began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from [[Katuna]].{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=112\u2013113}} Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=114}} The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nConditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost {{convert|5000|m|ft}},{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the [[Alpine climate|high-altitude cold climate]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} [[Alexis Kanyarengwe]], a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Another Hutu, [[Seth Sendashonga]], became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=116}} Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}}\n\nThe RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner [[Aloisia Inyumba]] in Kampala.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=82}} as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=117}} The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to G\u00e9rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni later said that \"faced with [a] ''fait accompli'' situation by our Rwandan brothers\", Uganda went \"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\".{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=183}} Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal \"nearly got depleted\"; he suspected that the war \"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\", costing the country \"trillions of shillings\".{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=117, 121}}\n\n=== Attack on Ruhengeri, January 1991 ===\n[[File:Ruhengeri.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Ruhengeri]], with the [[Virunga Mountains]] in the background|alt=Photograph of Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with buildings, a street, and people visible, and mountains in the background, partially in cloud]]\nAfter three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} The target for the first attack was the northern city of [[Ruhengeri]],{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} south of the Virunga mountains.{{sfn|ITMB Publishing}} The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}}\n\nDuring the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} They attacked on the morning of 23 January.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Most of the civilian population fled.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}}\n\nOne of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} When he learnt of the invasion the warden, {{interlanguage link|Charles Uwihoreye|fr}}, telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} He spoke to Colonel [[Elie Sagatwa]], one of the ''akazu'', who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including [[Th\u00e9oneste Lizinde]], a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}}\n\nThe RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}} The government sent troops to the city the following day and a [[state of emergency]] was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}\n\n=== Guerrilla war, 1991\u20131992 ===\nFollowing the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=90}} Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of [[Gatuna]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of [[Mombasa]] via the [[Northern Corridor]], forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier [[Central Corridor (Africa)|Central Corridor]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near [[Mulindi]], Byumba province.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=96}} Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of [[internally displaced persons]] in the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=136}}\n\nThe renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30\u201360 [[Bagogwe]] Tutsi pastoralists near [[Kinigi]] and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} The ''akazu'' also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}} This included the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], a set of \"rules\" published in the ''[[Kangura]]'' magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=92\u201394}} In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, [[Radio Muhabura]], which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-10.htm Propaganda and Practice]}}\n\nThe second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] (MDR), [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] (PL),{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=123\u2013124}} but the one-party state law had remained in place.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=66\u221267}} Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR),{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=69}} which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the ''akazu''.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}}\n\nProgress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=134}} Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=145}} The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of [[Arusha]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=150}}\n\n===Peace process, 1992\u20131993===\nThe peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \"democratic\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=151}} The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}}\n\nThe delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} In August the parties agreed a \"pluralistic transitional government\", which would include the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=163}} they began killing Tutsi civilians in the [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} Historian G\u00e9rard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=140\u2212141}} This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} MRND national secretary [[Mathieu Ngirumpatse]] announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\n===RPF offensive, February 1993===\n[[File:RwandaTerritoryAfterFeb1993.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The partition of Rwanda following the RPF offensive in February 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=xx}} For the first time, the Rwandan Government acknowledged that it had lost part of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}}|alt=Map showing the partition of Rwanda between government, RPF, and demilitarised zones.]]\nPaul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=80}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar [[Bruce D. Jones]] the offensive may actually have been intended primarily to increase the rebels' bargaining power at the peace talks.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} The next subject for the negotiations was the proportion of troops and officers to be allocated to each side in the new unified army. By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\nThe RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991\u20131992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the [[Rwandan franc]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=159}} had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}\n\nThe RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} and later the city of [[Byumba]]. Local Hutu civilians fled ''en masse'' from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua several thousand were killed,{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}} while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \"small-scale\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}}\n\nWhen it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}} A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\nBy 20 February the RPF had advanced to within {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of the capital, [[Kigali]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} Kagame told journalist and author [[Stephen Kinzer]] that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}} By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}By Bosco\n\n===Arusha Accords and rise of Hutu Power, 1993\u20131994===\n{{main|Arusha Accords (Rwanda)}}\n[[File:AICC Arusha.jpg|thumb|The [[Arusha International Conference Centre]], venue for peace talks to end the war|alt=Photograph showing the front entrance of the Arusha International Conference Centre]]\nThe RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital [[Kampala]], attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=107}}\n\nDespite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} spent the subsequent months forging a \"common front\" against the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} The hardline factions within the parties became known as [[Hutu Power]], a movement which transcended party politics.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Instead almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\nBy June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The government eventually agreed to their demands.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army.{{sfn|IPEP|2000|pp=49\u201350}} With all details agreed the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=191}}\n\nAn uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations [[peacekeeping]] force; this was titled the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=98}} under the command of Canadian General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=42}} Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the ''Conseil national de d\u00e9veloppement'' (CND), now known as the [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)|Chamber of Deputies]], Rwanda's Parliament building.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} These men were protected by 600\u20131,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's [[Operation Clean Corridor]] in December 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The President of Burundi, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, [[1993 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|was assassinated]] by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=199}} The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The idea of a \"final solution\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} An informant from the ''Interahamwe'' told UNAMIR officials that a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Greg Barker (Director)| title = Ghosts of Rwanda| medium = Television production| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| date = 1 April 2004| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/}}</ref>\n\n===Military operations during the 1994 genocide===\n{{main|Rwandan genocide}}\n[[File:RPF advance Rwandan Genocide cropped 1994.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994.{{sfn|Kuperman|2001|p=41}}|alt=Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994]]\nThe cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was shot down]] near [[Kigali Airport]], killing both Habyarimana and the new [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President of Burundi]], [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]].{{sfn|National Assembly of France|1998}}{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2010}} The pair were returning home from a regional summit in [[Dar es Salaam]] at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=211}} The attackers remain unknown.

A crisis committee was formed by the military, headed by Colonel Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora, which refused to recognise Prime Minister [[Agathe Uwilingiyimana]] as leader, even though she was legally next in the line of political succession.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=224}} UN commander General Dallaire labelled this a coup and insisted that Uwilingiyimana be placed in charge, but Bagosora refused.{{sfn|McGreal|2008}}{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=224}} The Presidential Guard killed Uwilingiyimana and her husband during the night, along with ten Belgian UNAMIR soldiers charged with her protection{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|p=114}} and other prominent moderate politicians and journalists.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=231}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=230}} The crisis committee appointed an interim government, still effectively controlled by Bagosora,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, as well as some politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=386}} Over the course of approximately 100 days between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.{{sfn|Henley|2007}}{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=386}}\n\nOn 7 April, as the genocide started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the interim government and the United Nations peacekeepers that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=247}} The next day Rwandan Army forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|pp=264\u2013265}} The RPF then crossed the demilitarised zone from their territory in the north and began an attack on three fronts, leaving their opponents unsure of their true intentions or whether an assault on Kigali was imminent. UNAMIR contingents in the demilitarised zone withdrew to their camps to avoid being caught in the fighting.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=269}} Kagame refused to talk to the interim government, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule and not committed to ending the genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} Over the next few days the RPF moved steadily south through the eastern part of the country, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=288}} Their unit stationed in Kigali was isolated from the rest of their forces but a unit of young soldiers successfully crossed government-held territory to link up with them.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=288}} They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=299}} The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=299}}\n\nIn April there were numerous attempts by the United Nations forces to establish a cease-fire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=300}} In late April the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|pp=326\u2013327}} They encountered little resistance except around Kigali and Ruhengeri.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=268}} By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and [[Gitarama]], the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan Army forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north-west.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=410}} As well as fighting the war Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and Rwandan Tutsi refugees who had been living in Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=270}}\n\nIn late June 1994 France launched ''[[Op\u00e9ration Turquoise]]'', a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for [[displaced person]]s, [[refugee]]s, and civilians in danger.{{sfn|United Nations|1996}} From bases in the Zairian cities of [[Goma]] and [[Bukavu]], the French entered south-western Rwanda and established the ''Turquoise'' zone, within the [[Cyangugu]]\u2013Kibuye\u2013[[Gikongoro]] triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda.{{sfn|United Nations|1996}} Radio France International estimates that ''Turquoise'' saved around 15,000 lives,{{sfn|RFI|2014}} but with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF's ascendancy, many Rwandans interpreted ''Turquoise'' as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide.{{sfn|Fassbender|2011|p=27}} The French remained hostile to the RPF and their presence held up the RPF's advance in the south-west of the country.{{sfn|McGreal|2007}} ''Op\u00e9ration Turquoise'' remained in Rwanda until 21 August 1994.{{sfn|Rucyahana|2007|p=137}}\n\nHaving completed the encirclement of Kigali, the RPF spent the latter half of June fighting for the capital.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=421}} The Rwandan Army forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory and conducted raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=421}} According to Dallaire, this success was due to Kagame's being a \"master of psychological warfare\";{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=421}} he exploited the fact that the Rwandan Army were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali and exploited the government's loss of morale as it lost territory.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=421}} The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan Army in Kigali on 4 July{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=459}} and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north-west, forcing the interim government into Zaire.

rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) from 1 October 1990 to 18 July 1994. The war arose from the long-running dispute between the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] groups within the Rwandan population. A [[Rwandan Revolution|1959\u20131962 revolution]] had replaced the [[Kingdom of Rwanda|Tutsi monarchy]] with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in [[Uganda]] founded the RPF which, under the leadership of [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]], became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.\n\nThe war began on 1 October 1990 when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the [[Virunga Mountains]] for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]], which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by [[Hutu Power]], a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] in August 1993.\n\nAn uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a \"final solution\" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|assassination of President Habyarimana]] on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the [[Rwandan genocide]]. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, [[Kigali]], and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and ''genocidaires'' into [[Zaire]].\n\nThe victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as de facto leader. Kagame served as [[Vice President of Rwanda|vice president]] from 1994 and as president from 2000. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the [[First Congo War]], which removed long-time dictator President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Pre-independence Rwanda and origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa===\n{{main|Origins of Hutu, Tutsi and Twa}}\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of the [[King of Rwanda]]'s palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]]|alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof]]\nThe earliest inhabitants of what is now [[Rwanda]] were the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], and the [[Tutsi]] migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the [[Horn of Africa]].{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=12}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial,  distinction.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|2004|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nThe population coalesced, first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] (''ubwoko''){{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} expanding through conquest and assimilation.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=38}} It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]] in 1853\u20131895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} {{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} These included ''uburetwa'', a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them,{{sfn|Pottier|2002|p=13}} and ''[[ubuhake]]'', under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=13\u201314}} Rwanda and neighbouring [[Burundi]] were assigned to Germany by the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference]] of 1884,{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=218}} and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=24}} German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=25}} The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior.{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=17}} The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=217\u2013218}} [[East African Campaign (World War I)|Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi]] during World War I,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25\u201326}} and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=26}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=32\u201335}} They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=35}} Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=38\u201339}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n===Revolution, exile of Tutsi, and the Hutu republic===\n{{main|Rwandan Revolution}}\nAfter 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=108}} demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=45\u201346}} The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=43}}{{sfn|Kroslak|2007|p=24}} There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=43\u201344}} with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were [[Flemish people|Flemish]] rather than [[Walloons|Walloon]] Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=113}} In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists.{{sfn|Carney|2013|pp=124\u2013125}} Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the [[Rwandan Revolution]].{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=125}} The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians,{{sfn|Newbury|1988|pp=195\u2013196}} but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel [[Guy Logiest]], who was brought in by the colonial Governor.{{sfn|Newbury|1988|p=196}} Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite.{{sfn|Carney|2013|p=127}} He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced [[Kigeli V of Rwanda|King Kigeli V]] into exile.{{sfn|Sabar|2013}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb| Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] (pictured) became President of Rwanda after [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a 1973 coup]].]]\nLogiest and Hutu leader [[Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda]] declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=53\u201354}} More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=62}}{{sfn|Mayersen|2010|p=21}} mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, [[Tanzania]] and Zaire.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|pp=160\u2013161}} Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=63\u201364}} and sought to return to Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=55}} the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}} These groups were known in [[Kinyarwanda]] as the ''inyenzi'' (cockroaches).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=54}} Historians do not know the origin of this term \u2013 it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=34}} The ''inyenzi'' attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=56}}\n\nKayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=57}} In 1973 Hutu army officer [[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]] toppled Kayibanda in [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} He founded the [[National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]] (MRND) party in 1975,{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=117}} and promulgated a new constitution following a [[Rwandan constitutional referendum, 1978|1978 referendum]], making the country a [[one-party state]] in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2007|p=116}} Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=74\u201376}} A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to [[foreign aid]] receipts.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=84}} The family of first lady [[Agathe Habyarimana]], known as the ''[[akazu]]'', were the principal winners in this fight.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=85}} The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near [[Gisenyi]] in the nineteenth century.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The ''akazu'' exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=86}} The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the [[national budget]], which led to civil unrest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=87\u201389}} On the advice of French president [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], Habyarimana declared a commitment to [[Multi-party system|multi-party politics]] but took no action to bring this about.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}} Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=90}}\n\n=== Formation of the RPF and preparation for war ===\nThe organisation which became the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President [[Milton Obote]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=67}} Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, [[Idi Amin]], including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin.{{sfn|Dash|1983}} Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees [[Fred Rwigyema]] and [[Paul Kagame]] had joined [[Yoweri Museveni]]'s rebel [[Front for National Salvation]] (FRONASA).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=68}} Museveni [[Uganda\u2013Tanzania War|fought alongside Obote]] to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the [[Ugandan general election, 1980|1980 general election]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the [[National Resistance Army]] (NRA).{{sfn|Associated Press (I)|1981}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}} The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the [[Ugandan Bush War]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=39}}{{sfn|Nganda|2009}} President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to [[Nairobi]] in Kenya.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=63}} In 1982, with the authority of Obote,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} local district councils in the [[Ankole]] region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=19}} These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=69}} Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} Faced with the threat of statelessness,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=22}} many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=24}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=70}}\n[[File:ReaganMuseveni.jpg|thumb|Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] meeting with [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in October 1987]]\nIn 1986 the NRA [[Battle of Kampala|captured Kampala]] with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=47}} After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=50\u201351}}{{sfn|Simpson (I)|2000}} The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=51\u201352}} With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala.{{sfn|Wells|Fellows|2016|p=29}} At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=72\u201373}} In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing [[Peter Bayingana]] as RPF president.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice presidency.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana remained as the other vice president but resented the loss of the leadership.{{sfn|Bamurangirwa|2013|p=80}} Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=31}}\n\nRwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} At the same time many native Ugandans and [[Baganda]] officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=33}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=175}} He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=53}} They remained de facto senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=34}} caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=53\u201354}} In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans,{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=176}} led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labeling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=182}} Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=57}} It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=97\u201398}} In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the [[Command and General Staff College]] in [[Fort Leavenworth]] in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=61}} After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=61\u201362}} Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=62}}\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== 1990 invasion and death of Rwigyema ===\nOn 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan national army]] and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including [[machine gun]]s, [[autocannon]]s, [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]], and Soviet [[BM-21 Grad|BM-21 multiple rocket launchers]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=93}} accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=65}} Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in [[New York City]] attending the United Nations [[World Summit for Children]].{{sfn|Biles|1990}} In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} south to [[Gabiro]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} Their [[Rwandan Armed Forces]] opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}} The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=94}}\n\nOn 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government,{{sfn|Government of Rwanda|2009}} and the version mentioned by historian [[G\u00e9rard Prunier]] in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=95\u201396}} In his 2009 book ''Africa's World War'', Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander [[Chris Bunyenyezi]] wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=13\u201314}} Another senior RPF officer, [[Stephen Nduguta]], witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother [[Salim Saleh]] to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana's and Bunyenyezi's arrests and eventual executions.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=14}}\n\nWhen news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French president's son, [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand]], was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger.{{refn|group=note|Many sources report that the attack was staged:{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua also finds that the most convincing explanation, but writes that it remains open to debate.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}}}} As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|pp=24\u201325}} The French operation was code-named [[Op\u00e9ration Noro\u00eet|Noro\u00eet]] and its official purpose was to protect French nationals.{{sfn|Wallis|2006|p=27}} In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and [[Kigali International Airport]].{{sfn|Melvern|2000|p=14}} Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=107}} Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=107\u2013108}} Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=88}} Zairian President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite [[Special Presidential Division]] (DSP).{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=101}} but their discipline was poor.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=109}} prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=78}} With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the [[Akagera National Park]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}} Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a \"rear command\" for the group in Kampala, and \"flagging off\" the invasion.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=116}} The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=96}}\n\nThe Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=34}} Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; [[Radio Rwanda]] aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in [[Gisenyi Province]], killing 383 Tutsi.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=16}} It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated,{{sfn|Longman|2017|p=126}} as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia Britannica}}\n\n=== Kagame's reorganisation of the RPF ===\n[[File:RwandaVolcanoAndLake cropped2.jpg|thumb|The [[Virunga Mountains]], the RPF base from 1990 to 1991|alt=Photograph of a lake with one of the Virunga Mountains behind, partially in cloud]]\nPaul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=63}} At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=64}} When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=67}} He flew through [[London]] and [[Addis Ababa]] to [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]], where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service;{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=75\u201376}} the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}}\n\nThe RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=76}} Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=78\u201379}} He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the [[Virunga mountains]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=79}} Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=114\u2013115}} The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}\n\nMeanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a [[Decoy#Military decoy|decoy]] to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}} The reorientation towards [[guerrilla warfare]] began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from [[Katuna]].{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=112\u2013113}} Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=114}} The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nConditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost {{convert|5000|m|ft}},{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the [[Alpine climate|high-altitude cold climate]].{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=80}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} [[Alexis Kanyarengwe]], a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Another Hutu, [[Seth Sendashonga]], became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=116}} Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}} The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=83}}\n\nThe RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner [[Aloisia Inyumba]] in Kampala.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=115}} They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=82}} as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=117}} The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=118}} It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to G\u00e9rard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Museveni later said that \"faced with [a] ''fait accompli'' situation by our Rwandan brothers\", Uganda went \"to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability\".{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=183}} Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal \"nearly got depleted\"; he suspected that the war \"must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget\", costing the country \"trillions of shillings\".{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|pp=117, 121}}\n\n=== Attack on Ruhengeri, January 1991 ===\n[[File:Ruhengeri.jpg|thumb|The town of [[Ruhengeri]], with the [[Virunga Mountains]] in the background|alt=Photograph of Ruhengeri, Rwanda, with buildings, a street, and people visible, and mountains in the background, partially in cloud]]\nAfter three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} The target for the first attack was the northern city of [[Ruhengeri]],{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=87}} south of the Virunga mountains.{{sfn|ITMB Publishing}} The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}}\n\nDuring the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} They attacked on the morning of 23 January.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Most of the civilian population fled.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}}\n\nOne of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} When he learnt of the invasion the warden, {{interlanguage link|Charles Uwihoreye|fr}}, telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=120}} He spoke to Colonel [[Elie Sagatwa]], one of the ''akazu'', who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}} Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=88}} Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including [[Th\u00e9oneste Lizinde]], a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=119}}\n\nThe RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda.{{sfn|Muhanguzi Kampe|2016|p=127}} The government sent troops to the city the following day and a [[state of emergency]] was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}} The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=89}}\n\n=== Guerrilla war, 1991\u20131992 ===\nFollowing the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=90}} Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=91}} The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of [[Gatuna]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of [[Mombasa]] via the [[Northern Corridor]], forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier [[Central Corridor (Africa)|Central Corridor]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=135}} By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near [[Mulindi]], Byumba province.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=96}} Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of [[internally displaced persons]] in the country.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=136}}\n\nThe renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30\u201360 [[Bagogwe]] Tutsi pastoralists near [[Kinigi]] and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=136\u2013137}} The ''akazu'' also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}} This included the [[Hutu Ten Commandments]], a set of \"rules\" published in the ''[[Kangura]]'' magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=92\u201394}} In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, [[Radio Muhabura]], which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno1-3-10.htm Propaganda and Practice]}}\n\nThe second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the [[Republican Democratic Movement]] (MDR), [[Social Democratic Party (Rwanda)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD) and the [[Liberal Party (Rwanda)|Liberal Party]] (PL),{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=123\u2013124}} but the one-party state law had remained in place.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=66\u221267}} Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=127}} The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the [[Coalition for the Defence of the Republic]] (CDR),{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=69}} which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the ''akazu''.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=98}}\n\nProgress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=134}} Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=103}} and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=145}} The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of [[Arusha]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=150}}\n\n===Peace process, 1992\u20131993===\nThe peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the \"democratic\" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=151}} The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=97}} Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=161}} Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; ''akazu'' affiliates [[Augustin Ndindiliyimana]] and [[Th\u00e9oneste Bagosora]] remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=167}}\n\nThe delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} In August the parties agreed a \"pluralistic transitional government\", which would include the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=163}} they began killing Tutsi civilians in the [[Kibuye, Rwanda|Kibuye]] area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=162}} Historian G\u00e9rard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal \"final solution\" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=169}} Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=170}}\n\nThe situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=140\u2212141}} This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} MRND national secretary [[Mathieu Ngirumpatse]] announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=173}} The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\n===RPF offensive, February 1993===\n[[File:RwandaTerritoryAfterFeb1993.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The partition of Rwanda following the RPF offensive in February 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=xx}} For the first time, the Rwandan Government acknowledged that it had lost part of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}}|alt=Map showing the partition of Rwanda between government, RPF, and demilitarised zones.]]\nPaul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=80}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar [[Bruce D.

By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}}\n\nThe RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991\u20131992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the [[Rwandan franc]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=159}} had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}} The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready,{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=20}} with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=174}}\n\nThe RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} and later the city of [[Byumba]]. Local Hutu civilians fled ''en masse'' from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali.{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to Andr\u00e9 Guichaoua several thousand were killed,{{sfn|Guichaoua|2015|p=81}} while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as \"small-scale\".{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}}\n\nWhen it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda,{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=176}} A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|p=141}} The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\nBy 20 February the RPF had advanced to within {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} of the capital, [[Kigali]],{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=175}} The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=177}} Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} Kagame told journalist and author [[Stephen Kinzer]] that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=104}} The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}} By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=105}}\n\n===Arusha Accords and rise of Hutu Power, 1993\u20131994===\n{{main|Arusha Accords (Rwanda)}}\n[[File:AICC Arusha.jpg|thumb|The [[Arusha International Conference Centre]], venue for peace talks to end the war|alt=Photograph showing the front entrance of the Arusha International Conference Centre]]\nThe RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital [[Kampala]], attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=106}} Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=107}}\n\nDespite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=178}} spent the subsequent months forging a \"common front\" against the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=179}} The hardline factions within the parties became known as [[Hutu Power]], a movement which transcended party politics.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=188}} Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Instead almost every party was split into \"moderate\" and \"Power\" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=181\u2013182}} Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=182}} Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the ''[[Interahamwe]]'', which was attached to the ruling party,{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=129}} and the CDR's ''[[Impuzamugambi]]''.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}} The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country.{{sfn|Melvern|2004|p=25}} The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=165}}\n\nBy June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=186}} The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks.{{sfn|Adelman|Suhrke|1999|pp=142\u2013143}} The government eventually agreed to their demands.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=193}} The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army.{{sfn|IPEP|2000|pp=49\u201350}} With all details agreed the [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=191}}\n\nAn uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations [[peacekeeping]] force; this was titled the [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda]] (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=98}} under the command of Canadian General [[Rom\u00e9o Dallaire]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=42}} Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the ''Conseil national de d\u00e9veloppement'' (CND), now known as the [[Chamber of Deputies (Rwanda)|Chamber of Deputies]], Rwanda's Parliament building.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} These men were protected by 600\u20131,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's [[Operation Clean Corridor]] in December 1993.{{sfn|Dallaire|2003|p=130}} Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The President of Burundi, [[Melchior Ndadaye]], who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, [[1993 Burundian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|was assassinated]] by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=199}} The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} The idea of a \"final solution\", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=200}} An informant from the ''Interahamwe'' told UNAMIR officials that a group of Hutu extremists were planning on disrupting the peace process and killing Tutsis in Kigali.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Greg Barker (Director)| title = Ghosts of Rwanda| medium = Television production| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service]]| date = 1 April 2004| url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/ghosts/}}</ref>\n\n===Military operations during the 1994 genocide===\n{{main|Rwandan genocide}}\n[[File:RPF advance Rwandan Genocide cropped 1994.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994.{{sfn|Kuperman|2001|p=41}}|alt=Map showing the advance of the RPF during the Rwandan genocide of 1994]]\nThe cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was shot down]] near [[Kigali Airport]], killing both Habyarimana and the new [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President of Burundi]], [[Cyprien Ntaryamira]].{{sfn|National Assembly of France|1998}}{{sfn|BBC News (I)|2010}} The pair were returning home from a regional summit in [[Dar es Salaam]] at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=211}} The attackers remain unknown.

Many buildings were uninhabitable and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=181}} Human resources were severely depleted, with over {{Percentage|40|100|0}} of the population having fled or been killed.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=181}} Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|2011}} The long-term effects of [[Rape during the Rwandan genocide|war rape]] included social isolation, [[sexually transmitted diseases]] and unwanted pregnancies and babies, some women resorting to [[self-induced abortion]]s.{{sfn|de Brouwer|2005|p=14}} The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's institutions and infrastructure.{{sfn|Bonner|1994}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=187}}\n\n[[Non-governmental organisation]]s began to move back into the country but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime. Most [[Aid|international aid]] was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=327\u2013328}} Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Bonner|1994}}\n\nDuring the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=189}} Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda, who had lost family or friends and sought revenge.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=189}} The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. [[Human Rights Watch]], as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=360}} and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings.{{sfn|Des Forges|1999|loc=[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-03.htm The Rwandan Patriotic Front]}} In an interview with Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=191}} The killings gained international attention after the 1995 [[Kibeho massacre]], in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in [[Butare Province]].{{sfn|Lorch|1995}} Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed;{{sfn|Australian War Memorial}} the Rwandan Government claimed that the death toll was 338.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=42}}\n\nPaul Kagame took over the presidency from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000 and began a large-scale national development drive, launching [[Vision 2020 (Rwanda)|a programme]] to develop Rwanda as a [[middle income country]] by 2020.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2000}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=226\u2013227}} The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the [[human development index]], health care, and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged {{percentage|8|100}} per year,{{sfn|Murdock|2010}} the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011,{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012}} and [[life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000{{sfn|UNDP|2013|p=2}} to 64.3 years in 2018.{{sfn|CIA (I)}} A period of reconciliation began as well as the establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects. These included the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and ''[[Gacaca]]'', a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}}\n\n===Refugee crisis, insurgency, and Congo wars===\n{{main|Great Lakes refugee crisis|First Congo War|Second Congo War}}\n[[File:Rwandan refugee camp in east Zaire.jpg|thumb|[[Refugee camp]] in [[Zaire]], 1994|alt=View of refugee camp on foggy day, showing tents of various colours and the refugees]]\nFollowing the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=312}} The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]].{{sfn|UNHCR|2000}}{{sfn|Siddique|1994}} They were set up by the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=313\u2013314}} who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=381\u2013382}}{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}}\n\nBy late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive.{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=382}} Rwanda provided troops and military training{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} to the [[Banyamulenge]], a Tutsi group in the Zairian [[South Kivu]] province,{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=384\u2013385}} helping them to defeat Zairian security forces.

hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee;{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=118}} many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=122\u2013123}} The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of

cross-border insurgency campaign,{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=209}} supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces.{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|p=216}} By 1999 a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|national army]] succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.{{sfn|Brittain|1999}}{{sfn|Kinzer|2008|pp=215\u2013218}}\n\nAs well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu.{{sfn|Pomfret|1997}} Mobutu had supported the ''genocidaires'' based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire.{{sfn|Byman|Chalk|Hoffman|Rosenau|2001|p=18}} The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by [[Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila]], which began waging the [[First Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=113\u2013116}} The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=128\u2013133}} They controlled the whole country by May 1997.{{sfn|Prunier|2009|p=136}} Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the [[Second Congo War]].{{sfn|Prunier|2009|pp=182\u2013183}} This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage.{{sfn|BBC News (II)}} A 2010 United Nations report accused the [[Rwandan Patriotic Army]] of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two
