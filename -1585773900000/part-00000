The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of [[Kansas]], and nearly all of what are now the states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Wyoming]]. The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of [[Idaho]] and Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon Trail was laid by [[fur trade]]rs and trappers from about 1811 to 1840, and was only passable on foot or by horseback. By 1836, when the first migrant [[wagon train]] was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west, and eventually reached all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon, at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete, even as almost annual improvements were made in the form of bridges, cutoffs, ferries, and roads, which made the trip faster and safer. From various starting points in Iowa, Missouri, or [[Nebraska Territory]], the routes converged along the lower [[Platte River|Platte River Valley]] near [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory, and led to rich farmlands west of the [[Rocky Mountains]], a great site of masturbation.\n\nFrom the early to mid-1830s (and particularly through the years 1846\u20131869) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers, farmers, miners, ranchers, and business owners and their families. The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863), before turning off to their separate destinations. Use of the trail declined as the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869, making the trip west substantially faster, cheaper, and safer. Today, modern highways, such as [[Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 84 (Oregon\u2013Utah)|Interstate 84]], follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Oregon Trail}}\n\n=== Lewis and Clark Expedition ===\n{{Main|Lewis and Clark Expedition}}\n[[File:Carte Lewis-Clark Expedition-en.png|thumb|240px|Route of the Lewis and Clark expedition]]\nIn 1803, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] issued the following instructions to [[Meriwether Lewis]]: \"The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, & such principal stream of it, as, by its course & communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado and/or other river may offer the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce.\"<ref>{{cite book |author = Federal Writers Project |title = The Oregon Trail: The Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean |url = https://archive.org/stream/oregontrailthemi00fedemiss#page/215/mode/1up |series = American Guide Series |location = New York |publisher = Hastings House |via = Open Library |year = 1939 |page = 215 |accessdate = January 11, 2013 }}</ref> Although Lewis and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] found a path to the Pacific Ocean, it was not until 1859 that a direct and practicable route, the [[Mullan Road]], connected the Missouri River to the [[Columbia River]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Johnson |first = Randall A. |title = The Mullan Road: A Real Northwest Passage |publisher = History Ink |url = http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=9202 |format = Reprint of 1995 article in ''The Pacific Northwesterner'', Vol. 39, No. 2 |accessdate = January 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe first land route across what is now the United States was mapped by the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1804 and 1806. Lewis and Clark initially believed they had found a practical overland route to the west coast; however, the two passes they found going through the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Lemhi Pass]] and [[Lolo Pass (Idaho-Montana)|Lolo Pass]], turned out to be much too difficult for prairie schooner wagons to pass through without considerable road work. On the return trip in 1806, they traveled from the Columbia River to the [[Snake River]] and the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] over Lolo pass again. They then traveled overland up the [[Blackfoot River (Idaho)|Blackfoot River]] and crossed the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at Lewis and Clark Pass and on to the head of the Missouri River. This was ultimately a shorter and faster route than the one they followed west. This route had the disadvantages of being much too rough for wagons and controlled by the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] tribes. Even though Lewis and Clark had only traveled a narrow portion of the upper Missouri River drainage and part of the Columbia River drainage, these were considered the two major rivers draining most of the Rocky Mountains, and the expedition confirmed that there was no \"easy\" route through the northern Rocky Mountains as Jefferson had hoped. Nonetheless, this famous expedition had mapped both the eastern and western river valleys (Platte and Snake Rivers) that bookend the route of the Oregon Trail (and other [[emigrant trail]]s) across the continental divide{{mdash}}they just had not located the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] or some of the interconnecting valleys later used in the high country. They did show the way for the [[mountain men]], who within a decade would find a better way across, even if it was not to be an easy way.\n\n===Pacific Fur Company===\n{{Main|Pacific Fur Company}}\n\nFounded by [[John Jacob Astor]] as a subsidiary of his [[American Fur Company]] (AFC) in 1810, the [[Pacific Fur Company]] (PFC) operated in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the ongoing [[North American fur trade]]. Two movements of PFC employees were planned by Astor, one detachment to be sent to the Columbia River by the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' and the other overland under an expedition led by [[Wilson Price Hunt]]. Hunt and his party were to find possible supply routes and trapping territories for further [[fur trade|fur trading]] posts. Upon arriving at the river in March 1811, the ''Tonquin'' crew began construction of what became [[Fort Astoria]]. The ship left supplies and men to continue work on the station and ventured north up the coast to [[Clayoquot Sound]] for a trading expedition. While anchored there, [[Jonathan Thorn]] insulted an elder [[Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations|Tla-o-qui-aht]] who was previously elected by the natives to negotiate a mutually satisfactory price for animal pelts. Soon after, the vessel was attacked and overwhelmed by the indigenous Clayoquot, killing many of the crew. Its [[Quinault people|Quinault]] interpreter survived, and later told the PFC management at Fort Astoria of the destruction. The next day, the ship was blown up by surviving crew members.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/tonquin |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130606010101/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/tonquin |title = Tonquin |encyclopedia = The Canadian Encyclopedia |archive-date = June 6, 2013 |url-status = dead |accessdate = May 11, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&dq=tonquin+canadian+encyclopedia&q=tonquin#v=snippet&q=tonquin&f=false |title = The Canadian Encyclopedia |last = Marsh |first = James H. |date = 1999 |publisher = The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn = 9780771020995 |language = en }}</ref>\n[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|thumb|[[United States territorial acquisitions|U.S. territorial acquisitions]]{{endash}}portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.]]\nUnder Hunt, fearing attack by the [[Niitsitapi]], the overland expedition veered south of Lewis and Clark's route into what is now Wyoming and in the process passed across [[Union Pass]] and into [[Jackson Hole]], Wyoming. From there they went over the [[Teton Range]] via [[Teton Pass]] and then down to the Snake River into modern [[Idaho]]. They abandoned their horses at the Snake River, made dugout canoes, and attempted to use the river for transport. After a few days' travel they soon discovered that steep canyons, waterfalls and impassable rapids made travel by river impossible. Too far from their horses to retrieve them, they had to cache most of their goods and walk the rest of the way to the Columbia River where they made new boats and traveled to the newly established Fort Astoria. The expedition demonstrated that much of the route along the Snake River plain and across to the Columbia was passable by pack train or with minimal improvements, even wagons.<ref>{{cite web |title = Map of Astorian expedition, Lewis and Clark expedition, Oregon Trail, etc. in Pacific Northwest etc |url = http://www.oregon.com/history/oregon_trail_maps.cfm |publisher = oregon.com |accessdate = December 31, 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202113800/http://www.oregon.com/history/oregon_trail_maps.cfm |archivedate = February 2, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This knowledge would be incorporated into the concatenated trail segments as the Oregon Trail took its early shape.\n\nPacific Fur Company partner [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] led a small group of men back east to report to Astor. The group planned to retrace the path followed by the overland expedition back up to the east following the Columbia and Snake rivers.

The party continued east via the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]], [[North Platte River]] (where they spent the winter of 1812\u201313) and [[Platte River]] to the Missouri River, finally arriving in St. Louis in the spring of 1813.

Painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller]]\n\nIn August 1811, three months after Fort Astor was established, [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] and his team of British North West Company explorers came floating down the Columbia to Fort Astoria. He had just completed a journey through much of western Canada and most of the Columbia River drainage system. He was mapping the country for possible fur trading posts. Along the way he camped at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers and posted a notice claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort on the site ([[Fort Nez Perces]] was later established there). Astor, concerned the British navy would seize their forts and supplies in the War of 1812, sold to the North West Company in 1812 their forts, supplies and furs on the Columbia and Snake River. The North West Company started establishing more forts and trading posts of its own.\n\nBy 1821, when armed hostilities broke out with its [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) rivals, the North West Company was pressured by the British government to merge with the HBC. The HBC had nearly a complete monopoly on trading (and most governing issues) in the Columbia District, or Oregon Country as it was referred to by the Americans, and also in [[Rupert's Land]]. That year the British parliament passed a statute applying the laws of [[Upper Canada]] to the district and giving the HBC power to enforce those laws.\n\nFrom 1812 to 1840, the British, through the HBC, had nearly complete control of the Pacific Northwest and the western half of the Oregon Trail. In theory, the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the War of 1812, restored possession of Oregon territory to the United States. \"Joint occupation\" of the region was formally established by the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]]. The British, through the HBC, tried to discourage any U.S. trappers, traders and settlers from work or settlement in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Breaking up Camp at Sunrise - Walters 371940142.jpg|thumb|left|''Breaking up Camp at Sunrise'', by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\n\nBy overland travel, American missionaries and early settlers (initially mostly ex-trappers) started showing up in Oregon around 1824.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Although officially the HBC discouraged settlement because it interfered with its lucrative fur trade, its Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, [[John McLoughlin]], gave substantial help, including employment, until they could get established. In the early 1840s thousands of American settlers arrived and soon greatly outnumbered the British settlers in Oregon.<ref name=\"Mackie1997\">{{cite book |last = Mackie |first = Richard Somerset |title = Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific; 1793 - 1843 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VKXgJw6K088C&pg=PA318 |accessdate = May 11, 2013 |year = 1997 |publisher = UBC Press |isbn = 978-0-7748-0613-8 |page = 318 }}</ref> McLoughlin, despite working for the HBC, gave help in the form of loans, medical care, shelter, clothing, food, supplies and seed to U.S. emigrants. These new emigrants often arrived in Oregon tired, worn out, nearly penniless, with insufficient food or supplies, just as winter was coming on. McLoughlin would later be hailed as the Father of Oregon.\n\nThe [[York Factory Express]], establishing another route to the Oregon territory, evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the North West Company between Fort Astoria and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], Ontario on [[Lake Superior]]. By 1825 the HBC started using two brigades, each setting out from opposite ends of the express route\u2014one from [[Fort Vancouver]] on the Columbia River and the other from [[York Factory]] on Hudson Bay\u2014in spring and passing each other in the middle of the continent. This established a \"quick\"&mdash;about 100 days for {{convert|2600|mi|km}} one way&mdash;to resupply its forts and fur trading centers as well as collecting the furs the posts had bought and transmitting messages between Fort Vancouver and York Factory on Hudson Bay.[[File:York-Factory-Express.png|thumb|HBC's York Factory Express trade route, 1820s to 1840s. Modern political boundaries shown.]]\n\nThe HBC built a new much larger Fort Vancouver in 1824 slightly upstream of Fort Astoria on the north side of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada\u2013U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via [[Cape Horn]]) to drop off supplies and trade goods in its trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and from [[Russian Alaska]] into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.\n\nWhen American emigration over the Oregon Trail began in earnest in the early 1840s, for many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies, aid and help before starting their homesteads.<ref name=\"Mackie1997\"/> Fort Vancouver was the main re-supply point for nearly all Oregon trail travelers until U.S. towns could be established. The HBC established [[Fort Colvile]] in 1825 on the Columbia River near [[Kettle Falls]] as a good site to collect furs and control the upper Columbia River fur trade.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/FortColville.asp |title = Fort Colville |publisher = Nwcouncil.org |accessdate = March 19, 2011 }}</ref> [[Fort Nisqually]] was built near the present town of [[DuPont, Washington|DuPont]], Washington and was the first HBC fort on Puget Sound. [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] was erected in 1843 and became the headquarters of operations in British Columbia, eventually growing into modern-day [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the capital city of British Columbia.\n\n[[File:Oregoncountry.png|thumb|left|The Oregon Country/Columbia District stretched from 42'N to 54 40'N. The most heavily disputed portion is highlighted.]]\n\nBy 1840 the HBC had three forts: [[Fort Hall]] (purchased from [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]] in 1837), [[Fort Boise]] and [[Fort Nez Perce]] on the western end of the Oregon Trail route as well as Fort Vancouver near its terminus in the [[Willamette Valley]]. With minor exceptions they all gave substantial and often desperately needed aid to the early Oregon Trail pioneers.\n\nWhen the fur trade slowed in 1840 because of fashion changes in men's hats, the value of the Pacific Northwest to the British was seriously diminished. Canada had few potential settlers who were willing to move more than {{convert|2500|mi|km}} to the Pacific Northwest, although several hundred ex-trappers, British and American, and their families did start settling in Oregon, Washington and California. They used most of the York Express route through northern Canada. In 1841, [[James Sinclair (fur trapper)|James Sinclair]], on orders from Sir [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]], guided nearly 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] (located at the junction of the [[Assiniboine River]] and [[Red River of the North|Red River]] near present [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada) into the Oregon territory.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~orgenweb/furtrade.html Red River Settlers in Oregon], Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.newpghs.com/historical-maps |title = Area Histories: Historical Maps |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = North East Winnipeg Historical Society Inc.

The British lost the land north of the Columbia River they had so long controlled. The new [[Canada\u2013United States border]] was established much further north at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. The treaty granted the HBC navigation rights on the Columbia River for supplying their fur posts, clear titles to their trading post properties allowing them to be sold later if they wanted, and left the British with good anchorages at [[Vancouver]] and Victoria. It gave the United States what it mostly wanted, a \"reasonable\" boundary and a good anchorage on the West Coast in Puget Sound. While there were almost no United States settlers in the future state of Washington in 1846, the United States had already demonstrated it could induce thousands of settlers to go to the Oregon Territory, and it would be only a short time before they would vastly outnumber the few hundred HBC employees and retirees living in Washington.\n\n=== Great American Desert ===\n[[File:Trail ruts State Hist site Wyoming.jpg|thumb|[[Oregon Trail Ruts (Guernsey, Wyoming)|Trail ruts]] near Guernsey, Wyoming]]\n\nReports from expeditions in 1806 by Lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]] and in 1819 by Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Stephen Long]] described the [[Great Plains]] as \"unfit for human habitation\" and as \"The [[Great American Desert]]\". These descriptions were mainly based on the relative lack of timber and surface water. The images of sandy wastelands conjured up by terms like \"desert\" were tempered by the many reports of vast herds of millions of [[Plains Bison]] that somehow managed to live in this \"desert\".<ref>It was not until later that the [[Ogallala Aquifer]] was discovered and used for irrigation, dry farming techniques developed and railtracks laid.</ref> In the 1840s, the Great Plains appeared to be unattractive for settlement and were illegal for homesteading until well after 1846\u2014initially it was set aside by the U.S. government for Native American settlements. The next available land for general settlement, Oregon, appeared to be free for the taking and had fertile lands, disease free climate ([[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]] were then prevalent in much of the Missouri and [[Mississippi River]] drainage), extensive uncut, unclaimed forests, big rivers, potential seaports, and only a few nominally British settlers.\n\n=== Fur traders, trappers and explorers ===\nFur trappers, often working for fur traders, followed nearly all possible streams looking for beaver in the years (1812\u201340) the fur trade was active.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |title = IDAHO FUR TRADE |accessdate = April 16, 2009 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090416142248/http://www.history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |archivedate = April 16, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Fur traders included [[Manuel Lisa]], Robert Stuart, [[William Henry Ashley]], [[Jedediah Smith]], [[William Sublette]], [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]], [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]], [[Kit Carson]], [[Jim Bridger]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]], [[Alexander Ross (fur trader)|Alexander Ross]], [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], and other [[mountain man|mountain men]].

The fur trade business wound down to a very low level just as the Oregon trail traffic seriously began around 1840.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Our Camp - Walters 371940177.jpg|thumb|''Our Camp'', by Alfred Jacob Miller]]\n\nIn fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the [[Yellowstone River]] to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813\u2014eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Smith was killed by Comanche natives around 1831.\n\n[[File:JedediahSmithEnglishVersion.png|thumb|left|The exploration of the West by [[Jedediah Smith]]]]\n\nUp to 3,000 mountain men were [[animal trapping|trappers]] and [[Exploration|explorers]], employed by various British and United States fur companies or working as free trappers, who roamed the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 to the early 1840s. They usually traveled in small groups for mutual support and protection. Trapping took place in the fall when the fur became prime. Mountain men primarily trapped [[beaver]] and sold the skins. A good beaver skin could bring up to $4 at a time when a man's wage was often $1 per day. Some were more interested in exploring the West. In 1825, the first significant American [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] occurred on the Henry's Fork of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. The trading supplies were brought in by a large party using pack trains originating on the Missouri River. These pack trains were then used to haul out the fur bales. They normally used the north side of the Platte River\u2014the same route used 20 years later by the [[Mormon Trail]]. For the next 15 years the American rendezvous was an annual event moving to different locations, usually somewhere on the Green River in the future state of [[Wyoming]]. Each rendezvous, occurring during the slack summer period, allowed the fur traders to trade for and collect the furs from the trappers and their Native American allies without having the expense of building or maintaining a fort or wintering over in the cold Rockies. In only a few weeks at a rendezvous a year's worth of trading and celebrating would take place as the traders took their furs and remaining supplies back east for the winter and the trappers faced another fall and winter with new supplies. Trapper [[Jim Beckwourth]] described the scene as one of \"Mirth, songs, dancing, shouting, trading, running, jumping, singing, racing, target-shooting, yarns, frolic, with all sorts of extravagances that white men or Indians could invent.\"<ref>Gowans, Fred R. ''Rocky Mountain Rendezvous'', pg 27. Gibbs Smith Publisher. {{ISBN|1-58685-756-8}}</ref> In 1830, William Sublette brought the first wagons carrying his trading goods up the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers before crossing over South Pass to a fur trade rendezvous on the Green River near the future town of [[Big Piney, Wyoming|Big Piney]], Wyoming. He had a crew that dug out the gullies and river crossings and cleared the brush where needed. This established that the eastern part of most of the Oregon Trail was passable by wagons. In the late 1830s the HBC instituted a policy intended to destroy or weaken the American fur trade companies. The HBC's annual collection and re-supply Snake River Expedition was transformed to a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to undersell the American traders\u2014losing money but undercutting the American fur traders. By 1840 the fashion in Europe and Britain shifted away from the formerly very popular beaver felt hats and prices for furs rapidly declined and the trapping almost ceased.\n\n[[File:Greenutrivermap.png|thumb|Map of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] watershed]]\n\nFur traders tried to use the Platte River, the main route of the eastern Oregon Trail, for transport but soon gave up in frustration as its many channels and islands combined with its muddy waters were too shallow, crooked and unpredictable to use for water transport. The Platte proved to be unnavigable. The Platte River and North Platte River Valley, however, became an easy roadway for wagons, with its nearly flat plain sloping easily up and heading almost due west.\n\nThere were several U.S. government-sponsored explorers who explored part of the Oregon Trail and wrote extensively about their explorations. Captain [[Benjamin Bonneville]] on his expedition of 1832 to 1834 explored much of the Oregon trail and brought wagons up the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater route across South Pass to the Green River in Wyoming. He explored most of Idaho and the Oregon Trail to the Columbia. The account of his explorations in the west was published by [[Washington Irving]] in 1838.<ref>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville [[s:The Adventures of Captain Bonneville]]</ref> [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] of the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and his guide Kit Carson led three expeditions from 1842 to 1846 over parts of California and Oregon. His explorations were written up by him and his wife [[Jessie Benton Fr\u00e9mont]] and were widely published. The first detailed map of California and Oregon were drawn by Fr\u00e9mont and his [[Topography as the study of place|topographer]]s and [[Cartography|cartographers]] in about 1848.<ref>[http://www.davidrumsey.com/maps5489.html Fr\u00e9mont's Map of California and Oregon], Retrieved December 23, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Missionaries ===\nIn 1834, The Dalles [[Methodist Mission]] was founded by Reverend [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] just east of [[Mount Hood]] on the Columbia River. In 1836, [[Henry H. Spalding]] and [[Marcus Whitman]] traveled west to establish the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] near modern-day [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], Washington.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=1BD1D5D9-CBEA-5E8B-C0609C63D5C881B1 |title = Protestant Ladder |website = Oregon Historical Society |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614055025/http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=1BD1D5D9-CBEA-5E8B-C0609C63D5C881B1 |archive-date = June 14, 2012 |url-status = }}</ref> The party included the wives of the two men, [[Narcissa Whitman]] and [[Eliza Hart Spalding]], who became the first European-American women to cross the Rocky Mountains. En route, the party accompanied American fur traders going to the 1836 rendezvous on the Green River in Wyoming and then joined Hudson's Bay Company fur traders traveling west to Fort Nez Perce (also called [[Fort Walla Walla]]). The group was the first to travel in wagons all the way to Fort Hall, where the wagons were abandoned at the urging of their guides. They used pack animals for the rest of the trip to Fort Walla Walla and then floated by boat to Fort Vancouver to get supplies before returning to start their missions. Other missionaries, mostly husband and wife teams using wagon and pack trains, established missions in the Willamette Valley, as well as various locations in the future states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\n=== Early emigrants ===\nOn May 1, 1839, a group of eighteen men from [[Peoria, Illinois]], set out with the intention of colonizing the Oregon country on behalf of the United States of America and drive out the HBC operating there. The men of the [[Peoria Party]] were among the first pioneers to traverse most of the Oregon Trail. The men were initially led by [[Thomas J. Farnham]] and called themselves the [[Oregon Dragoons]]. They carried a large flag emblazoned with their motto \"''Oregon Or The Grave''\". Although the group split up near [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]] on the [[South Platte]] and Farnham was deposed as leader, nine of their members eventually did reach Oregon.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonpioneers.com/1839.htm |title = Oregon Emigrants 1839 |publisher = Oregonpioneers.com |date =  |accessdate = May 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1840, [[Robert Newell (politician)|Robert Newell]], [[Joseph L.

Their wagons were the first to reach the Columbia River over land, and they opened the final leg of Oregon Trail to wagon traffic.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.historylink.org/File/5235 |title = Robert Newell and Joseph Meek reach Fort Walla Walla |last = Oldham |first = Kit |date = 2003 |website = www.historylink.org |access-date = October 12, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1841, the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] was the first emigrant group credited with using the Oregon Trail to emigrate west. The group set out for California, but about half the party left the original group at [[Soda Springs, Idaho|Soda Springs]], Idaho, and proceeded to the Willamette Valley in Oregon, leaving their wagons at Fort Hall.\n\nOn May 16, 1842, the second organized wagon train set out from Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers.<ref>Members of the party later disagreed over the size of the party, one stating 160 adults and children were in the party, while another counted 105.</ref> The party was led by [[Elijah White]]. The group broke up after passing Fort Hall with most of the single men hurrying ahead and the families following later.\n\n=== Great Migration of 1843 ===\n[[File:ColumbiaAmericasGreatHighway040.png|thumb|A wagon converted to a raft for the last stage of the emigration.]]\n\nIn what was dubbed \"The Great Migration of 1843\" or the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |title = The Wagon Train of 1843: The Great Migration |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531061021/http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |archive-date = May 31, 2008 |url-status =  |access-date = December 22, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1840_1850.htm Events in The West: 1840\u20131850] PBS. Retrieved December 22, 2007.</ref> They were led initially by [[John Gantt]], a former U.S. Army Captain and fur trader who was contracted to guide the train to Fort Hall for $1 per person. The winter before, Marcus Whitman had made a brutal mid-winter trip from Oregon to St. Louis to appeal a decision by his mission backers to abandon several of the Oregon missions. He joined the wagon train at the Platte River for the return trip. When the pioneers were told at Fort Hall by agents from the Hudson's Bay Company that they should abandon their wagons there and use pack animals the rest of the way, Whitman disagreed and volunteered to lead the wagons to Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons. The biggest obstacle they faced was in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] of Oregon where they had to cut and clear a trail through heavy timber. The wagons were stopped at [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], Oregon, by the lack of a road around Mount Hood. The wagons had to be disassembled and floated down the treacherous Columbia River and the animals herded over the rough [[Lolo Pass (Oregon)|Lolo trail]] to get by Mt. Hood. Nearly all of the settlers in the 1843 wagon trains arrived in the Willamette Valley by early October. A passable wagon trail now existed from the Missouri River to The Dalles. Jesse Applegate's account of the emigration, \"[[A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]],\" has been described as \"the best bit of literature left to us by any participant in the [Oregon] pioneer movement...\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reviews|work=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=34|number=4|year=1935}}</ref> and has been republished several times from 1868 to 1990.<ref>{{cite journal |title=[[wikisource:en:Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843|Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]] |work=The Oregon Historical Quarterly |year=1900 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but completely passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about {{convert|2000|mi|km}}.\n\n=== Oregon Country ===\nIn 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley drafted the [[Organic Laws of Oregon]] organizing land claims within the Oregon Country. Married couples were granted at no cost (except for the requirement to work and improve the land) up to {{convert|640|acre|km2}} (a [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] or square mile), and unmarried settlers could claim {{convert|320|acre|km2}}. As the group was a provisional government with no authority, these claims were not valid under United States or British law, but they were eventually honored by the United States in the [[Donation Land Act]] of 1850. The Donation Land Act provided for married settlers to be granted {{convert|320|acre|km2}} and unmarried settlers {{convert|160|acre|km2}}. Following the expiration of the act in 1854 the land was no longer free but cost $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare) with a limit of {{convert|320|acre|km2}}\u2014the same as most other unimproved government land.\n\n=== Women on the Overland Trail ===\nConsensus interpretations, as found in John Faragher's book, ''Women and Men on the Overland Trail'' (1979), held that men and women's power within marriage was uneven. This meant that women did not experience the trail as liberating, but instead only found harder work than they had handled back east. However, feminist scholarship, by historians such as Lillian Schlissel,<ref>Lillian Schlissel, \"Women's diaries on the western frontier.\" ''American Studies'' (1977): 87-100 [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2301/2260 online].</ref> Sandra Myres,<ref>Sandra L.

Whereas men might deem the dangers of the trail acceptable if there was a strong economic reward at the end, women viewed those dangers as threatening to the stability and survival of the family. Once they arrived at their new western home, women's public role in building western communities and participating in the western economy gave them a greater authority than they had known back East. There was a \"female frontier\" that was distinct and different from that experienced by men.<ref>Kenneth L. Holmes, ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, Introduction by Anne M. Butler, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, (1983) pp 1-10.</ref>\n\nWomen's diaries kept during their travels or the letters they wrote home once they arrived at their destination supports these contentions. Women wrote with sadness and concern of the numerous deaths along the trail. Anna Maria King wrote to her family in 1845 about her trip to the [[Luckiamute River|Luckiamute Valley]] Oregon and of the multiple deaths experienced by her traveling group:\n\n<blockquote>But listen to the deaths: Sally Chambers, John King and his wife, their little daughter Electa and their babe, a son 9 months old, and Dulancy C. Norton's sister are gone. Mr. A. Fuller lost his wife and daughter Tabitha. Eight of our two families have gone to their long home.<ref>From the letter of Anna Maria King, in Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 41.</ref></blockquote>\n \nSimilarly, emigrant [[Martha Gay Masterson]], who traveled the trail with her family at the age of 13, mentioned the fascination she and other children felt for the graves and loose skulls they would find near their camps.<ref>Peavy, Linda S., and Ursula Smith. ''Pioneer Women: The Lives of Women on the Frontier''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, p. 40.</ref>\n \nAnna Maria King, like many other women, also advised family and friends back home of the realities of the trip and offered advice on how to prepare for the trip. Women also reacted and responded, often enthusiastically, to the landscape of the West. Betsey Bayley in a letter to her sister, Lucy P. Griffith described how travelers responded to the new environment they encountered:\n\n<blockquote>The mountains looked like volcanoes and the appearance that one day there had been an awful thundering of volcanoes and a burning world. The valleys were all covered with a white crust and looked like [[salaratus]]. Some of the company used it to raise their bread.<ref>From the letter of Betsey Bayley, in ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 35.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Mormon emigration ===\n{{Main|Mormon Trail}}\n\nFollowing persecution and mob action in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and other states, and the assassination of their prophet [[Joseph Smith]] in 1844, [[Mormon]] leader [[Brigham Young]] was chosen by the leaders of the [[Latter Day Saints]] (LDS) church to lead the Mormon settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]] encampments near [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in [[Iowa]] including [[Council Bluffs]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title = Mormons in Iowa towns |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archive-date = July 19, 2011 |url-status =  |access-date = January 5, 2009 }}</ref> About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from [[Mississippi]], Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in [[Nebraska]] to [[Fort Laramie]] in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with no one left behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants. Typically taking about 100 days to cover the {{convert|1000|mi|km}} trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about {{convert|15|mi|km}} per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to [[Fort Bridger]], where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as [[Hastings Cutoff]], used by the ill-fated [[Donner Party]] in 1846.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1860, over 43,000 Mormon settlers and tens of thousands of travelers on the [[California Trail]] and Oregon Trail followed Young to Utah. After 1848, the travelers headed to California or Oregon resupplied at the Salt Lake Valley, and then went back over the [[Salt Lake Cutoff]], rejoining the trail near the future Idaho&ndash;Utah border at the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] in Idaho.\n\nStarting in 1855, many of the poorer Mormon travelers made the trek with hand built [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcart]]s and fewer wagons. Guided by experienced guides, handcarts\u2014pulled and pushed by two to four people\u2014were as fast as ox-drawn wagons and allowed them to bring {{convert|75|to|100|lb|kg}} of possessions plus some food, bedding, and tents to Utah. Accompanying wagons carried more food and supplies. Upon arrival in Utah, the handcart pioneers were given or found jobs and accommodations by individual Mormon families for the winter until they could become established. About 3,000 out of over 60,000 [[Mormon pioneers]] came across with handcarts.\n\nAlong the Mormon Trail, the Mormon pioneers established a number of ferries and made trail improvements to help later travelers and earn much needed money. One of the better known ferries was the Mormon Ferry across the North Platte near the future site of [[Fort Caspar]] in Wyoming which operated between 1848 and 1852 and the [[Green River, Utah|Green River]] ferry near Fort Bridger which operated from 1847 to 1856. The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll of from $3 to $8.\n\n=== California Gold Rush ===\n{{Main|California Trail}}\n\nIn January 1848, James Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada portion of the [[American River]], sparking the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Peters |first = Arthur K. |title = Seven trail west |publisher = Abbeville Press |year = 1996 |isbn = 978-1-55859-782-2 |url = https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete |url-access = registration |page = [https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete/page/109 109] |ref = harv }}</ref> It is estimated that about two-thirds of the male population in Oregon went to California in 1848 to cash in on the opportunity. To get there, they helped build the Lassen Branch of the Applegate-Lassen Trail by cutting a wagon road through extensive forests. Many returned with significant gold which helped jump-start the Oregon economy. Over the next decade, gold seekers from the [[Midwest|Midwestern United States]] and [[East Coast of the United States]] dramatically increased traffic on the Oregon and California Trails. The \"forty-niners\" often chose speed over safety and opted to use shortcuts such as the [[Sublette Cutoff|Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff]] in Wyoming which reduced travel time by almost seven days but spanned nearly {{convert|45|mi|km}} of desert without water, grass, or fuel for fires.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |title = American West - Oregon Trail |website = American West |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205115352/http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |archive-date = December 5, 2010 |url-status = }}</ref> 1849 was the first year of large scale [[cholera]] epidemics in the United States, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California\u2014most buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska.

After 1849, the California Gold Rush continued for several years as the miners continued to find about $50,000,000 worth of gold per year at $21 per ounce.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/greeley/railroad_to_pacific.html |title = An Overland Journey from New York to San Francisco in the Summer of 1859 |last = Greeley |first = Horace |date =  |website = www.yosemite.ca.us |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref> Once California was established as a prosperous state, many thousands more emigrated there each year for the opportunities.\n\n=== Later emigration and uses of the trail ===\nThe trail was still in use during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but traffic declined after 1855 when the [[Panama Railroad]] across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] was completed. Paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships, often heavily subsidized to carry the mail, provided rapid transport to and from the east coast and [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, to and from [[Panama]] to ports in California and Oregon.\n\nOver the years many ferries were established to help get across the many rivers on the path of the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, [[Kansas River]], [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]], [[Elkhorn River]], [[Loup River]], Platte River, [[South Platte River]], North Platte River, [[Laramie River]], Green River, [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]], two crossings of the Snake River, [[John Day River]], [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30 per wagon but increased the speed of the transit from about 160 to 170 days in 1843 to 120 to 140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent death by drowning at river crossings.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 410|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1859, an expedition of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers]] led by Captain [[James H.

Upon return in early August, Simpson reported that he had surveyed the [[Central Overland Route]] from [[Camp Floyd]] to [[Genoa, Nevada]]. This route went through central Nevada (roughly where [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|U.S. Route 50]] goes today) and was about {{convert|280|mi|km}} shorter than the \"standard\" [[Humboldt River]] [[California trail]] route.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Simpson |first = Capt.

[[George Chorpenning]] immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line along with their stations from the \"Northern Route\" (California Trail) along the Humboldt River. In 1861, the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] also laid its lines alongside the Central Overland Route. Several stage lines were set up carrying mail and passengers that traversed much of the route of the original Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger and from there over the Central Overland Route to California. By traveling day and night with many stations and changes of teams (and extensive mail subsidies), these stages could get passengers and mail from the midwest to California in about 25 to 28 days. These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Oregon Trail and Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the First Transcontinental Telegraph stations and telegraph line, which followed much the same route in 1861 from [[Carson City, Nevada]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. The Pony Express folded in 1861 as they failed to receive an expected mail contract from the U.S. government and the telegraph filled the need for rapid east&ndash;west communication. This combination wagon/stagecoach/pony express/telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref name=\"Pony Express\"/> From Salt Lake City the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon/California/Oregon trails to Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n[[File:Oregon Trail pic.jpg|thumb|left|Covered wagon replica and Mission Monument at the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site]] about ten miles west of Walla Walla, Washington]]\n\nAfter the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, telegraph lines usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and telegraph lines were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. Telegraph lines to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned.\n\nAs the years passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used corridor from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots of the trail continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 the population in the states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences.\n\nEven before the famous Texas [[cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] after the Civil War, the trail was being used to drive herds of thousands of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hM2_IXMY3jQC&vq |title = The Plains Across the Overland Emigrants and Trans-Mississippi West 1840\u20131860 |last = Unruh |first = John D |publisher = University of Illinois Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-252-06360-2 |location =  |pages = 392, 512 |ref = harv }}</ref> In 1852, there were even records of a 1,500-turkey drive from Illinois to California.<ref>Barry, Louise. ''The Beginnings of the West''. 1972. pp 1084\u201385</ref> The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the midwest and at the end of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the midwest for about 1/3 to 1/10 what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the trail large herds of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets.\n\n=== Trail decline ===\nThe first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, providing faster, safer, and usually cheaper travel east and west (the journey took seven days and cost as little as $65, or $1189.39 in 2016 dollars).<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |title = Railroad ticket 1870 Transcontinental Railroad Statistics |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624020241/http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |archive-date = June 24, 2009 |url-status =  |access-date = January 21, 2009 }}</ref> Some emigrants continued to use the trail well into the 1890s, and modern highways and railroads eventually paralleled large portions of the trail, including [[U.S. Highway 26]], [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] in Oregon and Idaho and [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska. Contemporary interest in the overland trek has prompted the states and federal government to preserve landmarks on the trail including wagon ruts, buildings, and \"registers\" where emigrants carved their names. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a number of re-enactments of the trek with participants wearing period garments and traveling by wagon.\n\n== Routes ==\n[[File:South pass marker2.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trail pioneer [[Ezra Meeker]] erected this boulder near [[Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming)|Pacific Springs]] on Wyoming's [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1906.<ref>''Ventures and Adventures of Ezra Meeker: Or, Sixty Years of Frontier Life'' by Ezra Meeker. Rainer Printing Company 1908. ASIN: B000861WA8</ref>]]\n\nAs the trail developed it became marked by many cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.\n\nWhile the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was [[Independence, Missouri]], or [[Westport, Kansas City, Missouri|Westport]], (which was annexed into modern day [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across Kansas, and some towns became starting points, including [[Weston, Missouri|Weston]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|Fort Leavenworth]], [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], St. Joseph, and Omaha.\n\nThe Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], at the time the proposed capital of the [[Oregon Territory]]. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.\n\nAt dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nMany other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of [[California]]; and the Bozeman Trail to [[Montana]]. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established on both sides of the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may have been between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.\n\nRemnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the entire trail is a designated [[National Historic Trail]].\n\n=== Missouri ===\nInitially, the main \"jumping off point\" was the common head of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and Oregon trail&mdash;Independence, and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], they ferried across the Kansas River to start the trek across [[Kansas]] and points west. Another busy \"jumping off point\" was [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]\u2014established in 1843.<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web |url = http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/ |title = Saint Peters: Missouri |accessdate = August 30, 2007 |publisher = North America Travel Guide |author = North America Travel Guide }}</ref> In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to St. Louis and other ports on the combined [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and Mississippi River systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin, [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], and [[Fort Osage]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/spacepix/franklin-mo.html |title = Franklin Missouri The Beginning of the Santa Fe Trail |last = Larry and Carolyn |date =  |website = www.santafetrailresearch.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Iowa ===\n{{verbosity|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Bison Bull in Nebraska.jpg|thumb|A bison bull on a [[Nebraska]] wildlife refuge]]\n\nIn 1803, President Thomas Jefferson obtained from France the [[Louisiana Purchase]] for $15&nbsp;million (equivalent to about $230&nbsp;million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of Iowa and Missouri, located west of the Mississippi River and east of Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805\u20131806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many [[Sauk people|Sauk]] (Sac) natives and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Native Americans from [[Iowa Territory]]. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President [[Martin Van Buren]] on July 4, 1838, signed the U.S. Congress laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the Platte and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|fur trapper rendezvous]] traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the [[Mormons]], expelled from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], traversed Iowa (on part of the Mormon Trail) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of Nebraska at their [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] near the future city of Omaha, Nebraska.

For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction Kanesville and other towns became major \"jumping off places\" and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]] District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.) By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and \"jumping off places\" for travelers on the Mormon, California, Oregon, and other trails west.\n\n=== Kansas ===\n[[File:Ks rivers.png|thumb|Map of principal rivers in Kansas]]\n\nStarting initially in Independence, Missouri, or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Missouri, the initial trail follows the Santa Fe Trail into Kansas south of the [[Wakarusa River]]. After crossing [[Mount Oread]] at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], the trail crosses the Kansas River by [[ferry]] or boats near Topeka and crossed the Wakarusa and Black Vermillion rivers by ferries.  West of Topeka, the route paralleled what is now [[U.S. Route 24 in Kansas|U.S. Route 24]] until west of St. Mary's. After the Black Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to Nebraska paralleling the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] until reaching the south side of the Platte River.  Destinations along the Oregon Trail in Kansas included [[St. Mary's Mission (Kansas)|St. Mary's Mission]], [[Pottawatomie Indian Pay Station]], [[Louisville, Kansas#Oregon Trail crossing|Vieux's Vermilion Crossing]], [[Alcove Springs]] and [[Hollenberg Pony Express Station|Hollenberg Station]]. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Nebraska ===\n{{see also|California Hill|O'Fallons Bluff}}\n[[File:Chimney Rock NE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock, Nebraska]]]]\n\nThose emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in Missouri or Iowa used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in Nebraska. Several towns in Nebraska were used as ''jumping off places'' with Omaha eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. [[Fort Kearny]] (est. 1848) is about {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the Platte River west. The army maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.\n\n[[File:Platterivermap.png|thumb|Map showing the Platte River watershed, including the North Platte and South Platte tributaries]]\n\nThe Platte River and the North Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was \"too thin to plow and too thick to drink\". While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and [[cow dung|buffalo chip]]s for fuel.<ref>Mattes, Merrill J. ''The Great Platte River Road''. Bison Books, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8153-0}}</ref> The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|to|60|in|cm}} deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.\n\nIn the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of [[bison]] migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Native Americans fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte River. Travelers gathered and ignited dried cow dung to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River Valley into present-day Wyoming heading to Fort Laramie. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.globalclassroom.org/nebraska.html |title = The Oregon Trail in Western Nebraska |website = www.globalclassroom.org |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNotable landmarks in Nebraska include [[Courthouse and Jail Rocks]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], and [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park|Ash Hollow]] with its steep descent down [[Windlass Hill]] over the South Platte.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://gnelson.incolor.com/neocta.html |title = NE - OCTA Home Page |last = Nelson |first = Greg |website = gnelson.incolor.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nToday much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along Interstate 80 from Wyoming to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], Nebraska. From there [[U.S. Highway 30]] which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/upload/NE_ATRIG_Web.pdf Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming] NPS road guide, accessed February 8, 2010</ref>\n\n==== Cholera on the Platte River ====\nBecause of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years (1849\u20131855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. One of the side effects of cholera is acute diarrhea, which helps contaminate even more water unless it is isolated and/or treated. The cause of cholera (ingesting the ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' bacterium from contaminated water) and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Thousands of travelers on the combined California, Oregon, and Mormon trails succumbed to cholera between 1849 and 1855. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. Although also considered part of the [[Mormon Trail]], the grave of [[Rebecca Winters (pioneer)|Rebecca Winters]] is one of the few marked ones left. There are many cases cited involving people who were alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.\n\n=== Colorado ===\nA branch of the Oregon trail crossed the very northeast corner of [[Colorado]] if they followed the South Platte River to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present day [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] before entering Wyoming. Later settlers followed the Platte and South Platte Rivers into their settlements there (much of which became the state of Colorado).\n\n=== Wyoming ===\n{{Main|Emigrant Trail in Wyoming}}\n\nAfter crossing the South Platte River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], at the confluence of the Laramie and North Platte rivers, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |title = Chronological List of Fort Laramie History |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121161424/http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |archivedate = November 21, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> It was the last army outpost till travelers reached the coast.\n\nFort Laramie was the end of most cholera outbreaks which killed thousands along the lower Platte and North Platte from 1849 to 1855. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal\u2014up to 30&nbsp;percent of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.<ref>\"Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails\".

As the North Platte veers to the south, the trail crosses the North Platte to the Sweetwater River Valley, which heads almost due west. [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] is on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the [[Continental Divide]] at South Pass, Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing [[Big Sandy River (Wyoming)|Big Sandy Creek]]&mdash;about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1|foot}} deep&mdash;before hitting the Green River. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The deep, wide, swift, and treacherous Green River which eventually empties into the Colorado River, was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green, the main trail continued approximately southwest until the [[Blacks Fork]] of the Green River and Fort Bridger. From Fort Bridger the Mormon Trail continued southwest following the upgraded [[Hastings Cutoff]] through the [[Wasatch Mountains]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://scienceviews.com/historical/hastingsintro.html |title = The Hastings Cutoff Introduction |website = scienceviews.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref> From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the Bear River Valley.

The traffic in later years is undocumented.\n\nThe Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the {{convert|8800|ft|m}} Thompson Pass in the [[Wyoming Range]]. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another {{convert|8200|ft|m|adj=on}} pass on the [[Salt River Range]] of mountains and then descending into [[Star Valley]]. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of the town of [[Smoot, Wyoming|Smoot]]. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming&ndash;Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the [[Salt River (Wyoming)|Salt River]] (which drains into the Snake River) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River. After traveling down the Salt River Valley (Star Valley) about {{convert|20|mi|km}} north the road turned almost due west near the present town of [[Auburn, Wyoming|Auburn]], and entered into the present state of Idaho along Stump Creek. In Idaho, it followed the Stump Creek valley northwest until it crossed the [[Caribou Mountains (Idaho)|Caribou Mountains]] and proceeded past the south end of Grays Lake. The trail then proceeded almost due west to meet the main trail at Fort Hall; alternatively, a branch trail headed almost due south to meet the main trail near the present town of Soda Springs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://wyoshpo.state.wy.us/trailsdemo/landerroad.htm |title = Lander Road Cutoff Map |publisher = Wyoshpo.state.wy.us |date =  |accessdate = May 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref>\"Emigrant Trails of Southern Idaho\"; Bureau of Land Management & Idaho State Historical Society;1993; pp 117\u2013125 ASIN: B000KE2KTU</ref>\n\nNumerous landmarks are located along the trail in Wyoming including Independence Rock, [[Ayres Natural Bridge]] and [[Register Cliff]].\n\n=== Utah ===\nIn 1847, Brigham Young and the Mormon pioneers departed from the Oregon Trail at Fort Bridger in Wyoming and followed (and much improved) the rough trail originally recommended by [[Lansford Hastings]] to the Donner Party in 1846 through the Wasatch Mountains into Utah.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm |title = An Emigrant Train from the top of Big Mountain entering the valley of the Great Salt Lake |website = Utah Division of Parks and Recreation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211220440/http://www.americanwest.com/trails/pages/mormtrl.htm |archive-date = February 11, 2006 |url-status = }}</ref> After getting into Utah, they immediately started setting up irrigated farms and cities\u2014including Salt Lake City.

The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one \"detoured\" to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the [[Weber River|Weber]], Bear, and [[Malad River (Gooding County, Idaho)|Malad]] rivers, which were used mostly by travelers bound for Oregon or California.\n\n=== Idaho ===\n{{seealso|Oregon Trail (Ada County, Idaho segment)}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=September 2018}}\nThe main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the Bear River Valley, which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by a then-impassable cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.<ref>[http://www.idahohistory.net/OTbighill.html Big Hill Idaho]. OCTA Idaho accessed February 5, 2009</ref> (Much later, [[U.S. Highway 30|US-30]], using modern explosives and equipment, was built through this cut).

The springs here were a favorite attraction of the pioneers who marveled at the hot carbonated water and chugging \"steamboat\" springs. Many stopped and did their laundry in the hot water as there was usually plenty of good grass and fresh water available.<ref>Soda Springs quotes Idaho State Historical Society [http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0182.pdf] Retrieved February 25, 2009</ref> Just west of Soda Springs the Bear River turns southwest as it heads for the Great Salt Lake, and the main trail turns northwest to follow the [[Portneuf River (Idaho)|Portneuf River]] valley to Fort Hall, Idaho. Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the Snake River. It was established in 1832 by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth and company and later sold in 1837 to the Hudson's Bay Company. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests, and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites. The route from Fort Bridger to Fort Hall is about {{convert|210|mi|km}}, taking nine to twelve days.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Storm - Waiting for the Caravan - Walters 371940147.jpg|thumb|''Storm: Waiting for the Caravan'', by Alfred Jacob Miller]]\n\nAt Soda Springs was one branch of [[Emigrant Trail in Wyoming#Lander Road|Lander Road]] (established and built with government contractors in 1858), which had gone west from near South Pass, over the Salt River Mountains and down Star Valley before turning west near present-day Auburn, Wyoming, and entering Idaho.

Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale's Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of where he founded Fort Hall. Another possible crossing was a few miles upstream of Salmon Falls where some intrepid travelers floated their wagons and swam their stock across to join the north side trail.

This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Native Americans and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the {{convert|230|mi|km|adj=on}} cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the [[Big Lost River|Lost River]] part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of [[Arco, Idaho]], and wound through the northern part of what is now [[Craters of the Moon National Monument]]. From there it went southwest to [[Camas Prairie]] and ended at [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834-54)|Old Fort Boise]] on the [[Boise River]]. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along [[U.S. Highway 20|US-20]], [[U.S. Highway 26|US-26]], and [[U.S. Highway 93|US-93]] between Craters of the Moon National Monument and [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]].<ref>Goodale's Cutoff NPS [http://www.nps.gov/archive/crmo/goodale.htm] Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho ppmsca.10072u.jpg|thumb|View across top of [[Shoshone Falls]], [[Snake River]], Idaho ([[Timothy H.

The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or entangle the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.<ref>[http://www.stateparks.com/three_island_crossing.html Three Mile Island Crossing Park], Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\nThe north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about {{convert|130|mi|km}} long. The usually lush Boise River Valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Native American boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river\u2014they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. In present-day Idaho, [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] roughly follows the Oregon Trail from the Idaho-Oregon State border at the Snake River. Approximately {{convert|7|mi|spell=in}} east of [[Declo, Idaho|Declo]] in  present-day rural [[Cassia County, Idaho|Cassia County]], [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] meets the western terminus of the western section of [[Interstate 86 (west)|I-86]].

[[US Highway 30|US-30]] roughly follows the path of the Oregon Trail from [[Pocatello]] to [[Montpelier, Idaho|Montpelier]]\n\nStarting in about 1848 the South Alternate of Oregon Trail (also called the Snake River Cutoff) was developed as a spur off the main trail. It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day [[Ontario, Oregon]]. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water.

The trail then went to the [[Malheur River]] and then past [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]] on the Snake River, up the [[Burnt River (Oregon)|Burnt River]] canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]] before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the [[Whitman Mission]] near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the [[Whitman massacre|Whitmans were killed by Native Americans]]. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], Oregon, crossing the [[Umatilla River]], John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.\n\nArriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the [[Cascade Mountains]] and Mount Hood, some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the Columbia River. Once they transited the Cascade's [[Columbia River Gorge]] with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the {{convert|1.6|mi|km|adj=on}} portage around the [[Cascade Rapids]] before coming out near the [[Willamette River]] where Oregon City was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough Lolo Pass.\n\nSeveral Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved though the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.\n\nIn Central Oregon, there was the [[Santiam Wagon Road]] (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The [[Applegate Trail]] (established 1846), cutting off the California Trail from the Humboldt River in Nevada, crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. [[U.S. Route 99]] and [[Interstate 5]] through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.\n\n== Travel equipment ==\n=== Wagons and pack animals===\nThree types of [[Working animal|draft]] and [[pack animal]]s were used by Oregon Trail pioneers: [[oxen]], [[mule]]s, and [[horse]]s.<ref name=\"Dary\">David Dary, ''The Oregon Trail: An American Saga'' (Knopt, 2004), pp. 79-80.</ref>\n\nBy 1842, many emigrants favored oxen&mdash;castrated bulls (males) of the genus ''[[Bos]]'' (cattle), generally over four years old&mdash;as the best animal to pull wagons, because they were docile, generally healthy, and able to continue moving in difficult conditions such as mud and snow.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen could also survive on [[Tallgrass prairie|prairie grasses]] and [[Artemisia tridentata|sage]], unlike horses, who had to be fed. Moreover, oxen were less expensive to purchase and maintain than horses.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen also could stand idle for long periods without suffering damage to the feet and legs.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen were trained by leading, the use of a [[whip]] or [[goad]], and the use of oral commands (such as \"[[Gee and haw|Gee]]\" (right), \"[[Gee and haw|Haw]]\" (left), and \"Whoa\" (stop)).<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Two oxen were typically yoked together at the neck or head; the left ox was referred to as the \"near\" or \"nigh\" ox, and the right ox as the \"off\" ox.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> While no [[rein]]s, [[Bit (horse)|bits]], or [[halter]]s were needed, the trainer had to be forceful. Oxen typically traveled at a steady pace up to two miles an hour.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>\n\nOne drawback of oxen was the difficulty of shoeing. Oxen hooves are [[Cloven hoof|cloven]] (split), and they had to be shod with two curved pieces of metal, one on each side of the hoof. While horses and mules allowed themselves to be shod relatively easily, the process was more difficult with oxen, which would lie down and tuck their feet under themselves.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>  As a result, several men had to lift and hold an ox while he was being shod.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>\n\nMules were used by some emigrants.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> The competing merits of oxen and mules were hotly debated among emigrants.<ref name=\"Stamm\">Mike Stamm, ''The Mule Alternative: The Saddle Mule in the American West'' (1992), p. 61-62.</ref> Some found oxen to be more durable.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Others, by contrast, believed that mules were more durable, and mules may have had a lower attrition rate on the trail than oxen.<ref name=\"Stamm\"/> Like oxen, mules could survive on prairie grasses.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Mules were, however, notoriously ill-tempered.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Mules also cost about three times as much as oxen, a deciding factor for many emigrants.<ref name=\"Stamm\"/><ref>George R. Stewart, ''The California Trail: An Epic with Many Heroes'' (1962), p. 40.</ref>\n\nThree types of wagons were pulled:\n\n* [[Conestoga wagon]]s, a heavy type of covered wagon \n* [[Covered wagon]] (\"prairie schooners\"), lighter than a Conestoga and often just a covered farm wagon.\n* Studebaker (see [[Studebaker#History|\u00a7 History]])\n\n=== Food ===\nThe typical cost of food for four people for six months was about $150.{{when|date=March 2016}}<ref>{{cite book |author = Dary, David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

T. H. Jefferson, in his ''Brief Practice Advice'' guidebook for migrants, recommended that each adult take 200 pounds of flour: \"Take plenty of bread stuff; this is the staff of life when everything else runs short.\"<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nFood often took the form of [[cracker (food)|crackers]] or [[hardtack]]; Southerners sometimes chose [[cornmeal]] or [[pinole]] rather than [[wheat]] flour.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  Emigrants typically ate [[rice]] and [[bean]]s only at forts stopped at along the way, because boiling water was difficult on the trail, and fuel was not abundant.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> [[Lansford Hastings]] recommended that each emigrant take 200 pounds of [[flour]], 150 pounds of \"[[bacon]]\" (a word which, at the time, referred broadly to all forms of [[salt pork]]), 20 pounds of [[sugar]], and 10 pounds of [[salt]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/> [[Chipped beef]], rice, tea, dried beans, [[dried fruit]], [[saleratus]] (for raising bread), [[vinegar]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[tallow]] might also be taken.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/>  Joseph Ware's 1849 guide recommends that travelers take for each individual a barrel of flour or 180 pounds of ship's biscuit (i.e., hardtack), 150\u2013180 pounds of bacon, 60 pounds of beans or [[pea]]s, 25 pounds of [[rice]], 25 pounds of [[coffee]], 40 pounds of sugar, a keg of lard, 30 or 40 pounds of [[dried fruit]] ([[peach]]es or [[apple]]s), a keg of clear, [[Rendering (animal products)|rendered]] beef [[suet]] (to substitute for butter), as well as some [[vinegar]], salt, and [[Black pepper|pepper]].<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Many emigrant families also carried a small amount of [[tea]] and [[maple sugar]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\n[[Randolph B. Marcy]], an Army officer who wrote an 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended. He advised emigrants to drive cattle instead as a source of fresh beef.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Marcy also instructed emigrants to store sides of bacon in canvas bags or in boxes surrounded by [[bran]] to protect against extreme heat, which could make bacon [[Rancidification|go rancid]].<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy instructed emigrants to put salt pork on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy also recommended the use of [[pemmican]], as well as the storage of sugar in [[India-rubber]] or [[gutta-percha]] sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\n[[Canning]] technology had just begun to be developed, and it gained in popularity through the period of westward expansion. Initially, only upper-class migrants typically used canned goods.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> There are references in sources to canned cheese, fruit, meat, [[oyster]]s, and [[sardine]]s.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon. Rather than canned vegetables, Marcy suggested that travelers take dried vegetables, which had been used in the [[Crimean War]] and by the U.S. Army.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nSome pioneers took eggs and butter packed in barrels of flour, and some took [[dairy cow]]s along the trail.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> [[Hunting]] provided another source of food along the trail; pioneers hunted [[American bison]] as well as [[pronghorn antelope]], [[Odocoileus|deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], and wildfowl.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> From rivers and lakes, emigrants also fished for [[catfish]] and [[trout]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> When emigrants faced starvation, they would sometimes slaughter their animals (horses, mules, and oxen).<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  In desperate times, migrants would search for less-popular sources of food, including [[coyote]], [[fox]], [[jackrabbit]], [[marmot]], [[prairie dog]], and [[rattlesnake]] (nicknamed \"bush fish\" in the later period).<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\nAt the time, [[scurvy]] was well-recognized, but there was a lack of clear understanding of how to prevent the disease.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Nevertheless, pioneers' consumption of the wild [[berry|berries]] (including [[chokeberry]], [[gooseberry]], and [[serviceberry]]) and [[Ribes|currants]] that grew along the trail (particularly along the [[Platte River]]) helped make scurvy infrequent.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy's guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, [[citric acid]] could be drunk with sugar and water.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nEmigrant families, who were mostly middle-class, prided themselves on preparing a good table. Although operating [[Dutch oven]]s and kneading dough was difficult on the trail, many baked good bread and even pies.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\nFor fuel to heat food, travelers would collect [[cedar wood]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], or [[willow]] wood, when available, and sometimes dry prairie grass.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> More frequently, however, travelers relied on \"[[cow dung|buffalo chips]]\"\u2014dried bison dung\u2014to fuel fires.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Buffalo chips resembled rotten wood and would make clear and hot fires.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Chips burned quickly, however, and it took up to three [[bushel]]s of chips to heat a single meal.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  Collecting buffalo chips was a common task for children and was one chore that even very young children could carry out.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> As a result, \"memoirs written by those who were very young when they made the journey west invariably refer to this aspect of life on the trail.\"<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\n=== Clothing, equipment and supplies ===\nTobacco was popular, both for personal use, and for trading with natives and other pioneers. Each person brought at least two changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred once or twice a month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel.\n\nMost wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. Storage boxes were ideally the same height, so they could be arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for a sleeping platform.\n\nThe wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.\n\n[[File:Bierstadt Albert Oregon Trail.jpg|thumb|''Oregon Trail'', painting by [[Albert Bierstadt]], c. 1863]]\n\nTravelers brought books, Bibles, trail guides, and writing quills, ink, and paper for writing letters or journalling (about one in 200 kept a diary).<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 4\u20135|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nA belt and folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, and thread for mending were required. Spare leather was used for repairing shoes, harnesses, and other equipment. Some used goggles to keep dust out of the eyes.\n\nSaddles, bridles, hobbles, and ropes were needed if the party had a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra harnesses and spare wagon parts were often carried. Most carried steel shoes for horses, mules, or livestock. Tar was carried to help repair an ox's injured hoof.\n\nGoods, supplies, and equipment were often shared by fellow travelers.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149\u2013155|ps=.}}</ref> Items that were forgotten, broken, or worn out could be bought from a fellow traveler, post, or fort along the way. New iron shoes for horses, mules, and oxen were put on by blacksmiths found along the way. Equipment repairs and other goods could be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries. Emergency supplies, repairs, and livestock were often provided by local residents in California, Oregon, and Utah for late travelers on the trail who were hurrying to beat the snow.\n\nNon-essential items were often abandoned to lighten the load, or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or leaving behind their lower quality item when a better one was found abandoned along the road. Some profited by collecting discarded items, hauling them back to jumping off places, and reselling them. In the early years, Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and haul it to Salt Lake City, where supplies of all kinds were needed.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149\u2013150|ps=.}}</ref> Others would use discarded furniture, wagons, and wheels as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, [[Fort Laramie]] was known as \"Camp Sacrifice\" because of the large amounts merchandise discarded nearby.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|p= 150|ps=.}}</ref> Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their luxury items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead, and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Some travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City to be sold.\n\nProfessional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Oregon Trail Center |url = http://www.oregontrailcenter.org/HistoricalTrails/Supplies.htm |title = Supplies }}</ref> were used to clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often along the top of ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys.\n\n== Statistics ==\nOverall, some 268,000 pioneers used the Oregon Trail and its three primary offshoots, the [[Bozeman Trail|Bozeman]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] trails, to reach the West Coast, 1840\u20131860. Another 48,000 headed to Utah.

None of these original statistical records have been found\u2014the Army either lost them or destroyed them. Only some partial written copies of the Army records and notes recorded in several diaries have survived.\n\nEmigration to California spiked considerably with the [[Gold Rush of 1849|1849 gold rush]]. Following the discovery of gold, California remained the destination of choice for most emigrants on the trail up to 1860, with almost 200,000 people traveling there between 1849 and 1860.\n\nTravel diminished after 1860, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] caused considerable disruptions on the trail. Many of the people on the trail in 1861\u20131863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes<ref>Mattes, Merrill J.; op. cit.; p. 23</ref> has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861\u20131867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.\n\nMormon emigration records after 1860 are reasonably accurate, as newspaper and other accounts in Salt Lake City give most of the names of emigrants arriving each year from 1847 to 1868.<ref name=\"lds.org\"/> Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon caused a considerable increase in people using the trails, often in directions different from the original trail users.\n\nThough the numbers are significant in the context of the times, far more people chose to remain at home in the 31 states. Between 1840 and 1860, the population of the United States rose by 14&nbsp;million, yet only about 300,000 decided to make the trip. Many were discouraged by the cost, effort and danger of the trip.

Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.\n\n=== Costs ===\nThe cost of traveling over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the [[Midwest]] and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80&nbsp;percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150\u2013$200 per person.<ref>{{cite book |last = Dary |first = David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

Estimating is difficult because of the common practice of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid their being dug up by animals or natives. Graves were often put in the middle of a trail and then run over by the livestock to make them difficult to find. Disease was the main killer of trail travelers; [[cholera]] killed up to 3 percent of all travelers in the epidemic years from 1849 to 1855.\n\nNative attacks increased significantly after 1860, when most of the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Native American territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the [[Central Nevada Route]]. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the native trouble nearer the [[Snake River]]. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the [[South Platte]] to avoid local Native American hot spots.\n\nOther common causes of death included [[hypothermia]], drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. Being run over was a major cause of death, despite the wagons' only averaging 2\u20133 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving\u2014not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived threat of natives faded and hunting opportunities receded.\n\nA significant number of travelers were suffering from [[scurvy]] by the end of their trips. Their typical flour and salted pork/bacon diet had very little [[vitamin C]] in it. The diet in the mining camps was also typically low in fresh vegetables and fruit, which indirectly led to early deaths of many of the inhabitants. Some believe that scurvy deaths may have rivaled cholera as a killer, with most deaths occurring after the victim reached California.<ref>Steele, Volney M.D. ''Bleed, Blister, and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier''. Mountain Press Publishing Company, 2005. pp 115, 116. {{ISBN|978-0-87842-505-1}}</ref>\n\nMiscellaneous deaths included deaths by childbirth, falling trees, flash floods, homicides, kicks by animals, lightning strikes, snake bites, and stampedes. According to an evaluation by John Unruh,<ref name=unruh1993-408-410,516 /> a 4 percent death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail.\n\nReaching the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] before the start of the winter storms was critical for a successful completion of a trip. The most famous failure in that regard was that of the [[Donner Party]], whose members struggled to traverse what is today called [[Donner Pass]], in November 1846. When the last survivor was rescued in April 1847, 33 men, women, and children had died at [[Donner Lake]]; with some of the 48 survivors' confessing to having resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive.<ref>{{harvp|Peters|1996|pp=102-109|ps=.}}</ref>\n\n=== Disease ===\nDisease and being gay was the biggest killer on the Oregon Trail.

James Sinclair led a large party of nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony in 1841. These northern routes were largely abandoned after Britain ceded its claim to the southern Columbia River basin by way of the Oregon Treaty of 1846.\n\nThe longest trip was the voyage of about {{convert|13600|to|15000|mi|km}} on an uncomfortable sailing ship rounding the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between [[Antarctica]] and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost could be reduced to zero if you signed on as a crewman and worked as a common seaman. The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849\u201350, showed many thousands chose to do this.\n\nOther routes involved taking a ship to [[Col\u00f3n, Panama]] (then called Aspinwall) and a strenuous, disease ridden, five- to seven-day trip by canoe and mule over the Isthmus of Panama before catching a ship from [[Panama City, Panama]] to Oregon or California. This trip could be done from the east coast theoretically in less than two months if all ship connections were made without waits and typically cost about $450/person. Catching a fatal disease was a distinct possibility as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1852 learned when his unit of about 600 soldiers and some of their dependents traversed the Isthmus and lost about 120 men, women, and children.<ref>Brooks D. Simpson; Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822\u20131865; 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-395-65994-6}}, pg. 55</ref> This passage was considerably sped up and made safer in 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed at terrible cost in money and life across the Isthmus. The once treacherous {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} trip could be done in less than a day. The time and the cost for transit dropped as regular paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships went from ports on the east coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to Col\u00f3n, Panama ($80\u2013$100), across the Isthmus of Panama by railroad ($25) and by paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships to ports in California and Oregon ($100\u2013$150).\n\nAnother route was established by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] across [[Nicaragua]] in 1849. The {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] to the Atlantic Ocean helps drain the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Lake Nicaragua]]. From the western shore of Lake Nicaragua it is only about {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the Pacific Ocean. Vanderbilt decided to use paddle wheel steam ships from the U.S. to the San Juan River, small paddle wheel steam launches on the San Juan River, boats across Lake Nicaragua, and a stage coach to the Pacific where connections could be made with another ship headed to California, Oregon, etc.. Vanderbilt, by undercutting fares to the Isthmus of Panama and stealing many of the Panama Railroad workers, managed to attract roughly 30% of the California bound steam boat traffic. All his connections in Nicaragua were never completely worked out before the Panama Railroad's completion in 1855. Civil strife in Nicaragua and a payment to Cornelius Vanderbilt of a \"non-compete\" payment (bribe) of $56,000 per year killed the whole project in 1855.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.costarica-net-guide.com/vanderbilt.html |title = Nicaragua Route }}</ref>\n\nAnother possible route consisted of taking a ship to Mexico traversing the country and then catching another ship out of [[Acapulco, Mexico|Acapulco]], Mexico to California etc. This route was used by some adventurous travelers but was not too popular because of the difficulties of making connections and the often hostile population along the way.\n\nThe Gila Trail going along the [[Gila River]] in [[Arizona]], across the [[Colorado River]] and then across the [[Sonora Desert]] in California was scouted by [[Stephen Kearny]]'s troops and later by Captain [[Philip St. George Cooke]]'s [[Mormon Battalion]] in 1846 who were the first to take a wagon the whole way. This route was used by many gold hungry miners in 1849 and later but suffered from the disadvantage that you had to find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.\n\nRunning from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield Stage Line won the $600,000/yr. U.S. mail contract to deliver mail to San Francisco, California. As dictated by southern Congressional members, the {{convert|2800|mi|km|adj=on}} route ran from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri through [[Arkansas]], [[Indian Territory|Oklahoma Indian Territory]], Texas, [[New Mexico Territory]], and across the Sonora Desert before ending in San Francisco, California. Employing over 800 at its peak, it used 250 [[Stagecoach#Concord stagecoaches|Concord Stagecoaches]] seating 12 very crowded passengers in three rows. It used 1,800 head of stock, horses and mules and 139 relay stations to ensure the stages ran day and night. A one way fare of $200 delivered a very thrashed and tired passenger into San Francisco in 25 to 28 days. After traveling the route, ''[[New York Herald]]'' reporter Waterman Ormsby said, \"I now know what Hell is like. I've just had 24 days of it.\"\n\nOther ways to get to Oregon were: using the York Factory Express route across Canada, and down the Columbia River; ships from Hawaii, San Francisco, or other ports that stopped in Oregon; emigrants trailing up from California, etc. All provided a trickle of emigrants, but they were soon overwhelmed in numbers by the emigrants coming over the Oregon Trail.\n\nThe ultimate competitor arrived in 1869, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which cut travel time to about seven days at a low fare of about $60 (economy)<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/FAQs.html#Fare Railroad fares 1869] Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nOne of the enduring legacies of the Oregon Trail is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast.

The eastern part of the Oregon Trail spanned part of the future state of [[Kansas]], and nearly all of what are now the states of [[Nebraska]] and [[Wyoming]]. The western half of the trail spanned most of the future states of [[Idaho]] and Oregon.\n\nThe Oregon Trail was laid by [[fur trade]]rs and trappers from about 1811 to 1840, and was only passable on foot or by horseback. By 1836, when the first migrant [[wagon train]] was organized in [[Independence, Missouri]], a wagon trail had been cleared to [[Fort Hall, Idaho]]. Wagon trails were cleared increasingly farther west, and eventually reached all the way to the [[Willamette Valley]] in Oregon, at which point what came to be called the Oregon Trail was complete, even as almost annual improvements were made in the form of bridges, cutoffs, ferries, and roads, which made the trip faster and safer. From various starting points in Iowa, Missouri, or [[Nebraska Territory]], the routes converged along the lower [[Platte River|Platte River Valley]] near [[Fort Kearny]], Nebraska Territory, and led to rich farmlands west of the [[Rocky Mountains]].\n\nFrom the early to mid-1830s (and particularly through the years 1846\u20131869) the Oregon Trail and its many offshoots were used by about 400,000 settlers, farmers, miners, ranchers, and business owners and their families. The eastern half of the trail was also used by travelers on the [[California Trail]] (from 1843), [[Mormon Trail]] (from 1847), and [[Bozeman Trail]] (from 1863), before turning off to their separate destinations. Use of the trail declined as the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed in 1869, making the trip west substantially faster, cheaper, and safer. Today, modern highways, such as [[Interstate 80]] and [[Interstate 84 (Oregon\u2013Utah)|Interstate 84]], follow parts of the same course westward and pass through towns originally established to serve those using the Oregon Trail.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Oregon Trail}}\n\n=== Lewis and Clark Expedition ===\n{{Main|Lewis and Clark Expedition}}\n[[File:Carte Lewis-Clark Expedition-en.png|thumb|240px|Route of the Lewis and Clark expedition]]\nIn 1803, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] issued the following instructions to [[Meriwether Lewis]]: \"The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, & such principal stream of it, as, by its course & communication with the waters of the Pacific Ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregon, Colorado and/or other river may offer the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent, for the purposes of commerce.\"<ref>{{cite book |author = Federal Writers Project |title = The Oregon Trail: The Missouri River to the Pacific Ocean |url = https://archive.org/stream/oregontrailthemi00fedemiss#page/215/mode/1up |series = American Guide Series |location = New York |publisher = Hastings House |via = Open Library |year = 1939 |page = 215 |accessdate = January 11, 2013 }}</ref> Although Lewis and [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]] found a path to the Pacific Ocean, it was not until 1859 that a direct and practicable route, the [[Mullan Road]], connected the Missouri River to the [[Columbia River]].<ref>{{cite web |last = Johnson |first = Randall A. |title = The Mullan Road: A Real Northwest Passage |publisher = History Ink |url = http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=9202 |format = Reprint of 1995 article in ''The Pacific Northwesterner'', Vol. 39, No. 2 |accessdate = January 12, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe first land route across what is now the United States was mapped by the Lewis and Clark Expedition between 1804 and 1806. Lewis and Clark initially believed they had found a practical overland route to the west coast; however, the two passes they found going through the [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Lemhi Pass]] and [[Lolo Pass (Idaho-Montana)|Lolo Pass]], turned out to be much too difficult for prairie schooner wagons to pass through without considerable road work. On the return trip in 1806, they traveled from the Columbia River to the [[Snake River]] and the [[Clearwater River (Idaho)|Clearwater River]] over Lolo pass again. They then traveled overland up the [[Blackfoot River (Idaho)|Blackfoot River]] and crossed the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] at Lewis and Clark Pass and on to the head of the Missouri River. This was ultimately a shorter and faster route than the one they followed west. This route had the disadvantages of being much too rough for wagons and controlled by the [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] tribes. Even though Lewis and Clark had only traveled a narrow portion of the upper Missouri River drainage and part of the Columbia River drainage, these were considered the two major rivers draining most of the Rocky Mountains, and the expedition confirmed that there was no \"easy\" route through the northern Rocky Mountains as Jefferson had hoped. Nonetheless, this famous expedition had mapped both the eastern and western river valleys (Platte and Snake Rivers) that bookend the route of the Oregon Trail (and other [[emigrant trail]]s) across the continental divide{{mdash}}they just had not located the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] or some of the interconnecting valleys later used in the high country. They did show the way for the [[mountain men]], who within a decade would find a better way across, even if it was not to be an easy way.\n\n===Pacific Fur Company===\n{{Main|Pacific Fur Company}}\n\nFounded by [[John Jacob Astor]] as a subsidiary of his [[American Fur Company]] (AFC) in 1810, the [[Pacific Fur Company]] (PFC) operated in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the ongoing [[North American fur trade]]. Two movements of PFC employees were planned by Astor, one detachment to be sent to the Columbia River by the ''[[Tonquin (1807)|Tonquin]]'' and the other overland under an expedition led by [[Wilson Price Hunt]]. Hunt and his party were to find possible supply routes and trapping territories for further [[fur trade|fur trading]] posts. Upon arriving at the river in March 1811, the ''Tonquin'' crew began construction of what became [[Fort Astoria]]. The ship left supplies and men to continue work on the station and ventured north up the coast to [[Clayoquot Sound]] for a trading expedition. While anchored there, [[Jonathan Thorn]] insulted an elder [[Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations|Tla-o-qui-aht]] who was previously elected by the natives to negotiate a mutually satisfactory price for animal pelts. Soon after, the vessel was attacked and overwhelmed by the indigenous Clayoquot, killing many of the crew. Its [[Quinault people|Quinault]] interpreter survived, and later told the PFC management at Fort Astoria of the destruction. The next day, the ship was blown up by surviving crew members.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/tonquin |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130606010101/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/tonquin |title = Tonquin |encyclopedia = The Canadian Encyclopedia |archive-date = June 6, 2013 |url-status = dead |accessdate = May 11, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&dq=tonquin+canadian+encyclopedia&q=tonquin#v=snippet&q=tonquin&f=false |title = The Canadian Encyclopedia |last = Marsh |first = James H. |date = 1999 |publisher = The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn = 9780771020995 |language = en }}</ref>\n[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|thumb|[[United States territorial acquisitions|U.S. territorial acquisitions]]{{endash}}portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.]]\nUnder Hunt, fearing attack by the [[Niitsitapi]], the overland expedition veered south of Lewis and Clark's route into what is now Wyoming and in the process passed across [[Union Pass]] and into [[Jackson Hole]], Wyoming. From there they went over the [[Teton Range]] via [[Teton Pass]] and then down to the Snake River into modern [[Idaho]]. They abandoned their horses at the Snake River, made dugout canoes, and attempted to use the river for transport. After a few days' travel they soon discovered that steep canyons, waterfalls and impassable rapids made travel by river impossible. Too far from their horses to retrieve them, they had to cache most of their goods and walk the rest of the way to the Columbia River where they made new boats and traveled to the newly established Fort Astoria. The expedition demonstrated that much of the route along the Snake River plain and across to the Columbia was passable by pack train or with minimal improvements, even wagons.<ref>{{cite web |title = Map of Astorian expedition, Lewis and Clark expedition, Oregon Trail, etc. in Pacific Northwest etc |url = http://www.oregon.com/history/oregon_trail_maps.cfm |publisher = oregon.com |accessdate = December 31, 2008 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090202113800/http://www.oregon.com/history/oregon_trail_maps.cfm |archivedate = February 2, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> This knowledge would be incorporated into the concatenated trail segments as the Oregon Trail took its early shape.\n\nPacific Fur Company partner [[Robert Stuart (explorer)|Robert Stuart]] led a small group of men back east to report to Astor.

Painting from memory by Alfred Jacob Miller]]\n\nIn August 1811, three months after Fort Astor was established, [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] and his team of British North West Company explorers came floating down the Columbia to Fort Astoria. He had just completed a journey through much of western Canada and most of the Columbia River drainage system. He was mapping the country for possible fur trading posts. Along the way he camped at the confluence of the Columbia and Snake rivers and posted a notice claiming the land for Britain and stating the intention of the North West Company to build a fort on the site ([[Fort Nez Perces]] was later established there). Astor, concerned the British navy would seize their forts and supplies in the War of 1812, sold to the North West Company in 1812 their forts, supplies and furs on the Columbia and Snake River. The North West Company started establishing more forts and trading posts of its own.\n\nBy 1821, when armed hostilities broke out with its [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) rivals, the North West Company was pressured by the British government to merge with the HBC. The HBC had nearly a complete monopoly on trading (and most governing issues) in the Columbia District, or Oregon Country as it was referred to by the Americans, and also in [[Rupert's Land]]. That year the British parliament passed a statute applying the laws of [[Upper Canada]] to the district and giving the HBC power to enforce those laws.\n\nFrom 1812 to 1840, the British, through the HBC, had nearly complete control of the Pacific Northwest and the western half of the Oregon Trail. In theory, the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the War of 1812, restored possession of Oregon territory to the United States. \"Joint occupation\" of the region was formally established by the [[Anglo-American Convention of 1818]]. The British, through the HBC, tried to discourage any U.S. trappers, traders and settlers from work or settlement in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Breaking up Camp at Sunrise - Walters 371940142.jpg|thumb|left|''Breaking up Camp at Sunrise'', by [[Alfred Jacob Miller]]]]\n\nBy overland travel, American missionaries and early settlers (initially mostly ex-trappers) started showing up in Oregon around 1824.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Although officially the HBC discouraged settlement because it interfered with its lucrative fur trade, its Chief Factor at Fort Vancouver, [[John McLoughlin]], gave substantial help, including employment, until they could get established. In the early 1840s thousands of American settlers arrived and soon greatly outnumbered the British settlers in Oregon.<ref name=\"Mackie1997\">{{cite book |last = Mackie |first = Richard Somerset |title = Trading Beyond the Mountains: The British Fur Trade on the Pacific; 1793 - 1843 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VKXgJw6K088C&pg=PA318 |accessdate = May 11, 2013 |year = 1997 |publisher = UBC Press |isbn = 978-0-7748-0613-8 |page = 318 }}</ref> McLoughlin, despite working for the HBC, gave help in the form of loans, medical care, shelter, clothing, food, supplies and seed to U.S. emigrants. These new emigrants often arrived in Oregon tired, worn out, nearly penniless, with insufficient food or supplies, just as winter was coming on. McLoughlin would later be hailed as the Father of Oregon.\n\nThe [[York Factory Express]], establishing another route to the Oregon territory, evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the North West Company between Fort Astoria and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], Ontario on [[Lake Superior]]. By 1825 the HBC started using two brigades, each setting out from opposite ends of the express route\u2014one from [[Fort Vancouver]] on the Columbia River and the other from [[York Factory]] on Hudson Bay\u2014in spring and passing each other in the middle of the continent. This established a \"quick\"&mdash;about 100 days for {{convert|2600|mi|km}} one way&mdash;to resupply its forts and fur trading centers as well as collecting the furs the posts had bought and transmitting messages between Fort Vancouver and York Factory on Hudson Bay.[[File:York-Factory-Express.png|thumb|HBC's York Factory Express trade route, 1820s to 1840s. Modern political boundaries shown.]]\n\nThe HBC built a new much larger Fort Vancouver in 1824 slightly upstream of Fort Astoria on the north side of the Columbia River (they were hoping the Columbia would be the future Canada\u2013U.S. border). The fort quickly became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to the Pacific (via [[Cape Horn]]) to drop off supplies and trade goods in its trading posts in the Pacific Northwest and pick up the accumulated furs used to pay for these supplies. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and from [[Russian Alaska]] into Mexican-controlled California. At its pinnacle in about 1840, Fort Vancouver and its Factor (manager) watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, 6 ships, and about 600 employees.\n\nWhen American emigration over the Oregon Trail began in earnest in the early 1840s, for many settlers the fort became the last stop on the Oregon Trail where they could get supplies, aid and help before starting their homesteads.<ref name=\"Mackie1997\"/> Fort Vancouver was the main re-supply point for nearly all Oregon trail travelers until U.S. towns could be established. The HBC established [[Fort Colvile]] in 1825 on the Columbia River near [[Kettle Falls]] as a good site to collect furs and control the upper Columbia River fur trade.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nwcouncil.org/history/FortColville.asp |title = Fort Colville |publisher = Nwcouncil.org |accessdate = March 19, 2011 }}</ref> [[Fort Nisqually]] was built near the present town of [[DuPont, Washington|DuPont]], Washington and was the first HBC fort on Puget Sound. [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] was erected in 1843 and became the headquarters of operations in British Columbia, eventually growing into modern-day [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], the capital city of British Columbia.\n\n[[File:Oregoncountry.png|thumb|left|The Oregon Country/Columbia District stretched from 42'N to 54 40'N. The most heavily disputed portion is highlighted.]]\n\nBy 1840 the HBC had three forts: [[Fort Hall]] (purchased from [[Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth]] in 1837), [[Fort Boise]] and [[Fort Nez Perce]] on the western end of the Oregon Trail route as well as Fort Vancouver near its terminus in the [[Willamette Valley]]. With minor exceptions they all gave substantial and often desperately needed aid to the early Oregon Trail pioneers.\n\nWhen the fur trade slowed in 1840 because of fashion changes in men's hats, the value of the Pacific Northwest to the British was seriously diminished. Canada had few potential settlers who were willing to move more than {{convert|2500|mi|km}} to the Pacific Northwest, although several hundred ex-trappers, British and American, and their families did start settling in Oregon, Washington and California. They used most of the York Express route through northern Canada. In 1841, [[James Sinclair (fur trapper)|James Sinclair]], on orders from Sir [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]], guided nearly 200 settlers from the [[Red River Colony]] (located at the junction of the [[Assiniboine River]] and [[Red River of the North|Red River]] near present [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], Canada) into the Oregon territory.<ref>[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~orgenweb/furtrade.html Red River Settlers in Oregon], Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.newpghs.com/historical-maps |title = Area Histories: Historical Maps |last =  |first =  |date =  |website = North East Winnipeg Historical Society Inc.

The British lost the land north of the Columbia River they had so long controlled. The new [[Canada\u2013United States border]] was established much further north at the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. The treaty granted the HBC navigation rights on the Columbia River for supplying their fur posts, clear titles to their trading post properties allowing them to be sold later if they wanted, and left the British with good anchorages at [[Vancouver]] and Victoria. It gave the United States what it mostly wanted, a \"reasonable\" boundary and a good anchorage on the West Coast in Puget Sound. While there were almost no United States settlers in the future state of Washington in 1846, the United States had already demonstrated it could induce thousands of settlers to go to the Oregon Territory, and it would be only a short time before they would vastly outnumber the few hundred HBC employees and retirees living in Washington.\n\n=== Great American Desert ===\n[[File:Trail ruts State Hist site Wyoming.jpg|thumb|[[Oregon Trail Ruts (Guernsey, Wyoming)|Trail ruts]] near Guernsey, Wyoming]]\n\nReports from expeditions in 1806 by Lieutenant [[Zebulon Pike]] and in 1819 by Major [[Stephen Harriman Long|Stephen Long]] described the [[Great Plains]] as \"unfit for human habitation\" and as \"The [[Great American Desert]]\". These descriptions were mainly based on the relative lack of timber and surface water. The images of sandy wastelands conjured up by terms like \"desert\" were tempered by the many reports of vast herds of millions of [[Plains Bison]] that somehow managed to live in this \"desert\".<ref>It was not until later that the [[Ogallala Aquifer]] was discovered and used for irrigation, dry farming techniques developed and railtracks laid.</ref> In the 1840s, the Great Plains appeared to be unattractive for settlement and were illegal for homesteading until well after 1846\u2014initially it was set aside by the U.S. government for Native American settlements. The next available land for general settlement, Oregon, appeared to be free for the taking and had fertile lands, disease free climate ([[yellow fever]] and [[malaria]] were then prevalent in much of the Missouri and [[Mississippi River]] drainage), extensive uncut, unclaimed forests, big rivers, potential seaports, and only a few nominally British settlers.\n\n=== Fur traders, trappers and explorers ===\nFur trappers, often working for fur traders, followed nearly all possible streams looking for beaver in the years (1812\u201340) the fur trade was active.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |title = IDAHO FUR TRADE |accessdate = April 16, 2009 |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090416142248/http://www.history.idaho.gov/Reference%20Series/0444.pdf |archivedate = April 16, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> Fur traders included [[Manuel Lisa]], Robert Stuart, [[William Henry Ashley]], [[Jedediah Smith]], [[William Sublette]], [[Andrew Henry (fur trader)|Andrew Henry]], [[Thomas Fitzpatrick (trapper)|Thomas Fitzpatrick]], [[Kit Carson]], [[Jim Bridger]], [[Peter Skene Ogden]], [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]], [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]], [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]], [[Alexander Ross (fur trader)|Alexander Ross]], [[James Sinclair (fur trader)|James Sinclair]], and other [[mountain man|mountain men]]. Besides discovering and naming many of the rivers and mountains in the [[Intermountain West]] and Pacific Northwest, they often kept diaries of their travels and were available as guides and consultants when the trail started to become open for general travel. The fur trade business wound down to a very low level just as the Oregon trail traffic seriously began around 1840.\n\n[[File:Alfred Jacob Miller - Our Camp - Walters 371940177.jpg|thumb|''Our Camp'', by Alfred Jacob Miller]]\n\nIn fall of 1823, Jedediah Smith and Thomas Fitzpatrick led their trapping crew south from the [[Yellowstone River]] to the Sweetwater River. They were looking for a safe location to spend the winter. Smith reasoned since the Sweetwater flowed east it must eventually run into the Missouri River. Trying to transport their extensive fur collection down the Sweetwater and North Platte River, they found after a near disastrous canoe crash that the rivers were too swift and rough for water passage. On July 4, 1824, they cached their furs under a dome of rock they named [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] and started their long trek on foot to the Missouri River. Upon arriving back in a settled area they bought pack horses (on credit) and retrieved their furs. They had re-discovered the route that Robert Stuart had taken in 1813\u2014eleven years before. Thomas Fitzpatrick was often hired as a guide when the fur trade dwindled in 1840. Smith was killed by Comanche natives around 1831.\n\n[[File:JedediahSmithEnglishVersion.png|thumb|left|The exploration of the West by [[Jedediah Smith]]]]\n\nUp to 3,000 mountain men were [[animal trapping|trappers]] and [[Exploration|explorers]], employed by various British and United States fur companies or working as free trappers, who roamed the North American Rocky Mountains from about 1810 to the early 1840s. They usually traveled in small groups for mutual support and protection. Trapping took place in the fall when the fur became prime. Mountain men primarily trapped [[beaver]] and sold the skins. A good beaver skin could bring up to $4 at a time when a man's wage was often $1 per day. Some were more interested in exploring the West. In 1825, the first significant American [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] occurred on the Henry's Fork of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]. The trading supplies were brought in by a large party using pack trains originating on the Missouri River. These pack trains were then used to haul out the fur bales. They normally used the north side of the Platte River\u2014the same route used 20 years later by the [[Mormon Trail]]. For the next 15 years the American rendezvous was an annual event moving to different locations, usually somewhere on the Green River in the future state of [[Wyoming]]. Each rendezvous, occurring during the slack summer period, allowed the fur traders to trade for and collect the furs from the trappers and their Native American allies without having the expense of building or maintaining a fort or wintering over in the cold Rockies. In only a few weeks at a rendezvous a year's worth of trading and celebrating would take place as the traders took their furs and remaining supplies back east for the winter and the trappers faced another fall and winter with new supplies. Trapper [[Jim Beckwourth]] described the scene as one of \"Mirth, songs, dancing, shouting, trading, running, jumping, singing, racing, target-shooting, yarns, frolic, with all sorts of extravagances that white men or Indians could invent.\"<ref>Gowans, Fred R. ''Rocky Mountain Rendezvous'', pg 27. Gibbs Smith Publisher. {{ISBN|1-58685-756-8}}</ref> In 1830, William Sublette brought the first wagons carrying his trading goods up the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers before crossing over South Pass to a fur trade rendezvous on the Green River near the future town of [[Big Piney, Wyoming|Big Piney]], Wyoming. He had a crew that dug out the gullies and river crossings and cleared the brush where needed. This established that the eastern part of most of the Oregon Trail was passable by wagons. In the late 1830s the HBC instituted a policy intended to destroy or weaken the American fur trade companies. The HBC's annual collection and re-supply Snake River Expedition was transformed to a trading enterprise. Beginning in 1834, it visited the American Rendezvous to undersell the American traders\u2014losing money but undercutting the American fur traders. By 1840 the fashion in Europe and Britain shifted away from the formerly very popular beaver felt hats and prices for furs rapidly declined and the trapping almost ceased.\n\n[[File:Greenutrivermap.png|thumb|Map of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] watershed]]\n\nFur traders tried to use the Platte River, the main route of the eastern Oregon Trail, for transport but soon gave up in frustration as its many channels and islands combined with its muddy waters were too shallow, crooked and unpredictable to use for water transport. The Platte proved to be unnavigable. The Platte River and North Platte River Valley, however, became an easy roadway for wagons, with its nearly flat plain sloping easily up and heading almost due west.\n\nThere were several U.S. government-sponsored explorers who explored part of the Oregon Trail and wrote extensively about their explorations. Captain [[Benjamin Bonneville]] on his expedition of 1832 to 1834 explored much of the Oregon trail and brought wagons up the Platte, North Platte, Sweetwater route across South Pass to the Green River in Wyoming. He explored most of Idaho and the Oregon Trail to the Columbia. The account of his explorations in the west was published by [[Washington Irving]] in 1838.<ref>The Adventures of Captain Bonneville [[s:The Adventures of Captain Bonneville]]</ref> [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] of the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|U.S. Army's Corps of Topographical Engineers]] and his guide Kit Carson led three expeditions from 1842 to 1846 over parts of California and Oregon. His explorations were written up by him and his wife [[Jessie Benton Fr\u00e9mont]] and were widely published. The first detailed map of California and Oregon were drawn by Fr\u00e9mont and his [[Topography as the study of place|topographer]]s and [[Cartography|cartographers]] in about 1848.<ref>[http://www.davidrumsey.com/maps5489.html Fr\u00e9mont's Map of California and Oregon], Retrieved December 23, 2009</ref>\n\n=== Missionaries ===\nIn 1834, The Dalles [[Methodist Mission]] was founded by Reverend [[Jason Lee (missionary)|Jason Lee]] just east of [[Mount Hood]] on the Columbia River. In 1836, [[Henry H. Spalding]] and [[Marcus Whitman]] traveled west to establish the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] near modern-day [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], Washington.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=1BD1D5D9-CBEA-5E8B-C0609C63D5C881B1 |title = Protestant Ladder |website = Oregon Historical Society |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120614055025/http://www.ohs.org/education/oregonhistory/historical_records/dspDocument.cfm?doc_ID=1BD1D5D9-CBEA-5E8B-C0609C63D5C881B1 |archive-date = June 14, 2012 |url-status = }}</ref> The party included the wives of the two men, [[Narcissa Whitman]] and [[Eliza Hart Spalding]], who became the first European-American women to cross the Rocky Mountains. En route, the party accompanied American fur traders going to the 1836 rendezvous on the Green River in Wyoming and then joined Hudson's Bay Company fur traders traveling west to Fort Nez Perce (also called [[Fort Walla Walla]]). The group was the first to travel in wagons all the way to Fort Hall, where the wagons were abandoned at the urging of their guides. They used pack animals for the rest of the trip to Fort Walla Walla and then floated by boat to Fort Vancouver to get supplies before returning to start their missions. Other missionaries, mostly husband and wife teams using wagon and pack trains, established missions in the Willamette Valley, as well as various locations in the future states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.\n\n=== Early emigrants ===\nOn May 1, 1839, a group of eighteen men from [[Peoria, Illinois]], set out with the intention of colonizing the Oregon country on behalf of the United States of America and drive out the HBC operating there. The men of the [[Peoria Party]] were among the first pioneers to traverse most of the Oregon Trail. The men were initially led by [[Thomas J. Farnham]] and called themselves the [[Oregon Dragoons]]. They carried a large flag emblazoned with their motto \"''Oregon Or The Grave''\". Although the group split up near [[Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site|Bent's Fort]] on the [[South Platte]] and Farnham was deposed as leader, nine of their members eventually did reach Oregon.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oregonpioneers.com/1839.htm |title = Oregon Emigrants 1839 |publisher = Oregonpioneers.com |date =  |accessdate = May 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1840, [[Robert Newell (politician)|Robert Newell]], [[Joseph L.

The group set out for California, but about half the party left the original group at [[Soda Springs, Idaho|Soda Springs]], Idaho, and proceeded to the Willamette Valley in Oregon, leaving their wagons at Fort Hall.\n\nOn May 16, 1842, the second organized wagon train set out from Elm Grove, Missouri, with more than 100 pioneers.<ref>Members of the party later disagreed over the size of the party, one stating 160 adults and children were in the party, while another counted 105.</ref> The party was led by [[Elijah White]]. The group broke up after passing Fort Hall with most of the single men hurrying ahead and the families following later.\n\n=== Great Migration of 1843 ===\n[[File:ColumbiaAmericasGreatHighway040.png|thumb|A wagon converted to a raft for the last stage of the emigration.]]\n\nIn what was dubbed \"The Great Migration of 1843\" or the \"Wagon Train of 1843\", an estimated 700 to 1,000 emigrants left for Oregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |title = The Wagon Train of 1843: The Great Migration |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531061021/http://www.peak.org/~mransom/pioneers.html |archive-date = May 31, 2008 |url-status =  |access-date = December 22, 2007 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/events/1840_1850.htm Events in The West: 1840\u20131850] PBS. Retrieved December 22, 2007.</ref> They were led initially by [[John Gantt]], a former U.S. Army Captain and fur trader who was contracted to guide the train to Fort Hall for $1 per person. The winter before, Marcus Whitman had made a brutal mid-winter trip from Oregon to St. Louis to appeal a decision by his mission backers to abandon several of the Oregon missions. He joined the wagon train at the Platte River for the return trip. When the pioneers were told at Fort Hall by agents from the Hudson's Bay Company that they should abandon their wagons there and use pack animals the rest of the way, Whitman disagreed and volunteered to lead the wagons to Oregon. He believed the wagon trains were large enough that they could build whatever road improvements they needed to make the trip with their wagons. The biggest obstacle they faced was in the [[Blue Mountains (Oregon)|Blue Mountains]] of Oregon where they had to cut and clear a trail through heavy timber. The wagons were stopped at [[The Dalles, Oregon|The Dalles]], Oregon, by the lack of a road around Mount Hood. The wagons had to be disassembled and floated down the treacherous Columbia River and the animals herded over the rough [[Lolo Pass (Oregon)|Lolo trail]] to get by Mt. Hood. Nearly all of the settlers in the 1843 wagon trains arrived in the Willamette Valley by early October. A passable wagon trail now existed from the Missouri River to The Dalles. Jesse Applegate's account of the emigration, \"[[A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]],\" has been described as \"the best bit of literature left to us by any participant in the [Oregon] pioneer movement...\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reviews|work=Oregon Historical Quarterly|volume=34|number=4|year=1935}}</ref> and has been republished several times from 1868 to 1990.<ref>{{cite journal |title=[[wikisource:en:Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843|Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 1/A Day with the Cow Column in 1843]] |work=The Oregon Historical Quarterly |year=1900 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, the [[Barlow Road]] was completed around Mount Hood, providing a rough but completely passable wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Willamette Valley: about {{convert|2000|mi|km}}.\n\n=== Oregon Country ===\nIn 1843, settlers of the Willamette Valley drafted the [[Organic Laws of Oregon]] organizing land claims within the Oregon Country. Married couples were granted at no cost (except for the requirement to work and improve the land) up to {{convert|640|acre|km2}} (a [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] or square mile), and unmarried settlers could claim {{convert|320|acre|km2}}. As the group was a provisional government with no authority, these claims were not valid under United States or British law, but they were eventually honored by the United States in the [[Donation Land Act]] of 1850. The Donation Land Act provided for married settlers to be granted {{convert|320|acre|km2}} and unmarried settlers {{convert|160|acre|km2}}. Following the expiration of the act in 1854 the land was no longer free but cost $1.25 per acre ($3.09/hectare) with a limit of {{convert|320|acre|km2}}\u2014the same as most other unimproved government land.\n\n=== Women on the Overland Trail ===\nConsensus interpretations, as found in John Faragher's book, ''Women and Men on the Overland Trail'' (1979), held that men and women's power within marriage was uneven. This meant that women did not experience the trail as liberating, but instead only found harder work than they had handled back east. However, feminist scholarship, by historians such as Lillian Schlissel,<ref>Lillian Schlissel, \"Women's diaries on the western frontier.\" ''American Studies'' (1977): 87-100 [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2301/2260 online].</ref> Sandra Myres,<ref>Sandra L.

Whereas men might deem the dangers of the trail acceptable if there was a strong economic reward at the end, women viewed those dangers as threatening to the stability and survival of the family. Once they arrived at their new western home, women's public role in building western communities and participating in the western economy gave them a greater authority than they had known back East. There was a \"female frontier\" that was distinct and different from that experienced by men.<ref>Kenneth L. Holmes, ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, Introduction by Anne M. Butler, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, (1983) pp 1-10.</ref>\n\nWomen's diaries kept during their travels or the letters they wrote home once they arrived at their destination supports these contentions. Women wrote with sadness and concern of the numerous deaths along the trail. Anna Maria King wrote to her family in 1845 about her trip to the [[Luckiamute River|Luckiamute Valley]] Oregon and of the multiple deaths experienced by her traveling group:\n\n<blockquote>But listen to the deaths: Sally Chambers, John King and his wife, their little daughter Electa and their babe, a son 9 months old, and Dulancy C. Norton's sister are gone. Mr. A. Fuller lost his wife and daughter Tabitha. Eight of our two families have gone to their long home.<ref>From the letter of Anna Maria King, in Covered Wagon Women, Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 41.</ref></blockquote>\n \nSimilarly, emigrant [[Martha Gay Masterson]], who traveled the trail with her family at the age of 13, mentioned the fascination she and other children felt for the graves and loose skulls they would find near their camps.<ref>Peavy, Linda S., and Ursula Smith. ''Pioneer Women: The Lives of Women on the Frontier''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, p. 40.</ref>\n \nAnna Maria King, like many other women, also advised family and friends back home of the realities of the trip and offered advice on how to prepare for the trip. Women also reacted and responded, often enthusiastically, to the landscape of the West. Betsey Bayley in a letter to her sister, Lucy P. Griffith described how travelers responded to the new environment they encountered:\n\n<blockquote>The mountains looked like volcanoes and the appearance that one day there had been an awful thundering of volcanoes and a burning world. The valleys were all covered with a white crust and looked like [[salaratus]]. Some of the company used it to raise their bread.<ref>From the letter of Betsey Bayley, in ''Covered Wagon Women,'' Volume 1, by Kenneth L. Holmes, ebook version, University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln, Nebraska, 1983, Page 35.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Mormon emigration ===\n{{Main|Mormon Trail}}\n\nFollowing persecution and mob action in [[Missouri]], [[Illinois]], and other states, and the assassination of their prophet [[Joseph Smith]] in 1844, [[Mormon]] leader [[Brigham Young]] was chosen by the leaders of the [[Latter Day Saints]] (LDS) church to lead the Mormon settlers west. He chose to lead his people to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in present-day Utah. In 1847 Young led a small, especially picked fast-moving group of men and women from their [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska|Winter Quarters]] encampments near [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, and their approximately 50 temporary settlements on the Missouri River in [[Iowa]] including [[Council Bluffs]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |title = Mormons in Iowa towns |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719155702/http://winterquarters.byu.edu/pages/settlements.htm |archive-date = July 19, 2011 |url-status =  |access-date = January 5, 2009 }}</ref> About 2,200 LDS pioneers went that first year as they filtered in from [[Mississippi]], Colorado, California, and several other states. The initial pioneers were charged with establishing farms, growing crops, building fences and herds, and establishing preliminary settlements to feed and support the many thousands of emigrants expected in the coming years. After ferrying across the Missouri River and establishing wagon trains near what became Omaha, the Mormons followed the northern bank of the Platte River in [[Nebraska]] to [[Fort Laramie]] in present-day Wyoming. They initially started out in 1848 with trains of several thousand emigrants, which were rapidly split into smaller groups to be more easily accommodated at the limited springs and acceptable camping places on the trail. Organized as a complete evacuation from their previous homes, farms, and cities in Illinois, Missouri, and Iowa, this group consisted of entire families with no one left behind. The much larger presence of women and children meant these wagon trains did not try to cover as much ground in a single day as Oregon and California bound emigrants. Typically taking about 100 days to cover the {{convert|1000|mi|km}} trip to Salt Lake City. (The Oregon and California emigrants typically averaged about {{convert|15|mi|km}} per day.) In Wyoming, the Mormon emigrants followed the main Oregon/California/Mormon Trail through Wyoming to [[Fort Bridger]], where they split from the main trail and followed (and improved) the rough path known as [[Hastings Cutoff]], used by the ill-fated [[Donner Party]] in 1846.\n\nBetween 1847 and 1860, over 43,000 Mormon settlers and tens of thousands of travelers on the [[California Trail]] and Oregon Trail followed Young to Utah. After 1848, the travelers headed to California or Oregon resupplied at the Salt Lake Valley, and then went back over the [[Salt Lake Cutoff]], rejoining the trail near the future Idaho&ndash;Utah border at the [[City of Rocks National Reserve|City of Rocks]] in Idaho.\n\nStarting in 1855, many of the poorer Mormon travelers made the trek with hand built [[Mormon handcart pioneers|handcart]]s and fewer wagons. Guided by experienced guides, handcarts\u2014pulled and pushed by two to four people\u2014were as fast as ox-drawn wagons and allowed them to bring {{convert|75|to|100|lb|kg}} of possessions plus some food, bedding, and tents to Utah. Accompanying wagons carried more food and supplies. Upon arrival in Utah, the handcart pioneers were given or found jobs and accommodations by individual Mormon families for the winter until they could become established. About 3,000 out of over 60,000 [[Mormon pioneers]] came across with handcarts.\n\nAlong the Mormon Trail, the Mormon pioneers established a number of ferries and made trail improvements to help later travelers and earn much needed money. One of the better known ferries was the Mormon Ferry across the North Platte near the future site of [[Fort Caspar]] in Wyoming which operated between 1848 and 1852 and the [[Green River, Utah|Green River]] ferry near Fort Bridger which operated from 1847 to 1856. The ferries were free for Mormon settlers while all others were charged a toll of from $3 to $8.\n\n=== California Gold Rush ===\n{{Main|California Trail}}\n\nIn January 1848, James Marshall found gold in the Sierra Nevada portion of the [[American River]], sparking the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>{{cite book |last = Peters |first = Arthur K. |title = Seven trail west |publisher = Abbeville Press |year = 1996 |isbn = 978-1-55859-782-2 |url = https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete |url-access = registration |page = [https://archive.org/details/seventrailswest00pete/page/109 109] |ref = harv }}</ref> It is estimated that about two-thirds of the male population in Oregon went to California in 1848 to cash in on the opportunity. To get there, they helped build the Lassen Branch of the Applegate-Lassen Trail by cutting a wagon road through extensive forests. Many returned with significant gold which helped jump-start the Oregon economy. Over the next decade, gold seekers from the [[Midwest|Midwestern United States]] and [[East Coast of the United States]] dramatically increased traffic on the Oregon and California Trails. The \"forty-niners\" often chose speed over safety and opted to use shortcuts such as the [[Sublette Cutoff|Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff]] in Wyoming which reduced travel time by almost seven days but spanned nearly {{convert|45|mi|km}} of desert without water, grass, or fuel for fires.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |title = American West - Oregon Trail |website = American West |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205115352/http://americanwest.com/trails/pages/oretrail.htm |archive-date = December 5, 2010 |url-status = }}</ref> 1849 was the first year of large scale [[cholera]] epidemics in the United States, and thousands are thought to have died along the trail on their way to California\u2014most buried in unmarked graves in Kansas and Nebraska.

Paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships, often heavily subsidized to carry the mail, provided rapid transport to and from the east coast and [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, to and from [[Panama]] to ports in California and Oregon.\n\nOver the years many ferries were established to help get across the many rivers on the path of the Oregon Trail. Multiple ferries were established on the Missouri River, [[Kansas River]], [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]], [[Elkhorn River]], [[Loup River]], Platte River, [[South Platte River]], North Platte River, [[Laramie River]], Green River, [[Bear River (Great Salt Lake)|Bear River]], two crossings of the Snake River, [[John Day River]], [[Deschutes River (Oregon)|Deschutes River]], Columbia River, as well as many other smaller streams. During peak immigration periods several ferries on any given river often competed for pioneer dollars. These ferries significantly increased speed and safety for Oregon Trail travelers. They increased the cost of traveling the trail by roughly $30 per wagon but increased the speed of the transit from about 160 to 170 days in 1843 to 120 to 140 days in 1860. Ferries also helped prevent death by drowning at river crossings.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 410|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1859, an expedition of [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers]] led by Captain [[James H. Simpson]] left Camp Floyd, [[Utah]], to establish an army supply route across the [[Great Basin]] to the eastern slope of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]]. Upon return in early August, Simpson reported that he had surveyed the [[Central Overland Route]] from [[Camp Floyd]] to [[Genoa, Nevada]]. This route went through central Nevada (roughly where [[U.S. Route 50 in Nevada|U.S. Route 50]] goes today) and was about {{convert|280|mi|km}} shorter than the \"standard\" [[Humboldt River]] [[California trail]] route.<ref>{{Cite journal |last = Simpson |first = Capt.

Starting in 1860, the American Civil War closed the heavily subsidized [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] stage Southern Route through the deserts of the American Southwest.\n\nIn 1860\u201361 the [[Pony Express]], employing riders traveling on horseback day and night with relay stations about every {{convert|10|mi|km}} to supply fresh horses, was established from [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], to [[Sacramento, California]]. The Pony Express built many of their eastern stations along the Oregon/California/Mormon/Bozeman trails and many of their western stations along the very sparsely settled [[Central Route]] across Utah and Nevada.<ref name=\"Pony Express\">[http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf Pony Express Trail maps], Retrieved January 28, 2009</ref> The Pony Express delivered mail summer and winter in roughly 10 days from the midwest to California.\n\nIn 1861, [[John Warren Butterfield|John Butterfield]], who since 1858 had been using the Butterfield Overland Mail, also switched to the Central Route to avoid traveling through hostile territories during the American Civil War. [[George Chorpenning]] immediately realized the value of this more direct route, and shifted his existing mail and passenger line along with their stations from the \"Northern Route\" (California Trail) along the Humboldt River. In 1861, the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] also laid its lines alongside the Central Overland Route. Several stage lines were set up carrying mail and passengers that traversed much of the route of the original Oregon Trail to Fort Bridger and from there over the Central Overland Route to California. By traveling day and night with many stations and changes of teams (and extensive mail subsidies), these stages could get passengers and mail from the midwest to California in about 25 to 28 days. These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Oregon Trail and Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the First Transcontinental Telegraph stations and telegraph line, which followed much the same route in 1861 from [[Carson City, Nevada]] to [[Salt Lake City]]. The Pony Express folded in 1861 as they failed to receive an expected mail contract from the U.S. government and the telegraph filled the need for rapid east&ndash;west communication. This combination wagon/stagecoach/pony express/telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref name=\"Pony Express\"/> From Salt Lake City the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon/California/Oregon trails to Omaha, Nebraska.\n\n[[File:Oregon Trail pic.jpg|thumb|left|Covered wagon replica and Mission Monument at the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site]] about ten miles west of Walla Walla, Washington]]\n\nAfter the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, telegraph lines usually followed the railroad tracks as the required relay stations and telegraph lines were much easier to maintain alongside the tracks. Telegraph lines to unpopulated areas were largely abandoned.\n\nAs the years passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used corridor from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots of the trail continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 the population in the states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs to get to their new residences.\n\nEven before the famous Texas [[cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]] after the Civil War, the trail was being used to drive herds of thousands of cattle, horses, sheep, and goats from the midwest to various towns and cities along the trails. According to studies by trail historian John Unruh the livestock may have been as plentiful or more plentiful than the immigrants in many years.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hM2_IXMY3jQC&vq |title = The Plains Across the Overland Emigrants and Trans-Mississippi West 1840\u20131860 |last = Unruh |first = John D |publisher = University of Illinois Press |year = 1993 |isbn = 978-0-252-06360-2 |location =  |pages = 392, 512 |ref = harv }}</ref> In 1852, there were even records of a 1,500-turkey drive from Illinois to California.<ref>Barry, Louise. ''The Beginnings of the West''. 1972. pp 1084\u201385</ref> The main reason for this livestock traffic was the large cost discrepancy between livestock in the midwest and at the end of the trail in California, Oregon, or Montana. They could often be bought in the midwest for about 1/3 to 1/10 what they would fetch at the end of the trail. Large losses could occur and the drovers would still make significant profit. As the emigrant travel on the trail declined in later years and after livestock ranches were established at many places along the trail large herds of animals often were driven along part of the trail to get to and from markets.\n\n=== Trail decline ===\nThe first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, providing faster, safer, and usually cheaper travel east and west (the journey took seven days and cost as little as $65, or $1189.39 in 2016 dollars).<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |title = Railroad ticket 1870 Transcontinental Railroad Statistics |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624020241/http://www.shmoop.com/did-you-know/history/us/transcontinental-railroad/statistics.html |archive-date = June 24, 2009 |url-status =  |access-date = January 21, 2009 }}</ref> Some emigrants continued to use the trail well into the 1890s, and modern highways and railroads eventually paralleled large portions of the trail, including [[U.S. Highway 26]], [[Interstate 84 (west)|Interstate 84]] in Oregon and Idaho and [[Interstate 80]] in Nebraska. Contemporary interest in the overland trek has prompted the states and federal government to preserve landmarks on the trail including wagon ruts, buildings, and \"registers\" where emigrants carved their names. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries there have been a number of re-enactments of the trek with participants wearing period garments and traveling by wagon.\n\n== Routes ==\n[[File:South pass marker2.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trail pioneer [[Ezra Meeker]] erected this boulder near [[Pacific Creek (Sweetwater County, Wyoming)|Pacific Springs]] on Wyoming's [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in 1906.<ref>''Ventures and Adventures of Ezra Meeker: Or, Sixty Years of Frontier Life'' by Ezra Meeker. Rainer Printing Company 1908. ASIN: B000861WA8</ref>]]\n\nAs the trail developed it became marked by many cutoffs and shortcuts from Missouri to Oregon. The basic route follows river valleys as grass and water were absolutely necessary.\n\nWhile the first few parties organized and departed from Elm Grove, the Oregon Trail's primary starting point was [[Independence, Missouri]], or [[Westport, Kansas City, Missouri|Westport]], (which was annexed into modern day [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]), on the Missouri River. Later, several feeder trails led across Kansas, and some towns became starting points, including [[Weston, Missouri|Weston]], [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|Fort Leavenworth]], [[Atchison, Kansas|Atchison]], St. Joseph, and Omaha.\n\nThe Oregon Trail's nominal termination point was [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], at the time the proposed capital of the [[Oregon Territory]]. However, many settlers branched off or stopped short of this goal and settled at convenient or promising locations along the trail. Commerce with pioneers going further west helped establish these early settlements and launched local economies critical to their prosperity.\n\nAt dangerous or difficult river crossings, ferries or toll bridges were set up and bad places on the trail were either repaired or bypassed. Several toll roads were constructed. Gradually the trail became easier with the average trip (as recorded in numerous diaries) dropping from about 160 days in 1849 to 140 days 10 years later.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nMany other trails followed the Oregon Trail for much of its length, including the Mormon Trail from Illinois to Utah; the California Trail to the gold fields of [[California]]; and the Bozeman Trail to [[Montana]]. Because it was more a network of trails than a single trail, there were numerous variations with other trails eventually established on both sides of the Platte, North Platte, Snake, and Columbia rivers. With literally thousands of people and thousands of livestock traveling in a fairly small time slot the travelers had to spread out to find clean water, wood, good campsites, and grass. The dust kicked up by the many travelers was a constant complaint, and where the terrain would allow it there may have been between 20 and 50 wagons traveling abreast.\n\nRemnants of the trail in Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon have been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and the entire trail is a designated [[National Historic Trail]].\n\n=== Missouri ===\nInitially, the main \"jumping off point\" was the common head of the [[Santa Fe Trail]] and Oregon trail&mdash;Independence, and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]. Travelers starting in Independence had to ferry across the Missouri River. After following the Santa Fe trail to near present-day [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], they ferried across the Kansas River to start the trek across [[Kansas]] and points west. Another busy \"jumping off point\" was [[St. Joseph, Missouri|St. Joseph]]\u2014established in 1843.<ref name=\"travel\">{{cite web |url = http://north-america.traveltoworld.com/north-america-travel-guide/5317/saint-peters-missouri/ |title = Saint Peters: Missouri |accessdate = August 30, 2007 |publisher = North America Travel Guide |author = North America Travel Guide }}</ref> In its early days, St. Joseph was a bustling outpost and rough frontier town, serving as one of the last supply points before heading over the Missouri River to the frontier. St. Joseph had good steamboat connections to St. Louis and other ports on the combined [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[Missouri River|Missouri]], and Mississippi River systems. During the busy season there were several ferry boats and steamboats available to transport travelers to the Kansas shore where they started their travels westward. Before the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] was started in 1865, St. Joseph was the westernmost point in the United States accessible by rail. Other towns used as supply points in Missouri included Old Franklin, [[Arrow Rock, Missouri|Arrow Rock]], and [[Fort Osage]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.santafetrailresearch.com/spacepix/franklin-mo.html |title = Franklin Missouri The Beginning of the Santa Fe Trail |last = Larry and Carolyn |date =  |website = www.santafetrailresearch.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== Iowa ===\n{{verbosity|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Bison Bull in Nebraska.jpg|thumb|A bison bull on a [[Nebraska]] wildlife refuge]]\n\nIn 1803, President Thomas Jefferson obtained from France the [[Louisiana Purchase]] for $15&nbsp;million (equivalent to about $230&nbsp;million today) which included all the land drained by the Missouri River and roughly doubled the size of U.S. territory. The future states of Iowa and Missouri, located west of the Mississippi River and east of Missouri River, were part of this purchase. The [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] stopped several times in the future state of Iowa on their 1805\u20131806 expedition to the west coast. A disputed 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] (future ninth President of the U.S.) that surrendered much of the future state of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many [[Sauk people|Sauk]] (Sac) natives and led to the 1832 [[Black Hawk War]]. As punishment for the uprising, and as part of a larger settlement strategy, treaties were subsequently designed to remove all Native Americans from [[Iowa Territory]]. Some settlers started drifting into Iowa in 1833. President [[Martin Van Buren]] on July 4, 1838, signed the U.S. Congress laws establishing the Territory of Iowa. Iowa was located opposite the junction of the Platte and Missouri rivers and was used by some of the [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous|fur trapper rendezvous]] traders as a starting point for their supply expeditions. In 1846 the [[Mormons]], expelled from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], traversed Iowa (on part of the Mormon Trail) and settled temporarily in significant numbers on the Missouri River in Iowa and the future state of Nebraska at their [[Winter Quarters (North Omaha, Nebraska)|Winter Quarters]] near the future city of Omaha, Nebraska.

For those travelers to Oregon, California, and Utah who were bringing their teams to the Platte River junction Kanesville and other towns became major \"jumping off places\" and supply points. In 1847 the Mormons established three ferries across the Missouri River and others established even more ferries for the spring start on the trail. In the 1850 census there were about 8,000 mostly Mormons tabulated in the large [[Pottawattamie County, Iowa]] District 21. (The original Pottawattamie County was subsequently made into five counties and parts of several more.) By 1854 most of the Mormon towns, farms and villages were largely taken over by non-Mormons as they abandoned them or sold them for not much and continued their migration to Utah. After 1846 the towns of Council Bluffs, Iowa, Omaha (est. 1852) and other Missouri River towns became major supply points and \"jumping off places\" for travelers on the Mormon, California, Oregon, and other trails west.\n\n=== Kansas ===\n[[File:Ks rivers.png|thumb|Map of principal rivers in Kansas]]\n\nStarting initially in Independence, Missouri, or [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in Missouri, the initial trail follows the Santa Fe Trail into Kansas south of the [[Wakarusa River]]. After crossing [[Mount Oread]] at [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], the trail crosses the Kansas River by [[ferry]] or boats near Topeka and crossed the Wakarusa and Black Vermillion rivers by ferries.  West of Topeka, the route paralleled what is now [[U.S. Route 24 in Kansas|U.S. Route 24]] until west of St. Mary's. After the Black Vermillion River the trail angles northwest to Nebraska paralleling the [[Little Blue River (Kansas/Nebraska)|Little Blue River]] until reaching the south side of the Platte River.  Destinations along the Oregon Trail in Kansas included [[St. Mary's Mission (Kansas)|St. Mary's Mission]], [[Pottawatomie Indian Pay Station]], [[Louisville, Kansas#Oregon Trail crossing|Vieux's Vermilion Crossing]], [[Alcove Springs]] and [[Hollenberg Pony Express Station|Hollenberg Station]]. Travel by wagon over the gently rolling Kansas countryside was usually unimpeded except where streams had cut steep banks. There a passage could be made with a lot of shovel work to cut down the banks or the travelers could find an already established crossing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== Nebraska ===\n{{see also|California Hill|O'Fallons Bluff}}\n[[File:Chimney Rock NE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock, Nebraska]]]]\n\nThose emigrants on the eastern side of the Missouri River in Missouri or Iowa used ferries and steamboats (fitted out for ferry duty) to cross into towns in Nebraska. Several towns in Nebraska were used as ''jumping off places'' with Omaha eventually becoming a favorite after about 1855. [[Fort Kearny]] (est. 1848) is about {{convert|200|mi|km}} from the Missouri River, and the trail and its many offshoots nearly all converged close to Fort Kearny as they followed the Platte River west. The army maintained fort was the first chance on the trail to buy emergency supplies, do repairs, get medical aid, or mail a letter. Those on the north side of the Platte could usually wade the shallow river if they needed to visit the fort.\n\n[[File:Platterivermap.png|thumb|Map showing the Platte River watershed, including the North Platte and South Platte tributaries]]\n\nThe Platte River and the North Platte River in the future states of Nebraska and Wyoming typically had many channels and islands and were too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for travel even by canoe. The Platte as it pursued its braided paths to the Missouri River was \"too thin to plow and too thick to drink\". While unusable for transportation, the Platte River and North Platte River valleys provided an easily passable wagon corridor going almost due west with access to water, grass, buffalo, and [[cow dung|buffalo chip]]s for fuel.<ref>Mattes, Merrill J. ''The Great Platte River Road''. Bison Books, 1987. {{ISBN|978-0-8032-8153-0}}</ref> The trails gradually got rougher as it progressed up the North Platte. There were trails on both sides of the muddy rivers. The Platte was about {{convert|1|mi|km}} wide and {{convert|2|to|60|in|cm}} deep. The water was silty and bad tasting but it could be used if no other water was available. Letting it sit in a bucket for an hour or so or stirring in a 1/4 cup of cornmeal allowed most of the silt to settle out.\n\nIn the spring in Nebraska and Wyoming the travelers often encountered fierce wind, rain and lightning storms. Until about 1870 travelers encountered hundreds of thousands of [[bison]] migrating through Nebraska on both sides of the Platte River, and most travelers killed several for fresh meat and to build up their supplies of dried [[Jerky (food)|jerky]] for the rest of the journey. The prairie grass in many places was several feet high with only the hat of a traveler on horseback showing as they passed through the prairie grass. In many years the Native Americans fired much of the dry grass on the prairie every fall so the only trees or bushes available for firewood were on islands in the Platte River. Travelers gathered and ignited dried cow dung to cook their meals. These burned fast in a breeze, and it could take two or more bushels of chips to get one meal prepared. Those traveling south of the Platte crossed the South Platte fork at one of about three ferries (in dry years it could be forded without a ferry) before continuing up the North Platte River Valley into present-day Wyoming heading to Fort Laramie. Before 1852 those on the north side of the Platte crossed the North Platte to the south side at Fort Laramie. After 1852 they used Child's Cutoff to stay on the north side to about the present day town of [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]], Wyoming, where they crossed over to the south side.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.globalclassroom.org/nebraska.html |title = The Oregon Trail in Western Nebraska |website = www.globalclassroom.org |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNotable landmarks in Nebraska include [[Courthouse and Jail Rocks]], [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]], [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]], and [[Ash Hollow State Historical Park|Ash Hollow]] with its steep descent down [[Windlass Hill]] over the South Platte.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://gnelson.incolor.com/neocta.html |title = NE - OCTA Home Page |last = Nelson |first = Greg |website = gnelson.incolor.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nToday much of the Oregon Trail follows roughly along Interstate 80 from Wyoming to [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], Nebraska. From there [[U.S. Highway 30]] which follows the Platte River is a better approximate path for those traveling the north side of the Platte. The National Park Service (NPS) gives traveling advice for those who want to follow other branches of the trail.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/oreg/planyourvisit/upload/NE_ATRIG_Web.pdf Oregon Trail Nebraska eastern Wyoming] NPS road guide, accessed February 8, 2010</ref>\n\n==== Cholera on the Platte River ====\nBecause of the Platte's brackish water, the preferred camping spots were along one of the many fresh water streams draining into the Platte or the occasional fresh water spring found along the way. These preferred camping spots became sources of cholera in the epidemic years (1849\u20131855) as many thousands of people used the same camping spots with essentially no sewage facilities or adequate sewage treatment. One of the side effects of cholera is acute diarrhea, which helps contaminate even more water unless it is isolated and/or treated. The cause of cholera (ingesting the ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' bacterium from contaminated water) and the best treatment for cholera infections were unknown in this era. Thousands of travelers on the combined California, Oregon, and Mormon trails succumbed to cholera between 1849 and 1855. Most were buried in unmarked graves in Kansas, Nebraska and Wyoming. Although also considered part of the [[Mormon Trail]], the grave of [[Rebecca Winters (pioneer)|Rebecca Winters]] is one of the few marked ones left. There are many cases cited involving people who were alive and apparently healthy in the morning and dead by nightfall.\n\n=== Colorado ===\nA branch of the Oregon trail crossed the very northeast corner of [[Colorado]] if they followed the South Platte River to one of its last crossings. This branch of the trail passed through present day [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] before entering Wyoming. Later settlers followed the Platte and South Platte Rivers into their settlements there (much of which became the state of Colorado).\n\n=== Wyoming ===\n{{Main|Emigrant Trail in Wyoming}}\n\nAfter crossing the South Platte River the Oregon Trail follows the North Platte River out of Nebraska into Wyoming. [[Fort Laramie National Historic Site|Fort Laramie]], at the confluence of the Laramie and North Platte rivers, was a major stopping point. Fort Laramie was a former fur trading outpost originally named Fort John that was purchased in 1848 by the U.S. Army to protect travelers on the trails.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |title = Chronological List of Fort Laramie History |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081121161424/http://www.nps.gov/archive/fola/chrono.htm |archivedate = November 21, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> It was the last army outpost till travelers reached the coast.\n\nFort Laramie was the end of most cholera outbreaks which killed thousands along the lower Platte and North Platte from 1849 to 1855. Spread by cholera bacteria in fecal contaminated water, cholera caused massive diarrhea, leading to dehydration and death. In those days its cause and treatment were unknown, and it was often fatal\u2014up to 30&nbsp;percent of infected people died. It is believed that the swifter flowing rivers in Wyoming helped prevent the germs from spreading.<ref>\"Treading the Elephant's Tail: Medical Problems on the Overland Trails\".

As the North Platte veers to the south, the trail crosses the North Platte to the Sweetwater River Valley, which heads almost due west. [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]] is on the Sweetwater River. The Sweetwater would have to be crossed up to nine times before the trail crosses over the [[Continental Divide]] at South Pass, Wyoming. From South Pass the trail continues southwest crossing [[Big Sandy River (Wyoming)|Big Sandy Creek]]&mdash;about {{convert|10|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|1|foot}} deep&mdash;before hitting the Green River. Three to five ferries were in use on the Green during peak travel periods. The deep, wide, swift, and treacherous Green River which eventually empties into the Colorado River, was usually at high water in July and August, and it was a dangerous crossing. After crossing the Green, the main trail continued approximately southwest until the [[Blacks Fork]] of the Green River and Fort Bridger. From Fort Bridger the Mormon Trail continued southwest following the upgraded [[Hastings Cutoff]] through the [[Wasatch Mountains]].<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://scienceviews.com/historical/hastingsintro.html |title = The Hastings Cutoff Introduction |website = scienceviews.com |access-date = October 13, 2017 }}</ref> From Fort Bridger, the main trail, comprising several variants, veered northwest over the Bear River Divide and descended to the Bear River Valley.

The traffic in later years is undocumented.\n\nThe Lander Road departs the main trail at Burnt Ranch near South Pass, crosses the Continental Divide north of South Pass and reaches the Green River near the present town of Big Piney, Wyoming. From there the trail followed Big Piney Creek west before passing over the {{convert|8800|ft|m}} Thompson Pass in the [[Wyoming Range]]. It then crosses over the Smith Fork of the Bear River before ascending and crossing another {{convert|8200|ft|m|adj=on}} pass on the [[Salt River Range]] of mountains and then descending into [[Star Valley]]. It exited the mountains near the present Smith Fork road about {{convert|6|mi|km}} south of the town of [[Smoot, Wyoming|Smoot]]. The road continued almost due north along the present day Wyoming&ndash;Idaho western border through Star Valley. To avoid crossing the [[Salt River (Wyoming)|Salt River]] (which drains into the Snake River) which runs down Star Valley the Lander Road crossed the river when it was small and stayed west of the Salt River.

This cutoff rejoined the Oregon and California Trails near the City of Rocks near the Utah&ndash;Idaho border and could be used by both California and Oregon bound travelers. Located about half way on both the California and Oregon trails many thousands of later travelers used Salt Lake City and other Utah cities as an intermediate stop for selling or trading excess goods or tired livestock for fresh livestock, repairs, supplies or fresh vegetables. The Mormons looked on these travelers as a welcome bonanza as setting up new communities from scratch required nearly everything the travelers could afford to part with. The overall distance to California or Oregon was very close to the same whether one \"detoured\" to Salt Lake City or not. For their own use and to encourage California and Oregon bound travelers the Mormons improved the Mormon Trail from Fort Bridger and the Salt Lake Cutoff trail. To raise much needed money and facilitate travel on the Salt Lake Cutoff they set up several ferries across the [[Weber River|Weber]], Bear, and [[Malad River (Gooding County, Idaho)|Malad]] rivers, which were used mostly by travelers bound for Oregon or California.\n\n=== Idaho ===\n{{seealso|Oregon Trail (Ada County, Idaho segment)}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|2=section|date=September 2018}}\nThe main Oregon and California Trail went almost due north from Fort Bridger to the Little Muddy Creek where it passed over the Bear River Mountains to the Bear River Valley, which it followed northwest into the Thomas Fork area, where the trail crossed over the present day Wyoming line into Idaho. In the Eastern Sheep Creek Hills in the Thomas Fork valley the emigrants encountered Big Hill. Big Hill was a detour caused by a then-impassable cut the Bear River made through the mountains and had a tough ascent often requiring doubling up of teams and a very steep and dangerous descent.<ref>[http://www.idahohistory.net/OTbighill.html Big Hill Idaho].

Fort Hall was an old fur trading post located on the Snake River. It was established in 1832 by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth and company and later sold in 1837 to the Hudson's Bay Company. At Fort Hall nearly all travelers were given some aid and supplies if they were available and needed. Mosquitoes were constant pests, and travelers often mention that their animals were covered with blood from the bites.

Two of these fords were near Fort Hall, where travelers on the Oregon Trail North Side Alternate (established about 1852) and Goodale's Cutoff (established 1862) crossed the Snake to travel on the north side. Nathaniel Wyeth, the original founder of Fort Hall in 1834, writes in his diary that they found a ford across the Snake River {{convert|4|mi|km}} southwest of where he founded Fort Hall.

This cutoff had been used as a pack trail by Native Americans and fur traders, and emigrant wagons traversed parts of the eastern section as early as 1852. After crossing the Snake River the {{convert|230|mi|km|adj=on}} cutoff headed north from Fort Hall toward Big Southern Butte following the [[Big Lost River|Lost River]] part of the way. It passed near the present-day town of [[Arco, Idaho]], and wound through the northern part of what is now [[Craters of the Moon National Monument]]. From there it went southwest to [[Camas Prairie]] and ended at [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834-54)|Old Fort Boise]] on the [[Boise River]]. This journey typically took two to three weeks and was noted for its very rough lava terrain and extremely dry climate, which tended to dry the wooden wheels on the wagons, causing the iron rims to fall off the wheels. Loss of wheels caused many wagons to be abandoned along the route. It rejoined the main trail east of Boise. Goodale's Cutoff is visible at many points along [[U.S. Highway 20|US-20]], [[U.S. Highway 26|US-26]], and [[U.S. Highway 93|US-93]] between Craters of the Moon National Monument and [[Carey, Idaho|Carey]].<ref>Goodale's Cutoff NPS [http://www.nps.gov/archive/crmo/goodale.htm] Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\n[[File:Shoshone Falls, Snake River, Idaho ppmsca.10072u.jpg|thumb|View across top of [[Shoshone Falls]], [[Snake River]], Idaho ([[Timothy H.

The crossings were doubly treacherous because there were often hidden holes in the river bottom which could overturn the wagon or entangle the team, sometimes with fatal consequences. Before ferries were established there were several drownings here nearly every year.<ref>[http://www.stateparks.com/three_island_crossing.html Three Mile Island Crossing Park], Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\nThe north side of the Snake had better water and grass than the south. The trail from Three Island Crossing to Old Fort Boise was about {{convert|130|mi|km}} long. The usually lush Boise River Valley was a welcome relief. The next crossing of the Snake River was near Old Fort Boise. This last crossing of the Snake could be done on bull boats while swimming the stock across. Others would chain a large string of wagons and teams together. The theory was that the front teams, usually oxen, would get out of water first and with good footing help pull the whole string of wagons and teams across. How well this worked in practice is not stated. Often young Native American boys were hired to drive and ride the stock across the river\u2014they knew how to swim, unlike many pioneers. In present-day Idaho, [[Interstate 84 (west)|I-84]] roughly follows the Oregon Trail from the Idaho-Oregon State border at the Snake River.

It bypassed the Three Island Crossing and continued traveling down the south side of the Snake River. It rejoined the trail near present-day [[Ontario, Oregon]]. It hugged the southern edge of the Snake River canyon and was a much rougher trail with poorer water and grass, requiring occasional steep descents and ascents with the animals down into the Snake River canyon to get water.

The trail then went to the [[Malheur River]] and then past [[Farewell Bend State Recreation Area|Farewell Bend]] on the Snake River, up the [[Burnt River (Oregon)|Burnt River]] canyon and northwest to the Grande Ronde Valley near present-day [[La Grande, Oregon|La Grande]] before coming to the Blue Mountains. In 1843 settlers cut a wagon road over these mountains making them passable for the first time to wagons. The trail went to the [[Whitman Mission]] near Fort Nez Perces in Washington until 1847 when the [[Whitman massacre|Whitmans were killed by Native Americans]]. At Fort Nez Perce some built rafts or hired boats and started down the Columbia; others continued west in their wagons until they reached The Dalles. After 1847 the trail bypassed the closed mission and headed almost due west to present day [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], Oregon, crossing the [[Umatilla River]], John Day River, and Deschutes River before arriving at The Dalles. Interstate 84 in Oregon roughly follows the original Oregon Trail from Idaho to The Dalles.\n\nArriving at the Columbia at The Dalles and stopped by the [[Cascade Mountains]] and Mount Hood, some gave up their wagons or disassembled them and put them on boats or rafts for a trip down the Columbia River. Once they transited the Cascade's [[Columbia River Gorge]] with its multiple rapids and treacherous winds they would have to make the {{convert|1.6|mi|km|adj=on}} portage around the [[Cascade Rapids]] before coming out near the [[Willamette River]] where Oregon City was located. The pioneer's livestock could be driven around Mount Hood on the narrow, crooked and rough Lolo Pass.\n\nSeveral Oregon Trail branches and route variations led to the Willamette Valley. The most popular was the Barlow Road, which was carved though the forest around Mount Hood from The Dalles in 1846 as a toll road at $5 per wagon and 10 cents per head of livestock. It was rough and steep with poor grass but still cheaper and safer than floating goods, wagons and family down the dangerous Columbia River.\n\nIn Central Oregon, there was the [[Santiam Wagon Road]] (established 1861), which roughly parallels Oregon Highway 20 to the Willamette Valley. The [[Applegate Trail]] (established 1846), cutting off the California Trail from the Humboldt River in Nevada, crossed part of California before cutting north to the south end of the Willamette Valley. [[U.S. Route 99]] and [[Interstate 5]] through Oregon roughly follow the original Applegate Trail.\n\n== Travel equipment ==\n=== Wagons and pack animals===\nThree types of [[Working animal|draft]] and [[pack animal]]s were used by Oregon Trail pioneers: [[oxen]], [[mule]]s, and [[horse]]s.<ref name=\"Dary\">David Dary, ''The Oregon Trail: An American Saga'' (Knopt, 2004), pp. 79-80.</ref>\n\nBy 1842, many emigrants favored oxen&mdash;castrated bulls (males) of the genus ''[[Bos]]'' (cattle), generally over four years old&mdash;as the best animal to pull wagons, because they were docile, generally healthy, and able to continue moving in difficult conditions such as mud and snow.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen could also survive on [[Tallgrass prairie|prairie grasses]] and [[Artemisia tridentata|sage]], unlike horses, who had to be fed. Moreover, oxen were less expensive to purchase and maintain than horses.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen also could stand idle for long periods without suffering damage to the feet and legs.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Oxen were trained by leading, the use of a [[whip]] or [[goad]], and the use of oral commands (such as \"[[Gee and haw|Gee]]\" (right), \"[[Gee and haw|Haw]]\" (left), and \"Whoa\" (stop)).<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Two oxen were typically yoked together at the neck or head; the left ox was referred to as the \"near\" or \"nigh\" ox, and the right ox as the \"off\" ox.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> While no [[rein]]s, [[Bit (horse)|bits]], or [[halter]]s were needed, the trainer had to be forceful. Oxen typically traveled at a steady pace up to two miles an hour.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>\n\nOne drawback of oxen was the difficulty of shoeing. Oxen hooves are [[Cloven hoof|cloven]] (split), and they had to be shod with two curved pieces of metal, one on each side of the hoof. While horses and mules allowed themselves to be shod relatively easily, the process was more difficult with oxen, which would lie down and tuck their feet under themselves.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>  As a result, several men had to lift and hold an ox while he was being shod.<ref name=\"Dary\"/>\n\nMules were used by some emigrants.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> The competing merits of oxen and mules were hotly debated among emigrants.<ref name=\"Stamm\">Mike Stamm, ''The Mule Alternative: The Saddle Mule in the American West'' (1992), p. 61-62.</ref> Some found oxen to be more durable.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Others, by contrast, believed that mules were more durable, and mules may have had a lower attrition rate on the trail than oxen.<ref name=\"Stamm\"/> Like oxen, mules could survive on prairie grasses.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Mules were, however, notoriously ill-tempered.<ref name=\"Dary\"/> Mules also cost about three times as much as oxen, a deciding factor for many emigrants.<ref name=\"Stamm\"/><ref>George R. Stewart, ''The California Trail: An Epic with Many Heroes'' (1962), p. 40.</ref>\n\nThree types of wagons were pulled:\n\n* [[Conestoga wagon]]s, a heavy type of covered wagon \n* [[Covered wagon]] (\"prairie schooners\"), lighter than a Conestoga and often just a covered farm wagon.\n* Studebaker (see [[Studebaker#History|\u00a7 History]])\n\n=== Food ===\nThe typical cost of food for four people for six months was about $150.{{when|date=March 2016}}<ref>{{cite book |author = Dary, David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

T. H. Jefferson, in his ''Brief Practice Advice'' guidebook for migrants, recommended that each adult take 200 pounds of flour: \"Take plenty of bread stuff; this is the staff of life when everything else runs short.\"<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nFood often took the form of [[cracker (food)|crackers]] or [[hardtack]]; Southerners sometimes chose [[cornmeal]] or [[pinole]] rather than [[wheat]] flour.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  Emigrants typically ate [[rice]] and [[bean]]s only at forts stopped at along the way, because boiling water was difficult on the trail, and fuel was not abundant.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> [[Lansford Hastings]] recommended that each emigrant take 200 pounds of [[flour]], 150 pounds of \"[[bacon]]\" (a word which, at the time, referred broadly to all forms of [[salt pork]]), 20 pounds of [[sugar]], and 10 pounds of [[salt]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/> [[Chipped beef]], rice, tea, dried beans, [[dried fruit]], [[saleratus]] (for raising bread), [[vinegar]], [[pickled cucumber|pickles]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[tallow]] might also be taken.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/>  Joseph Ware's 1849 guide recommends that travelers take for each individual a barrel of flour or 180 pounds of ship's biscuit (i.e., hardtack), 150\u2013180 pounds of bacon, 60 pounds of beans or [[pea]]s, 25 pounds of [[rice]], 25 pounds of [[coffee]], 40 pounds of sugar, a keg of lard, 30 or 40 pounds of [[dried fruit]] ([[peach]]es or [[apple]]s), a keg of clear, [[Rendering (animal products)|rendered]] beef [[suet]] (to substitute for butter), as well as some [[vinegar]], salt, and [[Black pepper|pepper]].<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Many emigrant families also carried a small amount of [[tea]] and [[maple sugar]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\n[[Randolph B. Marcy]], an Army officer who wrote an 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended. He advised emigrants to drive cattle instead as a source of fresh beef.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Marcy also instructed emigrants to store sides of bacon in canvas bags or in boxes surrounded by [[bran]] to protect against extreme heat, which could make bacon [[Rancidification|go rancid]].<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy instructed emigrants to put salt pork on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy also recommended the use of [[pemmican]], as well as the storage of sugar in [[India-rubber]] or [[gutta-percha]] sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\n[[Canning]] technology had just begun to be developed, and it gained in popularity through the period of westward expansion. Initially, only upper-class migrants typically used canned goods.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> There are references in sources to canned cheese, fruit, meat, [[oyster]]s, and [[sardine]]s.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> By the time Marcy wrote his 1859 guide, canned foods were increasingly available but remained expensive. Canning also added weight to a wagon. Rather than canned vegetables, Marcy suggested that travelers take dried vegetables, which had been used in the [[Crimean War]] and by the U.S. Army.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nSome pioneers took eggs and butter packed in barrels of flour, and some took [[dairy cow]]s along the trail.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> [[Hunting]] provided another source of food along the trail; pioneers hunted [[American bison]] as well as [[pronghorn antelope]], [[Odocoileus|deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], and wildfowl.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> From rivers and lakes, emigrants also fished for [[catfish]] and [[trout]].<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> When emigrants faced starvation, they would sometimes slaughter their animals (horses, mules, and oxen).<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  In desperate times, migrants would search for less-popular sources of food, including [[coyote]], [[fox]], [[jackrabbit]], [[marmot]], [[prairie dog]], and [[rattlesnake]] (nicknamed \"bush fish\" in the later period).<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\nAt the time, [[scurvy]] was well-recognized, but there was a lack of clear understanding of how to prevent the disease.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Nevertheless, pioneers' consumption of the wild [[berry|berries]] (including [[chokeberry]], [[gooseberry]], and [[serviceberry]]) and [[Ribes|currants]] that grew along the trail (particularly along the [[Platte River]]) helped make scurvy infrequent.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/><ref name=\"Horsman\"/> Marcy's guide correctly suggested that the consumption of wild grapes, greens, and onions could help prevent the disease and that if vegetables were not available, [[citric acid]] could be drunk with sugar and water.<ref name=\"Horsman\"/>\n\nEmigrant families, who were mostly middle-class, prided themselves on preparing a good table. Although operating [[Dutch oven]]s and kneading dough was difficult on the trail, many baked good bread and even pies.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\nFor fuel to heat food, travelers would collect [[cedar wood]], [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]], or [[willow]] wood, when available, and sometimes dry prairie grass.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> More frequently, however, travelers relied on \"[[cow dung|buffalo chips]]\"\u2014dried bison dung\u2014to fuel fires.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Buffalo chips resembled rotten wood and would make clear and hot fires.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> Chips burned quickly, however, and it took up to three [[bushel]]s of chips to heat a single meal.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>  Collecting buffalo chips was a common task for children and was one chore that even very young children could carry out.<ref name=\"McLynn\"/> As a result, \"memoirs written by those who were very young when they made the journey west invariably refer to this aspect of life on the trail.\"<ref name=\"McLynn\"/>\n\n=== Clothing, equipment and supplies ===\nTobacco was popular, both for personal use, and for trading with natives and other pioneers. Each person brought at least two changes of clothes and multiple pairs of boots (two to three pairs often wore out on the trip). About 25 pounds of soap was recommended for a party of four, for bathing and washing clothes. A washboard and tub were usually brought for washing clothes. Wash days typically occurred once or twice a month, or less, depending on availability of good grass, water, and fuel.\n\nMost wagons carried tents for sleeping, though in good weather most would sleep outside. A thin fold-up mattress, blankets, pillows, canvas, or rubber gutta percha ground covers were used for sleeping. Sometimes an unfolded feather bed mattress was brought for the wagon, if there were pregnant women or very young children along. Storage boxes were ideally the same height, so they could be arranged to give a flat surface inside the wagon for a sleeping platform.\n\nThe wagons had no springs, and the ride along the trail was very rough. Despite modern depictions, hardly anyone actually rode in the wagons; it was too dusty, too rough, and too hard on the livestock.\n\n[[File:Bierstadt Albert Oregon Trail.jpg|thumb|''Oregon Trail'', painting by [[Albert Bierstadt]], c. 1863]]\n\nTravelers brought books, Bibles, trail guides, and writing quills, ink, and paper for writing letters or journalling (about one in 200 kept a diary).<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 4\u20135|ps=.}}</ref>\n\nA belt and folding knives were carried by nearly all men and boys. Awls, scissors, pins, needles, and thread for mending were required. Spare leather was used for repairing shoes, harnesses, and other equipment. Some used goggles to keep dust out of the eyes.\n\nSaddles, bridles, hobbles, and ropes were needed if the party had a horse or riding mule, and many men did. Extra harnesses and spare wagon parts were often carried. Most carried steel shoes for horses, mules, or livestock. Tar was carried to help repair an ox's injured hoof.\n\nGoods, supplies, and equipment were often shared by fellow travelers.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149\u2013155|ps=.}}</ref> Items that were forgotten, broken, or worn out could be bought from a fellow traveler, post, or fort along the way. New iron shoes for horses, mules, and oxen were put on by blacksmiths found along the way. Equipment repairs and other goods could be procured from blacksmith shops established at some forts and some ferries. Emergency supplies, repairs, and livestock were often provided by local residents in California, Oregon, and Utah for late travelers on the trail who were hurrying to beat the snow.\n\nNon-essential items were often abandoned to lighten the load, or in case of emergency. Many travelers would salvage discarded items, picking up essentials or leaving behind their lower quality item when a better one was found abandoned along the road. Some profited by collecting discarded items, hauling them back to jumping off places, and reselling them. In the early years, Mormons sent scavenging parties back along the trail to salvage as much iron and other supplies as possible and haul it to Salt Lake City, where supplies of all kinds were needed.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|pp= 149\u2013150|ps=.}}</ref> Others would use discarded furniture, wagons, and wheels as firewood. During the 1849 gold rush, [[Fort Laramie]] was known as \"Camp Sacrifice\" because of the large amounts merchandise discarded nearby.<ref>{{harvp|Unruh|1993|p= 150|ps=.}}</ref> Travelers had pushed along the relatively easy path to Fort Laramie with their luxury items but discarded them before the difficult mountain crossing ahead, and after discovering that many items could be purchased at the forts or located for free along the way. Some travelers carried their excess goods to Salt Lake City to be sold.\n\nProfessional tools used by blacksmiths, carpenters, and farmers were carried by nearly all. Axes, crow bars, hammers, hatchets, hoes, mallets, mattocks, picks, planes, saws, scythes, and shovels<ref>{{cite web |publisher = Oregon Trail Center |url = http://www.oregontrailcenter.org/HistoricalTrails/Supplies.htm |title = Supplies }}</ref> were used to clear or make a road through brush or trees, cut down the banks to cross a wash or steep banked stream, build a raft or bridge, or repair the wagon. In general, as little road work as possible was done. Travel was often along the top of ridges to avoid the brush and washes common in many valleys.\n\n== Statistics ==\nOverall, some 268,000 pioneers used the Oregon Trail and its three primary offshoots, the [[Bozeman Trail|Bozeman]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Mormon Trail|Mormon]] trails, to reach the West Coast, 1840\u20131860. Another 48,000 headed to Utah.

None of these original statistical records have been found\u2014the Army either lost them or destroyed them. Only some partial written copies of the Army records and notes recorded in several diaries have survived.\n\nEmigration to California spiked considerably with the [[Gold Rush of 1849|1849 gold rush]]. Following the discovery of gold, California remained the destination of choice for most emigrants on the trail up to 1860, with almost 200,000 people traveling there between 1849 and 1860.\n\nTravel diminished after 1860, as the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] caused considerable disruptions on the trail. Many of the people on the trail in 1861\u20131863 were fleeing the war and its attendant drafts in both the south and the north. Trail historian Merrill J. Mattes<ref>Mattes, Merrill J.; op. cit.; p. 23</ref> has estimated the number of emigrants for 1861\u20131867 given in the total column of the above table. But these estimates may well be low since they only amount to an extra 125,000 people, and the 1870 census shows that over 200,000 additional people (ignoring most of the population increase in California, which had excellent sea and rail connections across Panama by then) showed up in all the states served by the Bozeman, California, Mormon, and Oregon Trail(s) and their offshoots.\n\nMormon emigration records after 1860 are reasonably accurate, as newspaper and other accounts in Salt Lake City give most of the names of emigrants arriving each year from 1847 to 1868.<ref name=\"lds.org\"/> Gold and silver strikes in Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon caused a considerable increase in people using the trails, often in directions different from the original trail users.\n\nThough the numbers are significant in the context of the times, far more people chose to remain at home in the 31 states. Between 1840 and 1860, the population of the United States rose by 14&nbsp;million, yet only about 300,000 decided to make the trip. Many were discouraged by the cost, effort and danger of the trip.

Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east to the west and new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails to get to their new homes between 1860 and 1870.\n\n=== Costs ===\nThe cost of traveling over the Oregon Trail and its extensions varied from nothing to a few hundred dollars per person. Women seldom went alone. The cheapest way was to hire on to help drive the wagons or herds, allowing one to make the trip for nearly nothing or even make a small profit. Those with capital could often buy livestock in the [[Midwest]] and drive the stock to California or Oregon for profit. About 60 to 80&nbsp;percent of the travelers were farmers and as such already owned a wagon, livestock team, and many of the necessary supplies. This lowered the cost of the trip to about $50 per person for food and other items. Families planned the trip months in advance and made much of the extra clothing and many other items needed. Individuals buying most of the needed items would end up spending between $150\u2013$200 per person.<ref>{{cite book |last = Dary |first = David |title = The Oregon Trail an American Saga |publisher = Alfred P.

Estimating is difficult because of the common practice of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid their being dug up by animals or natives. Graves were often put in the middle of a trail and then run over by the livestock to make them difficult to find. Disease was the main killer of trail travelers; [[cholera]] killed up to 3 percent of all travelers in the epidemic years from 1849 to 1855.\n\nNative attacks increased significantly after 1860, when most of the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began fanning out all over the country, often encroaching on Native American territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the [[Central Nevada Route]]. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the native trouble nearer the [[Snake River]]. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the [[South Platte]] to avoid local Native American hot spots.\n\nOther common causes of death included [[hypothermia]], drowning in river crossings, getting run over by wagons, and accidental gun deaths. Later, more family groups started traveling, and many more bridges and ferries were being put in, so fording a dangerous river became much less common and dangerous. Surprisingly few people were taught to swim in this era. Being run over was a major cause of death, despite the wagons' only averaging 2\u20133 miles per hour. The wagons could not easily be stopped, and people, particularly children, were often trying to get on and off the wagons while they were moving\u2014not always successfully. Another hazard was a dress getting caught in the wheels and pulling the person under. Accidental shootings declined significantly after Fort Laramie, as people became more familiar with their weapons and often just left them in their wagons. Carrying around a ten-pound rifle all day soon became tedious and usually unnecessary, as the perceived threat of natives faded and hunting opportunities receded.\n\nA significant number of travelers were suffering from [[scurvy]] by the end of their trips. Their typical flour and salted pork/bacon diet had very little [[vitamin C]] in it. The diet in the mining camps was also typically low in fresh vegetables and fruit, which indirectly led to early deaths of many of the inhabitants. Some believe that scurvy deaths may have rivaled cholera as a killer, with most deaths occurring after the victim reached California.<ref>Steele, Volney M.D. ''Bleed, Blister, and Purge: A History of Medicine on the American Frontier''. Mountain Press Publishing Company, 2005. pp 115, 116. {{ISBN|978-0-87842-505-1}}</ref>\n\nMiscellaneous deaths included deaths by childbirth, falling trees, flash floods, homicides, kicks by animals, lightning strikes, snake bites, and stampedes. According to an evaluation by John Unruh,<ref name=unruh1993-408-410,516 /> a 4 percent death rate or 16,000 out of 400,000 total pioneers on all trails may have died on the trail.\n\nReaching the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] before the start of the winter storms was critical for a successful completion of a trip. The most famous failure in that regard was that of the [[Donner Party]], whose members struggled to traverse what is today called [[Donner Pass]], in November 1846. When the last survivor was rescued in April 1847, 33 men, women, and children had died at [[Donner Lake]]; with some of the 48 survivors' confessing to having resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive.<ref>{{harvp|Peters|1996|pp=102-109|ps=.}}</ref>\n\n=== Disease ===\nDisease was the biggest killer on the Oregon Trail.

James Sinclair led a large party of nearly 200 settlers from the Red River Colony in 1841. These northern routes were largely abandoned after Britain ceded its claim to the southern Columbia River basin by way of the Oregon Treaty of 1846.\n\nThe longest trip was the voyage of about {{convert|13600|to|15000|mi|km}} on an uncomfortable sailing ship rounding the treacherous, cold, and dangerous Cape Horn between [[Antarctica]] and South America and then sailing on to California or Oregon. This trip typically took four to seven months (120 to 210 days) and cost about $350 to $500. The cost could be reduced to zero if you signed on as a crewman and worked as a common seaman. The hundreds of abandoned ships, whose crews had deserted in San Francisco Bay in 1849\u201350, showed many thousands chose to do this.\n\nOther routes involved taking a ship to [[Col\u00f3n, Panama]] (then called Aspinwall) and a strenuous, disease ridden, five- to seven-day trip by canoe and mule over the Isthmus of Panama before catching a ship from [[Panama City, Panama]] to Oregon or California. This trip could be done from the east coast theoretically in less than two months if all ship connections were made without waits and typically cost about $450/person. Catching a fatal disease was a distinct possibility as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1852 learned when his unit of about 600 soldiers and some of their dependents traversed the Isthmus and lost about 120 men, women, and children.<ref>Brooks D. Simpson; Ulysses S. Grant: Triumph Over Adversity, 1822\u20131865; 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-395-65994-6}}, pg. 55</ref> This passage was considerably sped up and made safer in 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed at terrible cost in money and life across the Isthmus. The once treacherous {{convert|50|mi|km|adj=on}} trip could be done in less than a day. The time and the cost for transit dropped as regular paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships went from ports on the east coast and New Orleans, Louisiana, to Col\u00f3n, Panama ($80\u2013$100), across the Isthmus of Panama by railroad ($25) and by paddle wheel steamships and sailing ships to ports in California and Oregon ($100\u2013$150).\n\nAnother route was established by [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] across [[Nicaragua]] in 1849. The {{convert|120|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] to the Atlantic Ocean helps drain the {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[Lake Nicaragua]]. From the western shore of Lake Nicaragua it is only about {{convert|12|mi|km}} to the Pacific Ocean. Vanderbilt decided to use paddle wheel steam ships from the U.S. to the San Juan River, small paddle wheel steam launches on the San Juan River, boats across Lake Nicaragua, and a stage coach to the Pacific where connections could be made with another ship headed to California, Oregon, etc.. Vanderbilt, by undercutting fares to the Isthmus of Panama and stealing many of the Panama Railroad workers, managed to attract roughly 30% of the California bound steam boat traffic. All his connections in Nicaragua were never completely worked out before the Panama Railroad's completion in 1855. Civil strife in Nicaragua and a payment to Cornelius Vanderbilt of a \"non-compete\" payment (bribe) of $56,000 per year killed the whole project in 1855.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.costarica-net-guide.com/vanderbilt.html |title = Nicaragua Route }}</ref>\n\nAnother possible route consisted of taking a ship to Mexico traversing the country and then catching another ship out of [[Acapulco, Mexico|Acapulco]], Mexico to California etc. This route was used by some adventurous travelers but was not too popular because of the difficulties of making connections and the often hostile population along the way.\n\nThe Gila Trail going along the [[Gila River]] in [[Arizona]], across the [[Colorado River]] and then across the [[Sonora Desert]] in California was scouted by [[Stephen Kearny]]'s troops and later by Captain [[Philip St. George Cooke]]'s [[Mormon Battalion]] in 1846 who were the first to take a wagon the whole way. This route was used by many gold hungry miners in 1849 and later but suffered from the disadvantage that you had to find a way across the very wide and very dry Sonora Desert. It was used by many in 1849 and later as a winter crossing to California, despite its many disadvantages.\n\nRunning from 1857 to 1861, the Butterfield Stage Line won the $600,000/yr. U.S. mail contract to deliver mail to San Francisco, California. As dictated by southern Congressional members, the {{convert|2800|mi|km|adj=on}} route ran from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri through [[Arkansas]], [[Indian Territory|Oklahoma Indian Territory]], Texas, [[New Mexico Territory]], and across the Sonora Desert before ending in San Francisco, California. Employing over 800 at its peak, it used 250 [[Stagecoach#Concord stagecoaches|Concord Stagecoaches]] seating 12 very crowded passengers in three rows. It used 1,800 head of stock, horses and mules and 139 relay stations to ensure the stages ran day and night. A one way fare of $200 delivered a very thrashed and tired passenger into San Francisco in 25 to 28 days. After traveling the route, ''[[New York Herald]]'' reporter Waterman Ormsby said, \"I now know what Hell is like. I've just had 24 days of it.\"\n\nOther ways to get to Oregon were: using the York Factory Express route across Canada, and down the Columbia River; ships from Hawaii, San Francisco, or other ports that stopped in Oregon; emigrants trailing up from California, etc. All provided a trickle of emigrants, but they were soon overwhelmed in numbers by the emigrants coming over the Oregon Trail.\n\nThe ultimate competitor arrived in 1869, the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], which cut travel time to about seven days at a low fare of about $60 (economy)<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/FAQs.html#Fare Railroad fares 1869] Retrieved February 22, 2009</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nOne of the enduring legacies of the Oregon Trail is the expansion of the United States territory to the West Coast. Without the many thousands of United States settlers in Oregon and California, and thousands more on their way each year, it is highly unlikely that this would have occurred.\n\n[[File:Conestoga wagon on Oregon Trail - NARA - 286056 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|Oregon Trail reenactment at [[Scotts Bluff National Monument|Scotts Bluff]]]]\n\n===Arts, entertainment, and media===\nThe western expansion, and the Oregon Trail in particular, inspired numerous creative works about the settlers' experiences.\n\n====Commemorative coin====\nThe [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]] was coined to commemorate the route. Issued intermittently between 1926 and 1939, 202,928 were sold to the public. With 131,050 minted in 1926, that year's issue remains readily available for collectors.\n\n====Games====\nThe story of the Oregon Trail inspired the educational video game series ''[[The Oregon Trail (series)|The Oregon Trail]]'', which became widely popular in the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\n====Television====\n''[[The Oregon Trail (TV series)|The Oregon Trail]]'' was a television series that ran from September 22 through October 26, 1977, on NBC.

Crespo scored just once before the season's end, against [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]]. The striker enjoyed a more successful [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]], scoring 11 goals. In doing so, he became Parma's top scorer for a fourth time, which remains a post-war club record.

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.\n\nDue to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General [[Eloy Alfaro]].

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]]. This land contains most of Ecuador's volcanoes and all of its snow-capped peaks. Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]]. The largest Sierran city is [[Quito]].\n* '''La Amazon\u00eda''', also known as ''El Oriente'', or \"the east\": The oriente consists of the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon jungle]] provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Morona Santiago Province|Morona Santiago]], [[Napo Province|Napo]], [[Orellana Province|Orellana]], [[Pastaza Province|Pastaza]], [[Sucumb\u00edos Province|Sucumb\u00edos]], and [[Zamora-Chinchipe Province|Zamora-Chinchipe]]. This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers. Several of the larger islands, however, have freshwater springs although they are surrounded by the Pacific Ocean.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Oso andino Porcon.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Ecuador is one of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world, it also has the most biodiversity per square kilometer of any nation, and is one of the highest [[endemism]] worldwide.

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184150/http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF |date=May 3, 2011 }}</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.\n\n===Art===\nThe best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quite\u00f1a]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

The 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign was considered a huge success for the country and its inhabitants.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The unusually high elevation of the home stadium in Quito often affects the performance of visiting teams. Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] finishing second behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

Between 100 BC and 100 AD. Found in [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]]]]\nVarious peoples had settled in the area of future Ecuador before the arrival of the [[Incas]]. The archeological evidence suggests that the [[Paleo-Indians]]' first dispersal into the Americas occurred near the end of the [[last glacial period]], around 16,500\u201313,000 years ago. The first Indians who reached Ecuador may have journeyed by land from North and Central America or by boat down the [[Pacific Ocean]] coastline. Much later migrations to Ecuador may have come via the Amazon tributaries, others descended from northern [[South America]], and others ascended from the southern part of South America through the Andes. They developed different languages while emerging as unique ethnic groups.\n\nEven though their languages were unrelated, these groups developed similar groups of cultures, each based in different environments. The people of the coast developed a fishing, hunting, and gathering culture; the people of the highland Andes developed a sedentary agricultural way of life, and the people of the Amazon basin developed a nomadic hunting-and-gathering mode of existence.\n\nOver time these groups began to interact and intermingle with each other so that groups of families in one area became one community or tribe, with a similar language and culture. Many civilizations arose in Ecuador, such as the [[Valdivia Culture]] and [[Machalilla Culture]] on the coast, the [[Quitus]] (near present-day Quito), and the [[Ca\u00f1ari]] (near present-day [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]). Each civilization developed its own distinctive architecture, pottery, and religious interests.\n\nIn the highland Andes mountains, where life was more sedentary, groups of tribes cooperated and formed villages; thus the first nations based on agricultural resources and the domestication of animals formed. Eventually, through wars and marriage alliances of their [[leader]]s, a group of nations formed confederations. One region consolidated under a confederation called the [[Shyris]], which exercised organized trading and bartering between the different regions. Its political and military power came under the rule of the Duchicela blood-line.\n\n===Inca era===\n[[File:Ecuador ingapirca inca ruins.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Ingapirca]], this site served as an outpost and provisioning of the Incan troops, but mainly it was a place of worship and veneration to the sun, the supreme Inca God, thus constituting a [[Coricancha]], dedicated to the Inca ritual.]]\n[[File:M\u00famia de cabe\u00e7a - Povo Jivaro 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Hispanic shrunken head of the [[Shuar]]s ([[Jivaroan peoples]]).]]\nWhen the [[Incas]] arrived, they found that these confederations were so developed that it took the Incas two generations of rulers\u2014[[Topa Inca Yupanqui]] and [[Huayna Capac]]\u2014to absorb them into the [[Inca Empire]]. The native confederations that gave them the most problems were deported to distant areas of Peru, Bolivia, and north Argentina. Similarly, a number of loyal Inca subjects from Peru and Bolivia were brought to Ecuador to prevent rebellion. Thus, the region of highland Ecuador became part of the [[Inca Empire]] in 1463 sharing the same language.\n\nIn contrast, when the Incas made incursions into coastal Ecuador and the eastern Amazon jungles of Ecuador, they found both the environment and indigenous people more hostile. Moreover, when the Incas tried to subdue them, these indigenous people withdrew to the interior and resorted to [[guerrilla]] tactics. As a result, Inca expansion into the Amazon Basin and the Pacific coast of Ecuador was hampered. The indigenous people of the Amazon jungle and coastal Ecuador remained relatively autonomous until the Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in force. The Amazonian people and the [[Chachi people|Cayapas]] of Coastal Ecuador were the only groups to resist Inca and Spanish domination, maintaining their language and culture well into the 21st century.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spaniards, the Inca Empire was involved in a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]]. The untimely death of both the heir Ninan Cuchi and the Emperor Huayna Capac, from a European disease that spread into Ecuador, created a power vacuum between two factions. The northern faction headed by Atahualpa claimed that Huayna Capac gave a verbal decree before his death about how the empire should be divided. He gave the territories pertaining to present-day Ecuador and northern Peru to his favorite son Atahualpa, who was to rule from Quito; and he gave the rest to [[Hu\u00e1scar]], who was to rule from [[Cuzco]]. He willed that his heart be buried in Quito, his favorite city, and the rest of his body be buried with his ancestors in Cuzco.\n\nHu\u00e1scar did not recognize his father's will, since it did not follow Inca traditions of naming an Inca through the priests. Hu\u00e1scar ordered Atahualpa to attend their father's burial in Cuzco and pay homage to him as the new Inca ruler. Atahualpa, with a large number of his father's veteran soldiers, decided to ignore Hu\u00e1scar, and a civil war ensued. A number of bloody battles took place until finally Hu\u00e1scar was captured. Atahualpa marched south to Cuzco and massacred the royal family associated with his brother.\n\nIn 1532, a small band of Spaniards headed by Francisco Pizarro landed in Tumbez and marched over the Andes Mountains until they reached Cajamarca, where the new Inca Atahualpa was to hold an interview with them. Valverde, the priest, tried to convince Atahualpa that he should join the Catholic Church and declare himself a vassal of Spain. This infuriated Atahualpa so much that he threw the Bible to the ground. At this point the enraged Spaniards, with orders from Valverde, attacked and massacred unarmed escorts of the Inca and captured Atahualpa. [[Pizarro]] promised to release Atahualpa if he made good his promise of filling a room full of gold. But, after a mock trial, the Spaniards executed Atahualpa by strangulation.\n\n===Spanish rule===\n[[File:Plaza principal de Quito, an\u00f3nimo - siglo XVIII (Museo de la Moneda, Bogot\u00e1).jpg|thumb|Major square of Quito.

At the same time, the natives were forced into the ''[[encomienda]]'' labor system for the Spanish. In 1563, [[Quito]] became the seat of a [[Royal Audience of Quito|real audiencia]] (administrative district) of Spain and part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] and later the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]].\n\nThe [[1797 Riobamba earthquake]], which caused up to 40,000 casualties, was studied by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], when he visited the area in 1801\u20131802.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lavilla|first=E.O.|year=2004|title=Under the Southern Cross: Stories around Humboldt and Bonpland's trip to the New Continent|journal=Latin American Applied Research|volume=34|pages=203\u2013208|url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/pdf/laar/v34n4/v34n4a01.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter nearly 300 years of Spanish rule, Quito was still a small city numbering 10,000 inhabitants. On August 10, 1809, the city's ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' called for independence from Spain (first among the peoples of Latin America). They were led by Juan P\u00edo Mont\u00fafar, Quiroga, Salinas, and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Quito's nickname, \"''[[Luz de Am\u00e9rica]]''\" (\"Light of America\"), is based on its leading role in trying to secure an independent, local government. Although the new government lasted no more than two months, it had important repercussions and was an inspiration for the independence movement of the rest of Spanish America. August 10 is now celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Ecuador|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |title=Ecuador en el d\u00eda de la Independencia nacional |date=2017-08-10 |work=El Tel\u00e9grafo |access-date=2018-08-08 |language=es-es |df=mdy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808202916/https://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/editoriales/19/ecuador-en-el-dia-de-la-independencia-nacional |archive-date=August 8, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Independence===\n{{Main|Ecuadorian War of Independence}}\n[[File:Jose Antonio de Sucre.JPG|thumb|upright|Venezuelan independence leader [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]]]]\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"[[Guayaquil Conference]]\" was the meeting between the two main Hispanic South American independence leaders.

Its inhabitants celebrated what is now Ecuador's official Independence Day on May 24, 1822. The rest of Ecuador gained its independence after [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated the Spanish Royalist forces at the [[Battle of Pichincha]], near [[Quito]]. Following the battle, Ecuador joined [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]'s [[Republic of Gran Colombia]], also including modern-day [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. In 1830, Ecuador separated from Gran Colombia and became an independent republic.\n\nThe 19th century was marked by instability for Ecuador with a rapid succession of rulers. The first president of Ecuador was the Venezuelan-born [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], who was ultimately deposed, followed by several authoritarian leaders, such as [[Vicente Rocafuerte]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo]]; [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Urbina]]; [[Diego Noboa]]; [[Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Arteta]]; [[Manuel de Asc\u00e1subi]]; and Flores's own son, [[Antonio Flores Jij\u00f3n]], among others. The conservative [[Gabriel Garcia Moreno]] unified the country in the 1860s with the support of the Roman Catholic Church. In the late 19th century, world demand for [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] tied the economy to commodity exports and led to migrations from the highlands to the agricultural frontier on the coast.\n\nEcuador [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished]] [[Slavery in Latin America|slavery]] and freed its black slaves in 1851.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |title=Assessment for Blacks in Ecuador |publisher=CIDCM |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622220302/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/assessment.asp?groupId=13001 |archivedate=June 22, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n===Liberal Revolution===\n[[File:Historic Center of Quito - World Heritage Site by UNESCO - Photo 437.jpg|thumb|Antique [[Dugout (boat)|dug out canoes]] in the courtyard of the Old Military Hospital in the [[Historic Center of Quito]]]]\n{{Main|Liberal Revolution of 1895}}\nThe Liberal Revolution of 1895 under [[Eloy Alfaro]] reduced the power of the clergy and the conservative land owners. This liberal wing retained power until the military \"Julian Revolution\" of 1925. The 1930s and 1940s were marked by instability and emergence of populist politicians, such as five-time President [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra]].\n\n===Loss of claimed territories since 1830===\n{{Main|History of the Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian territorial dispute}}\n{{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n\n====President Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores de jure territorial claims====\nSince Ecuador's separation from Colombia in May 13, 1830, its first President, General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], laid claim to the territory that was called the [[Real Audiencia of Quito]], also referred to as the Presidencia of Quito. He supported his claims with Spanish Royal decrees or ''Real Cedulas'', that delineated the borders of Spain's former overseas colonies. In the case of Ecuador, Flores-based Ecuador's ''[[de jure]]'' claims on the following cedulas - Real Cedula of 1563, 1739, and 1740; with modifications in the Amazon Basin and Andes Mountains that were introduced through the Treaty of Guayaquil (1829) which Peru reluctantly signed, after the overwhelmingly outnumbered Gran Colombian force led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]] defeated President and General La Mar's Peruvian invasion force in the [[Battle of Tarqui]]. In addition, Ecuador's eastern border with the Portuguese colony of [[Brazil]] in the Amazon Basin was modified before the wars of Independence by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]] (1777) between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Moreover, to add legitimacy to his claims, on February 16, 1840, Flores signed a treaty with Spain, whereby Flores convinced Spain to officially recognize Ecuadorian independence and its sole rights to colonial titles over Spain's former colonial territory known anciently to Spain as the Kingdom and Presidency of Quito.\n\nEcuador during its long and turbulent history has lost most of its contested territories to each of its more powerful neighbors, such as Colombia in 1832 and 1916, Brazil in 1904 through a series of peaceful treaties, and Peru after a short war in which the Protocol of Rio de Janeiro was signed in 1942.\n\n====Struggle for independence====\nDuring the [[Spanish American wars of independence|struggle for independence]], before Peru or Ecuador became independent nations, a few areas of the former Vice Royalty of New Granada - Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n - declared themselves independent from Spain. A few months later, a part of the Peruvian liberation army of San Martin decided to occupy the independent cities of Tumbez and Ja\u00e9n with the intention of using these towns as springboards to occupy the independent city of Guayaquil and then to liberate the rest of the Audiencia de Quito (Ecuador). It was common knowledge among the top officers of the liberation army from the south that their leader [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn|San Martin]] wished to liberate present-day Ecuador and add it to the future republic of Peru, since it had been part of the Inca Empire before the Spaniards conquered it.\n\nHowever, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]]'s intention was to form a new republic known as the Gran Colombia, out of the liberated Spanish territory of New Granada which consisted of Colombia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. San Martin's plans were thwarted when [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar|Bol\u00edvar]], with the help of Marshal Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and the Gran Colombian liberation force, descended from the Andes mountains and occupied Guayaquil; they also annexed the newly liberated Audiencia de Quito to the Republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. This happened a few days before San Martin's Peruvian forces could arrive and occupy Guayaquil, with the intention of annexing Guayaquil to the rest of Audiencia of Quito (Ecuador) and to the future republic of Peru. Historic documents repeatedly stated that San Martin told Bolivar he came to Guayaquil to liberate the land of the Incas from Spain. Bolivar countered by sending a message from Guayaquil welcoming San Martin and his troops to Colombian soil.\n\n====Peruvian occupation of Ja\u00e9n, Tumbes, and Guayaquil====\nIn the south, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to a small piece of land beside the Pacific Ocean known as [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]] which lay between the [[Zarumilla River|Zarumilla]] and [[Tumbes River|Tumbes]] rivers. In Ecuador's southern Andes Mountain region where the Mara\u00f1on cuts across, Ecuador had ''de jure'' claims to an area it called [[Ja\u00e9n, Peru|Ja\u00e9n de Bracamoros]]. These areas were included as part of the territory of Gran Colombia by Bolivar on December 17, 1819, during the [[Congress of Angostura]] when the Republic of Gran Colombia was created. Tumbes declared itself independent from Spain on January 17, 1821, and Jaen de Bracamoros on June 17, 1821, without any outside help from revolutionary armies. However, that same year, 1821, Peruvian forces participating in the Trujillo revolution occupied both Jaen and Tumbes. Some Peruvian generals, without any legal titles backing them up and with Ecuador still federated with the Gran Colombia, had the desire to annex Ecuador to the Republic of Peru at the expense of the Gran Colombia, feeling that Ecuador was once part of the Inca Empire.\n\nOn July 28, 1821, Peruvian independence was proclaimed in Lima by the Liberator San Martin, and Tumbes and Jaen, which were included as part of the revolution of Trujillo by the Peruvian occupying force, had the whole region swear allegiance to the new Peruvian flag and incorporated itself into Peru, even though Peru was not completely liberated from Spain. After Peru was completely liberated from Spain by the patriot armies led by Bolivar and Antonio Jose de Sucre at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] dated December 9, 1824, there was a strong desire by some Peruvians to resurrect the [[Inca Empire]] and to include Bolivia and Ecuador. One of these Peruvian Generals was the Ecuadorian-born [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who became one of Peru's presidents after Bolivar resigned as dictator of Peru and returned to Colombia. Gran Colombia had always protested Peru for the return of Jaen and Tumbes for almost a decade, then finally Bolivar after long and futile discussion over the return of Jaen, Tumbes, and part of Mainas, declared war. President and General [[Jos\u00e9 de La Mar]], who was born in Ecuador, believing his opportunity had come to annex the District of Ecuador to Peru, personally, with a Peruvian force, invaded and occupied Guayaquil and a few cities in the Loja region of southern Ecuador on November 28, 1828.\n\nThe war ended when a triumphant heavily outnumbered southern Gran Colombian army at [[Battle of Tarqui]] dated February 27, 1829, led by [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], defeated the Peruvian invasion force led by President La Mar. This defeat led to the signing of the Treaty of Guayaquil dated September 22, 1829, whereby Peru and its Congress recognized Gran Colombian rights over Tumbes, Jaen, and Maynas. Through protocolized meetings between representatives of Peru and Gran Colombia, the border was set as Tumbes river in the west and in the east the Maranon and Amazon rivers were to be followed toward Brazil as the most natural borders between them. However, what was pending was whether the new border around the Jaen region should follow the Chinchipe River or the Huancabamba River. According to the peace negotiations Peru agreed to return Guayaquil, Tumbez, and Ja\u00e9n; despite this, Peru returned Guayaquil, but failed to return Tumbes and Ja\u00e9n, alleging that it was not obligated to follow the agreements, since the Gran Colombia ceased to exist when it divided itself into three different nations - Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.\n\n====The dissolution of Gran Colombia====\n[[File:AGHRC (1890) - Carta XI - Divisi\u00f3n pol\u00edtica de Colombia, 1824.jpg|thumb|Map of the former [[Gran Colombia]] in 1824 (named in its time as Colombia), the Gran Colombia covered all the colored region.]]\n[[File:Ecuador1832.png|thumb|Ecuador in 1832]]\n\nThe Central District of the Gran Colombia, known as Cundinamarca or New Granada (modern Colombia) with its capital in Bogota, did not recognize the separation of the Southern District of the Gran Colombia, with its capital in Quito, from the Gran Colombian federation on May 13, 1830. After Ecuador's separation, the [[Department of Cauca]] voluntarily decided to unite itself with Ecuador due to instability in the central government of Bogota. The Venezuelan born President of Ecuador, the general [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], with the approval of the Ecuadorian congress annexed the Department of Cauca on December 20, 1830, since the government of Cauca had called for union with the District of the South as far back as April 1830. Moreover, the Cauca region, throughout its long history, had very strong economic and cultural ties with the people of Ecuador. Also, the Cauca region, which included such cities as [[Pasto, Colombia|Pasto]], [[Popay\u00e1n]], and [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]], had always been dependent on the Presidencia or Audiencia of Quito.\n\nFruitless negotiations continued between the governments of Bogot\u00e1 and Quito, where the government of Bogot\u00e1 did not recognize the separation of Ecuador or that of Cauca from the Gran Colombia until war broke out in May 1832. In five months, New Granada defeated Ecuador due to the fact that the majority of the Ecuadorian Armed Forces were composed of rebellious angry unpaid veterans from Venezuela and Colombia that did not want to fight against their fellow countrymen. Seeing that his officers were rebelling, mutinying, and changing sides, President Flores had no option but to reluctantly make peace with New Granada. The Treaty of Pasto of 1832 was signed by which the Department of Cauca was turned over to New Granada (modern Colombia), the government of Bogot\u00e1 recognized Ecuador as an independent country and the border was to follow the Ley de Divisi\u00f3n Territorial de la Rep\u00fablica de Colombia (Law of the Division of Territory of the Gran Colombia) passed on June 25, 1824. This law set the border at the river Carchi and the eastern border that stretched to Brazil at the Caquet\u00e1 river. Later, Ecuador contended that the Republic of Colombia, while reorganizing its government, unlawfully made its eastern border provisional and that Colombia extended its claims south to the Napo River because it said that the Government of Popay\u00e1n extended its control all the way to the Napo River.\n\n====Struggle for possession of the Amazon Basin====\n[[File:South America 1879.png|thumb|left|South America (1879): All land claims by Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia in 1879]]\nWhen Ecuador seceded from the Gran Colombia, Peru decided not to follow the treaty of Guayaquil of 1829 or the protocoled agreements made. Peru contested Ecuador's claims with the newly discovered ''Real Cedula'' of 1802, by which Peru claims the King of Spain had transferred these lands from the Viceroyalty of New Granada to the Viceroyalty of Peru. During colonial times this was to halt the ever-expanding Portuguese settlements into Spanish domains, which were left vacant and in disorder after the expulsion of Jesuit missionaries from their bases along the Amazon Basin. Ecuador countered by labeling the Cedula of 1802 an ecclesiastical instrument, which had nothing to do with political borders. Peru began its de facto occupation of disputed Amazonian territories, after it signed a secret 1851 peace treaty in favor of Brazil. This treaty disregarded Spanish rights that were confirmed during colonial times by a Spanish-Portuguese treaty over the Amazon regarding territories held by illegal Portuguese settlers.\n\nPeru began occupying the defenseless missionary villages in the Mainas or Maynas region, which it began calling Loreto, with its capital in [[Iquitos]]. During its negotiations with Brazil, Peru stated that based on the royal cedula of 1802, it claimed Amazonian Basin territories up to Caqueta River in the north and toward the Andes Mountain range, depriving Ecuador and Colombia of all their claims to the Amazon Basin. Colombia protested stating that its claims extended south toward the Napo and Amazon Rivers. Ecuador protested that it claimed the Amazon Basin between the Caqueta river and the Mara\u00f1on-Amazon river. Peru ignored these protests and created the Department of Loreto in 1853 with its capital in Iquitos which it had recently invaded and systematically began to occupy using the river systems in all the territories claimed by both Colombia and Ecuador. Peru briefly occupied Guayaquil again in 1860, since Peru thought that Ecuador was selling some of the disputed land for development to British bond holders, but returned Guayaquil after a few months. The border dispute was then submitted to Spain for arbitration from 1880 to 1910, but to no avail.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, Ecuador made an effort to peacefully define its eastern Amazonian borders with its neighbours through negotiation. On May 6, 1904, Ecuador signed the Tobar-Rio Branco Treaty recognizing Brazil's claims to the Amazon in recognition of Ecuador's claim to be an Amazonian country to counter Peru's earlier Treaty with Brazil back in October 23, 1851. Then after a few meetings with the Colombian government's representatives an agreement was reached and the Mu\u00f1oz Vernaza-Suarez Treaty was signed July 15, 1916, in which Colombian rights to the Putumayo river were recognized as well as Ecuador's rights to the Napo river and the new border was a line that ran midpoint between those two rivers. In this way, Ecuador gave up the claims it had to the Amazonian territories between the Caquet\u00e1 River and Napo River to Colombia, thus cutting itself off from Brazil. Later, a brief war erupted between Colombia and Peru, over Peru's claims to the Caquet\u00e1 region, which ended with Peru reluctantly signing the Salomon-Lozano Treaty on March 24, 1922. Ecuador protested this secret treaty, since Colombia gave away Ecuadorian claimed land to Peru that Ecuador had given to Colombia in 1916.\n\nIn July 21, 1924, the Ponce-Castro Oyanguren Protocol was signed between Ecuador and Peru where both agreed to hold direct negotiations and to resolve the dispute in an equitable manner and to submit the differing points of the dispute to the United States for arbitration. Negotiations between the Ecuadorian and Peruvian representatives began in Washington on September 30, 1935. These negotiations were long and tiresome. Both sides logically presented their cases, but no one seemed to give up their claims. Then on February 6, 1937, Ecuador presented a transactional line which Peru rejected the next day. The negotiations turned into intense arguments during the next 7 months and finally on September 29, 1937, the Peruvian representatives decided to break off the negotiations without submitting the dispute to arbitration because the direct negotiations were going nowhere.\n\nFour years later in 1941, amid fast-growing tensions within disputed territories around the Zarumilla River, war broke out with Peru. Peru claimed that Ecuador's military presence in Peruvian-claimed territory was an invasion; Ecuador, for its part, claimed that Peru had recently invaded Ecuador around the Zarumilla River and that Peru since Ecuador's independence from Spain has systematically occupied Tumbez, Jaen, and most of the disputed territories in the Amazonian Basin between the Putomayo and Mara\u00f1on Rivers. In July 1941, troops were mobilized in both countries. Peru had an army of 11,681 troops who faced a poorly supplied and inadequately armed Ecuadorian force of 2,300, of which only 1,300 were deployed in the southern provinces. Hostilities erupted on July 5, 1941, when Peruvian forces crossed the Zarumilla river at several locations, testing the strength and resolve of the Ecuadorian border troops. Finally, on July 23, 1941, the Peruvians launched a major invasion, crossing the Zarumilla river in force and advancing into the Ecuadorian province of [[El Oro Province|El Oro]].\n\n[[File:Ecuador-peru-land-claims-01.png|thumb|left|Map of Ecuadorian land claims after 1916]]\n\nDuring the course of the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], Peru gained control over part of the disputed territory and some parts of the province of El Oro, and some parts of the [[Loja Province|province of Loja]], demanding that the Ecuadorian government give up its territorial claims. The Peruvian Navy blocked the port of [[Guayaquil]], almost cutting all supplies to the Ecuadorian troops. After a few weeks of war and under pressure by the United States and several Latin American nations, all fighting came to a stop. Ecuador and Peru came to an accord formalized in the [[Rio Protocol]], signed on January 29, 1942, in favor of hemispheric unity against the [[Axis Powers]] in [[World War II]] favouring Peru with the territory they occupied at the time the war came to an end.\n\nThe 1944 [[Glorious May Revolution]] followed a military-civilian rebellion and a subsequent civic strike which successfully removed Carlos Arroyo del R\u00edo as a dictator from Ecuador's government. However, a post-Second World War recession and popular unrest led to a return to populist politics and domestic military interventions in the 1960s, while foreign companies developed oil resources in the Ecuadorian Amazon. In 1972, construction of the Andean pipeline was completed. The pipeline brought oil from the east side of the Andes to the coast, making Ecuador South America's second largest oil exporter. The pipeline in southern Ecuador did nothing to resolve tensions between Ecuador and Peru, however.\n\n[[File:Relevo-ecu.JPG|thumb|Ecuadorian troops during the [[Cenepa War]]]]\n[[File:Mirage F.1JA.JPG|thumb|The [[Dassault Mirage F1|Mirage F.1JA]] (FAE-806) was one aircraft involved in the claimed shooting down of two Peruvian [[Sukhoi Su-22]] on February 10, 1995.]]\nThe [[Rio Protocol]] failed to precisely resolve the border along a little river in the remote ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor'' region in southern Ecuador. This caused a long-simmering dispute between Ecuador and Peru, which ultimately led to fighting between the two countries; first a border skirmish in January\u2013February 1981 known as the [[Paquisha Incident]], and ultimately full-scale warfare in January 1995 where the Ecuadorian military shot down Peruvian aircraft and helicopters and Peruvian infantry marched into southern Ecuador. Each country blamed the other for the onset of hostilities, known as the [[Cenepa War]]. [[Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n]], the Ecuadorian president, famously declared that he would not give up a single centimeter of Ecuador. Popular sentiment in Ecuador became strongly [[nationalism|nationalistic]] against Peru: graffiti could be seen on the walls of Quito referring to Peru as the \"''Cain de Latinoam\u00e9rica''\", a reference to the murder of [[Abel]] by his brother [[Cain]] in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Roos, Wilma and van Renterghem, Omer ''Ecuador'', New York, 2000, p.5.</ref>\n\nEcuador and Peru signed the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]] peace agreement on October 26, 1998, which ended hostilities, and effectively put an end to the Western Hemisphere's longest running territorial dispute.<ref name=\"ucdp.uu.se\">{{cite web|title=Uppsala Conflict Data Program - Conflict Encyclopedia, General Conflict Information, Conflict name: Ecuador - Peru, In depth, Background to the 1995 fighting and Ecuador and Peru engage in armed conflict|accessdate=July 15, 2013|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas#|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150723/http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=126&regionSelect=5-Southern_Americas|archive-date=September 27, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The Guarantors of the [[Rio Protocol]] (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States of America) ruled that the border of the undelineated zone was to be set at the line of the ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''.

The [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] was led by General [[Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez (politician)|Guillermo Rodr\u00edguez]] and executed by navy commander Jorge Queirolo G. The new president exiled Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco to [[Argentina]]. He remained in power until 1976, when he was removed by another military government. That military junta was led by Admiral [[Alfredo Poveda]], who was declared chairman of the Supreme Council. The Supreme Council included two other members: General Guillermo Dur\u00e1n Arcentales and General Luis Leoro Franco. The civil society more and more insistently called for democratic elections. Colonel [[Richelieu Levoyer]], Government Minister, proposed and implemented a Plan to return to the constitutional system through universal elections. This plan enabled the new democratically elected president to assume the duties of the executive office.\n\n===Return to democracy===\nElections were held on April 29, 1979, under a new constitution. [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] was elected president, garnering over one million votes, the most in Ecuadorian history. He took office on August 10, as the first constitutionally elected president after nearly a decade of civilian and military dictatorships. In 1980, he founded the ''Partido Pueblo, Cambio y Democracia'' (People, Change, and Democracy Party) after withdrawing from the ''Concentraci\u00f3n de Fuerzas Populares'' (Popular Forces Concentration) and governed until May 24, 1981, when he died along with his wife and the minister of defense, [[Marco Subia Martinez]], when his Air Force plane crashed in heavy rain near the Peruvian border. Many people believe that he was assassinated by the CIA,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} given the multiple death threats leveled against him because of his reformist agenda, deaths in automobile crashes of two key witnesses before they could testify during the investigation, and the sometimes contradictory accounts of the incident.\n\nRoldos was immediately succeeded by Vice President Osvaldo Hurtado, who was followed in 1984 by [[Le\u00f3n Febres Cordero]] from the Social Christian Party. [[Rodrigo Borja Cevallos]] of the Democratic Left (Izquierda Democr\u00e1tica, or ID) party won the presidency in 1988, running in the runoff election against [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] (brother in law of [[Jaime Roldos]] and founder of the Ecuadorian Roldosist Party). His government was committed to improving human rights protection and carried out some reforms, notably an opening of Ecuador to foreign trade. The Borja government concluded an accord leading to the disbanding of the small terrorist group, \"[[\u00a1Alfaro Vive, Carajo!]]\" (\"Alfaro Lives, Dammit!\"), named after [[Eloy Alfaro]]. However, continuing economic problems undermined the popularity of the ID, and opposition parties gained control of Congress in 1999.\n[[File:CAMBIO DE GUARDIA.jpg|thumb|President [[Len\u00edn Moreno]], first lady [[Roc\u00edo Gonz\u00e1lez Navas]] and his predecessor [[Rafael Correa]], 3 April 2017]]\nThe emergence of the Amerindian population as an active constituency has added to the democratic volatility of the country in recent years. The population has been motivated by government failures to deliver on promises of land reform, lower unemployment and provision of social services, and historical exploitation by the land-holding elite. Their movement, along with the continuing destabilizing efforts by both the elite and leftist movements, has led to a deterioration of the executive office. The populace and the other branches of government give the president very little political capital, as illustrated by the most recent removal of President [[Lucio Guti\u00e9rrez]] from office by Congress in April 2005.

Once Gran Colombia was dissolved after the death of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] in 1830, Ecuador inherited the same border disputes and had the need of creating its own professional military force. So influential was the military in Ecuador in the early republican period that its first decade was under the control of General [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Flores]], first president of Ecuador of Venezuelan origin. General Jose Ma. Urbina and General Robles are examples of military figures who became presidents of the country in the early republican period.\n\nDue to the continuous border disputes with Peru, finally settled in the early 2000s, and due to the ongoing problem with the Colombian guerrilla insurgency infiltrating Amazonian provinces, the Ecuadorian Armed Forces has gone through a series of changes. In 2009, the new administration at the Defense Ministry launched a deep restructuring within the forces, increasing spending budget to $1,691,776,803, an increase of 25%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506111602/http://www.ccmr.org/public/library_file_proxy.cfm/lid/5603 |archivedate=May 6, 2009 |title=Ecuador: A Comparative Atlas of Defence in Latin America / 2008 Edition|publisher=ccmr.org |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe icons of the Ecuadorian military forces are Marshall Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre and General [[Eloy Alfaro]].

It is the country's most fertile and productive land, and is the seat of the large [[banana]] exportation plantations of the companies [[Dole Food Company|Dole]] and [[Chiquita]]. This region is also where most of Ecuador's [[rice]] crop is grown. The truly coastal provinces have active fisheries. The largest coastal city is [[Guayaquil]].\n* '''La Sierra''', or \"the highlands\": The sierra consists of the Andean and Interandean highland provinces&nbsp;\u2013 [[Azuay Province|Azuay]], [[Ca\u00f1ar Province|Ca\u00f1ar]], [[Carchi Province|Carchi]], [[Chimborazo Province|Chimborazo]], [[Imbabura Province|Imbabura]], [[Loja Province|Loja]], [[Pichincha Province|Pichincha]], and [[Tungurahua Province|Tungurahua]].

Agriculture is focused on the traditional crops of [[potato]], [[maize]], and [[Quinoa|quinua]] and the population is predominantly Amerindian [[Quechua people|Kichua]].

This region is primarily made up of the huge Amazon national parks and Amerindian untouchable zones, which are vast stretches of land set aside for the Amazon Amerindian tribes to continue living traditionally. It is also the area with the largest reserves of [[petroleum]] in Ecuador, and parts of the upper Amazon here have been extensively exploited by petroleum companies. The population is primarily mixed Amerindian [[Shuar]], [[Huaorani]] and [[Quechua people|Kichua]], although there are numerous tribes in the deep jungle which are little-contacted. The largest city in the Oriente is probably [[Nueva Loja|Lago Agrio]] in Sucumb\u00edos, although [[Macas (city)|Macas]] in Morona Santiago runs a close second.\n* '''La Regi\u00f3n Insular''' is the region comprising the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], some {{convert|1000|km|mi}} west of the mainland in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nEcuador's capital is Quito, which is in the province of [[Pichincha Province, Ecuador|Pichincha]] in the Sierra region.

It is mild year-round in the mountain valleys, with a [[humid subtropical climate]] in coastal areas and [[rainforest]] in lowlands. The Pacific coastal area has a [[tropical climate]] with a severe rainy season. The climate in the Andean highlands is [[Temperateness|temperate]] and relatively dry, and the Amazon basin on the eastern side of the mountains shares the climate of other rainforest zones.\n\nBecause of its location at the equator, Ecuador experiences little variation in daylight hours during the course of a year. Both sunrise and sunset occur each day at the two six o'clock hours.<ref name=CIA/>\n\n===Hydrology===\n{{Main|Rivers of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Canyoning en Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]] is an important tourist site]]\n\nThe Andes is the ''watershed divisor'' between the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] watershed, which runs to the east, and the Pacific, including the north\u2013south rivers Mataje, Santiago, [[Esmeraldas River|Esmeraldas]], [[Chone River|Chone]], [[Guayas River|Guayas]], Jubones, and Puyango-Tumbes.\n\nAlmost all of the rivers in Ecuador form in the Sierra region and flow east toward the [[Amazon River]] or west toward the Pacific Ocean. The rivers rise from snowmelt at the edges of the snowcapped peaks or from the abundant precipitation that falls at higher elevations. In the Sierra region, the streams and rivers are narrow and flow rapidly over precipitous slopes. Rivers may slow and widen as they cross the hoyas yet become rapid again as they flow from the heights of the [[Andes]] to the lower elevations of the other regions. The highland rivers broaden as they enter the more level areas of the Costa and the Oriente.\n\n[[File:Driving the beach salinas ecuador.jpg|thumb|A beach of [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], [[Santa Elena Province]]]]\nIn the Costa, the external coast has mostly intermittent rivers that are fed by constant rains from December through May and become empty riverbeds during the dry season. The few exceptions are the longer, perennial rivers that flow throughout the external coast from the internal coast and La Sierra on their way to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The internal coast, by contrast, is crossed by perennial rivers that may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.\n\nMajor rivers in the Oriente include the [[Pastaza River|Pastaza]], [[Napo River|Napo]], and [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]]. The Pastaza is formed by the confluence of the Chambo and the Patate rivers, both of which rise in the Sierra. The Pastaza includes the Agoyan waterfall, which at {{convert|61|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us|spell=in}} is the highest waterfall in Ecuador. The Napo rises near Mount Cotopaxi and is the major river used for transport in the eastern lowlands. The Napo ranges in width from {{convert|500|to|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In its upper reaches, the Napo flows rapidly until the confluence with one of its major tributaries, the Coca River, where it slows and levels off. The Putumayo forms part of the border with Colombia. All of these rivers flow into the [[Amazon River]]. The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands have no significant rivers.

Culturally, the Toquilla straw hat and the culture of the Zapara indigenous people are recognized. The most popular sites for national and foreign tourists have different nuances due to the various tourist activities offered by the country.\n\nAmong the main tourist destinations are:\n\n*Nature attractions: [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]], [[Yasuni National Park]], [[El Cajas National Park]], [[Sangay National Park]], [[Podocarpus National Park]], [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador|Vilcabamba]], [[Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa]].\n*Cultural attractions: [[Quito|Historic center of Quito]], [[Ciudad Mitad del Mundo]], [[Ingapirca]], [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Historic center of Cuenca]], [[Latacunga]] and its Mama Negra festival.\n*Snowy mountains: [[Antisana]] volcano, [[Cayambe (volcano)|Cayambe]] volcano, [[Chimborazo]] volcano, [[Cotopaxi]] volcano, [[Illiniza]]s volcanoes.\n*Beaches: [[Atacames]], [[Bah\u00eda de Car\u00e1quez]], Crucita, [[Esmeraldas, Ecuador|Esmeraldas]], [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]], [[Monta\u00f1ita]], [[Playas, Ecuador|Playas]], [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]]\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Quito Trole 06 2011 1933.jpg|thumb|The [[Trolleybuses in Quito|Troleb\u00fas]] bus rapid transit system that runs through [[Quito]].

The major routes are Pan American (under enhancement from four to six lanes from Rumichaca to Ambato, the conclusion of 4 lanes on the entire stretch of Ambato and Riobamba and running via Riobamba to Loja). In the absence of the section between Loja and the border with Peru, there are the Route Espondilus and/or Ruta del Sol (oriented to travel along the Ecuadorian coastline) and the Amazon backbone (which crosses from north to south along the Ecuadorian Amazon, linking most and more major cities of it).\n\nAnother major project is developing the road Manta \u2013 Tena, the highway Guayaquil \u2013 Salinas Highway Aloag Santo Domingo, Riobamba \u2013 Macas (which crosses Sangay National Park). Other new developments include the National Unity bridge complex in Guayaquil, the bridge over the Napo river in Francisco de Orellana, the Esmeraldas River Bridge in the city of the same name, and, perhaps the most remarkable of all, the Bahia \u2013 San Vincente Bridge, being the largest on the Latin American Pacific coast.\n\n[[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]]'s tramway is the largest public transport system in the city and the first modern tramway in Ecuador. It was inaugurated on March 8, 2019. It has 20,4&nbsp;km and 27 stations. It will transport 120 000 passagers daily. Its route starts in the south of Cuenca and ends in the north at the Parque Industrial neighbourhood.\n\nThe [[Mariscal Sucre International Airport]] in Quito and the [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Olmedo International Airport]] in [[Guayaquil]] have experienced a high increase in demand and have required modernization.

Even though Ecuador's white population during its colonial era were mainly descendants from Spain, today Ecuador's white population is a result of a mixture of European immigrants, predominantly from Spain with people from Italy, Germany, France, and Switzerland who have settled in the early 20th century. Ecuador also has people of middle eastern extraction that have also joined the ranks of the white minority. These include economically well off immigrants of Lebanese and Palestinian descent, who are either Christian or Muslim ([[Islam in Ecuador]]).

The first and most substantial wave of modern immigration to Ecuador consisted of Spanish colonists, following the arrival of Europeans in 1499. A lower number of other Europeans and North Americans migrated to the country in the late 19th and early twentieth centuries and, in smaller numbers, Poles, Lithuanians, English, Irish, and Croats during and after the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Alicia Cahuiya, Caso Tagaeri y Taromenani.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Huaorani people|Huaorani]] man with the typical Amazonian indigenous clothes]]\n\nSince African slavery was not the workforce of the Spanish colonies in the Andes Mountains, given the subjugation of the Amerindian people through proselytization and ''[[encomiendas]]'', the minority population of African descent is mostly found in the coastal northern province of Esmeraldas. This is largely owing to the 17th-century shipwreck of a slave-trading galleon off the northern coast of Ecuador. The few black African survivors swam to the shore and penetrated the then-thick jungle under the leadership of Anton, the chief of the group, where they remained as free men maintaining their original culture, not influenced by the typical elements found in other provinces of the coast or in the Andean region. A little later, freed slaves from Colombia known as ''cimarrones'' joined them. In the small Chota Valley of the province of Imbabura exists a small community of Africans among the province's predominantly mestizo population. These blacks are descendants of Africans, who were brought over from Colombia by Jesuits to work their colonial sugar plantations as slaves. As a general rule, small elements of zambos and mulattoes coexisted among the overwhelming mestizo population of coastal Ecuador throughout its history as gold miners in Loja, Zaruma, and Zamora and as shipbuilders and plantation workers around the city of Guayaquil. Today you can find a small community of Africans in the Catamayo valley of the predominantly mestizo population of Loja.\n\nEcuador's Amerindian communities are integrated into the mainstream culture to varying degrees,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|title=Photos Indigenous people of Ecuador|author=Elisabeth Hurtel|publisher=South-images.com|accessdate=September 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120911181907/http://www.south-images.com/photos-andes-ecuador.htm|archivedate=September 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but some may also practice their own native cultures, particularly the more remote Amerindian communities of the [[Amazon basin]]. Spanish is spoken as the first language by more than 90% of the population and as a first or second language by more than 98%. Part of Ecuador's population can speak [[Amerindian]] languages, in some cases as a second language. Two percent of the population speak only Amerindian languages.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Languages of Ecuador }}\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages in Ecuador<ref name=\"CIAPAPUANEWGUINEA\"/>\n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Language\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]] ([[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]) |Blue| 93}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechuan languages|Kichwa]] |Orange|4.1}}\n{{bar percent|Foreign  |Green| 2.2}}\n{{bar percent|Other Indigenous |Red|0.7}}\n}}\n \nMost Ecuadorians speak Spanish as their first language, with its ubiquity permeating and dominating most of the country, though there are many who speak an Amerindian language, such as [[Kichwa]] (also spelt Quichua), which is one of the Quechuan languages and is spoken by approximately 2.5 million people in Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.<ref>[[Kichwa]] Kichwa language page</ref> Other Amerindian languages spoken in Ecuador include Awapit (spoken by the Aw\u00e1), A'ingae (spoken by the Cofan), Shuar Chicham (spoken by the Shuar), Achuar-Shiwiar (spoken by the Achuar and the Shiwiar), Cha'palaachi (spoken by the Chachi), Tsa'fiki (spoken by the Ts\u00e1chila), Paicoca (spoken by the Siona and Secoya), and Wao Tededeo (spoken by the Waorani). Use of these Amerindian languages are, however, gradually diminishing due to Spanish's widespread use in education. Though most features of Ecuadorian Spanish are universal to the Spanish-speaking world, there are several idiosyncrasies.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Ecuador}}\n[[File:Julio jaramillo laurido2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Julio Jaramillo]] is an icon of the old [[Bolero]] music genre.]]\n\nThe music of Ecuador has a long history. [[Pasillo]] is a genre of indigenous Latin music. In Ecuador it is the \"national genre of music\". Through the years, many cultures have brought their influences together to create new types of music. There are also different kinds of traditional music like albazo, pasacalle, fox incaico, tonada, capishca, [[Bomba (Ecuador)|Bomba]] (highly established in Afro-Ecuadorian societies), and so on. [[Tecnocumbia]] and Rockola are clear examples of the influence of foreign cultures. One of the most traditional forms of dancing in Ecuador is [[Sanjuanito]]. It is originally from northern Ecuador ([[Otavalo (city)|Otavalo]]-Imbabura). Sanjuanito is a type of dance music played during festivities by the mestizo and Amerindian communities. According to the Ecuadorian musicologist Segundo Luis Moreno, Sanjuanito was danced by Amerindian people during San Juan Bautista's birthday. This important date was established by the Spaniards on June 24, coincidentally the same date when Amerindian people celebrated their rituals of [[Inti Raymi]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{see also|List of Ecuadorian dishes and foods}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Ceviche ecuador.JPG\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Cuy Guinea Pig Dish SG.jpg\n| width2 = 154\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = ''Ceviche ecuatoriano'' (Ecuadorian-style [[ceviche]]) and ''Cuy asado'' (grilled [[guinea pig]]) are some of the typical dishes.\n}}\n[[Ecuadorian cuisine]] is diverse, varying with the altitude and associated agricultural conditions. Most regions in Ecuador follow the traditional three-course meal of soup, a course that includes rice and a protein, and then dessert and coffee to finish. Supper is usually lighter and sometimes consists only of coffee or herbal tea with bread.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the highland region, pork, chicken, beef, and ''cuy'' (guinea pig) are popular and are served with a variety of grains (especially rice and corn) or potatoes.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the coastal region, seafood is very popular, with fish, shrimp, and ''[[ceviche]]'' being key parts of the diet. Generally, ceviches are served with fried plantain ([[chifle]]s y patacones), popcorn, or [[tostada (tortilla)|tostado]]. [[Plantain (cooking)|Plantain]]- and peanut-based dishes are the basis of most coastal meals. Encocados (dishes that contain a coconut sauce) are also very popular. ''[[Churrasco]]'' is a staple food of the coastal region, especially [[Guayaquil]]. ''Arroz con menestra y carne asada'' (rice with beans and grilled beef) is one of the traditional dishes of Guayaquil, as is [[Tostones|fried plantain]], which is often served with it. This region is a leading producer of [[banana]]s, [[cocoa bean]]s (to make chocolate), shrimp, [[tilapia]], [[mango]], and [[Passiflora edulis|passion fruit]], among other products.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn the Amazon region, a dietary staple is the ''yuca'', elsewhere called [[cassava]]. Many fruits are available in this region, including [[banana]]s, [[Cyphostemma juttae|tree grapes]], and [[Bactris gasipaes|peach palm]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Jmontalvo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Juan Montalvo]]]]\n\nEarly literature in colonial Ecuador, as in the rest of Spanish America, was influenced by the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. One of the earliest examples is [[Jacinto Collahuazo]],<ref name =Boceto>Borja, Piedad. [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF Boceto de Poes\u00eda Ecuatoriana,'Journal de la Academia de Literatura Hispanoamericana', 1972] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184150/http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02104547/articulos/ALHI7272110053A.PDF |date=May 3, 2011 }}</ref> an Amerindian chief of a northern village in today's Ibarra, born in the late 1600s. Despite the early repression and discrimination of the native people by the Spanish, Collahuazo learned to read and write in [[Spanish language|Castilian]], but his work was written in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]. The use of [[Quipu]] was banned by the Spanish,<ref>Robertson, W.S., ''History of the Latin-American Nations'', 1952</ref> and in order to preserve their work, many Inca poets had to resort to the use of the Latin alphabet to write in their native Quechua language. The history behind the Inca drama \"Ollantay\", the oldest literary piece in existence for any Amerindian language in America,<ref>Karnis, ''Surviving Pre-Columbian Drama'', The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1952</ref> shares some similarities with the work of Collahuazo. Collahuazo was imprisoned and all of his work burned. The existence of his literary work came to light many centuries later, when a crew of masons was restoring the walls of a colonial church in Quito and found a hidden manuscript. The salvaged fragment is a Spanish translation from Quechua of the \"Elegy to the Dead of Atahualpa\",<ref name =Boceto/> a poem written by Collahuazo, which describes the sadness and impotence of the Inca people of having lost their king Atahualpa.\n\nOther early Ecuadorian writers include the Jesuits [[Juan Bautista Aguirre]], born in [[Daule Canton|Daule]] in 1725, and Father [[Juan de Velasco]], born in Riobamba in 1727. De Velasco wrote about the nations and chiefdoms that had existed in the ''Kingdom of Quito'' (today Ecuador) before the arrival of the Spanish. His historical accounts are nationalistic, featuring a romantic perspective of precolonial history.\n\nFamous authors from the late colonial and early republic period include [[Eugenio Espejo]], a printer and main author of the first newspaper in Ecuadorian colonial times; [[Jose Joaquin de Olmedo]] (born in Guayaquil), famous for his ode to [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] titled ''Victoria de Junin''; [[Juan Montalvo]], a prominent essayist and novelist; [[Juan Leon Mera]], famous for his work \"Cumanda\" or \"Tragedy among Savages\" and the Ecuadorian National Anthem; Juan A.

One exception is \"The Ecuadorian Deception,\" a murder mystery/thriller authored by American Bear Mills. In it, George d'Hout, a website designer from the United States is lured under false pretenses to Guayaquil. A corrupt American archaeologist is behind the plot, believing d'Hout holds the keys to locating a treasure hidden by a buccaneer ancestor. The story is based on a real pirate by the name of George d'Hout who terrorized Guayaquil in the 16th Century.\n\n===Art===\nThe best known art styles from Ecuador belonged to the ''[[Escuela Quite\u00f1a]]'' (Quito School), which developed from the 16th to 18th centuries, examples of which are on display in various old churches in Quito.

Ecuador finished in 2nd place in the [[CONMEBOL]] qualifiers behind [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and above the team that would become World Champions, [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. In the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Ecuador finished ahead of [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] finishing second behind [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in Group A in the 2006 World Cup.

These terminal degrees, as in the case of the PhD in other countries, were the main requirement for an individual to be accepted in academia as a professor or researcher. In the professional realm, a terminal degree granted by an accredited institution automatically provides a professional license to the individual.\n\nHowever, in 2004, the National Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), started the reorganization of all the degree-granting schemes of the accredited universities in order to pair them with foreign counterparts. The new structure of some careers caused the dropping of subjects, credits, or even the name of the previously conferred diplomas. The terminal degree in law, previously known as JD [[Juris Doctor]] (Doctor en Jurisprudencia) was replaced by the one of ''abogado'' (attorney) with the exception of the modification of the number of credits to equate it to an undergraduate degree. In the same fashion for medical school, the required time of education was considerably reduced from nine years (the minimum needed to obtain the title of MD in Medicine and Surgery) to almost five, with the provision that the diploma is not terminal anymore, and it is given with the title of ''m\u00e9dico'' (medic). Therefore, an MD or PhD in medicine is only to be obtained overseas until the universities adjust themselves to granting schemes and curriculum as in foreign counterparts. Nonetheless, a \"m\u00e9dico\" can start a career as family practitioner or general medicine physician.\n\n[[File:SageoEG - Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil 001.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Biblioteca Municipal de Guayaquil|Municipal Library of Guayaquil]]]]\n\nThis new reorganization, although very ambitious, lacked the proper path to the homologation of diplomas for highly educated professionals graduated in the country or even for the ones graduated in foreign institutions. One of the points of conflict was the imposition of obtaining foreign degrees to current academicians. As today, a master's degree is a requirement to keep an academic position and at least a foreign PhD to attain or retain the status of ''rector'' (president of a university) or ''d\u00e9cano'' (dean). For Ecuadorian researchers and many academicians trained in the country, these regulations sounded illogical, disappointing, and unlawful since it appeared a question of a title name conflict rather than specialization or science advancement.\n\nA debate to modify this and other reforms, especially the one which granted control of the Higher Education System by the government, was practically passed with consensus by the multi-partisan National Assembly on August 4, 2010, but vetoed by President [[Rafael Correa]], who wanted to keep the law strictly as it was originally redacted by his political party and SENPLADES (National Secretary of Planning and Development). Due to this change, there are many highly educated professionals and academicians under the old structure but estimated that only 87% of the faculty in public universities have already obtained a master's degree, and fewer than 5% have a PhD (although many of them already have Ecuadorian-granted doctorate degrees).\n\nAbout 300 institutes of higher education offer two to three years of post-secondary vocational or technical training.\n\n==Sciences and research==\n[[File:NEE-01-PEGASO.jpg|left|thumb|[[Ecuadorian Civilian Space Agency|EXA]]'s first satellite, [[NEE-01 Pegasus]]]]\n\nEcuador is currently placed in 96th position of innovation in technology.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104000235/http://elcomercio.com/sociedad/Tecnologia-innovacion-emprendimiento-emprendedores-Ecuador-desarrollo-nuevasTecnologias_0_995900422.html Ecuador ocupa el puesto 96 en innovaci\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica]. elcomercio.com.

{"title_page": "Optical disc recording technologies", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|optical disk technologies like CD's and DVD's}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}\n{{Optical disc authoring}}\n\n[[Optical disc authoring]] requires a number of different [[optical disc recorder]] technologies working in tandem, from the [[optical disc]] media to the firmware to the control electronics of the [[optical disc drive]]. This article discusses some of the more important technologies.\n\n==Types of recordable optical disc==\n{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nThere are numerous formats of recordable optical [[Direct-to-disk recording|direct to disk]] on the market, all of which are based on using a laser to change the [[reflectivity]] of the [[digital recording]] medium in order to duplicate the effects of the pits and lands created when a commercial optical disc is pressed. Emerging technologies such as [[holographic data storage]] and [[3D optical data storage]] aim to use entirely different data storage methods, but these products are in development and are not yet widely available.\n\nThe earliest form is [[magneto-optical]], which uses a magnetic field in combination with a laser to write to the medium. Though not widely used in consumer equipment, the original [[NeXT]] cube used MO media as its standard storage device, and consumer MO technology is available in the form of [[Sony]]'s [[MiniDisc]]. This form of medium is rewriteable.\n\nThe most common form of recordable optical media is write-once organic dye technology, popularized in the form of the [[CD-R]] and still used for higher-capacity media such as [[DVD-R]]. This uses the laser alone to scorch a transparent organic dye (usually [[cyanine]], [[phthalocyanine]], or [[azo compound]]-based) to create \"pits\" (i.e. dark spots) over a reflective spiral groove. Most such media are designated with an R (recordable) suffix. Such discs are often quite colorful, generally coming in shades of blue or pale yellow or green.\n\nRewritable, non-magnetic optical media are possible using [[phase change material|phase change alloy]]s, which are converted between crystalline and amorphous states (with different reflectivity) using the heat from the drive laser. Such media must be played in specially tuned drives, since the phase-change material has less of a contrast in reflectivity than dye-based media; while most modern drives support such media, many older [[CD drive]]s cannot recognize the narrower threshold and cannot read such discs. Phase-change discs are designated with RW (ReWriteable) or RE (Recordable-Erasable). Phase-change discs often appear dark grey.\n\nAnother technology creates pits in an inorganic carbon layer, a \"write-once\" option.  Created by Millenniata, [[M-DISC]], records data on special M-DISC with a data life-time of several hundred years.<ref name=\"Millenniata\">[http://millenniata.com/m-disc/ M-Disc] millenniata.com. 2010-11-24. Retrieved 20-10-08</ref>\n\n==Optimum Power Calibration==\n{{main|Optimized Power Control}}\n'''Optimum Power Calibration''' (OPC) is a function that checks the proper laser power for writing a particular session in the media in use. More sophisticated is ''Active OPC'', which calculates the optimum laser power and adjusts it in real-time.\n\n==Recording modes==\n{{main|Optical disc recording modes}}\nOptical discs can be recorded in '''Disc At Once''', '''Track At Once''', '''Session at Once''' (i.e. multiple burning sessions for one disc), or '''[[packet writing]]''' modes. Each mode serves different purposes:\n\n*Disc At Once: writes the entire disc in one pass; preferred for duplication masters\n*Track At Once: writes individual tracks with a gap between tracks; used for audio CDs\n*Session At Once: writes and finalizes multiple sessions on one CD; usually not supported for CD Audio, and not universally supported by authoring software\n*Packet writing: writes data to the medium on demand (see below)\n\n==Connection technologies==\n\nUnlike early [[CD-ROM]] drives, optical disc recorder drives have generally used industry standard connection protocols. Early computer-based CD recorders were generally connected by way of [[SCSI]]; however, as SCSI was abandoned by its most significant users (particularly [[Apple Computer]]), it became an expensive option for most computer users. As a result, the market switched over to [[Parallel ATA]] connections for most internal drives; external drives generally use PATA drive mechanisms connected to a bridge inside the case that connects to a high-speed serial bus such as [[FireWire]] or Hi-Speed [[Universal Serial Bus|USB 2.0]]. Nearly all modern drives, particularly [[Blu-ray]] drives use [[Serial ATA]].\n\nStandalone recorders use standard A/V connections, including [[RCA connector]]s, [[TOSlink]], and [[S/PDIF]] for audio and [[RF modulator|RF]], [[composite video]], [[component video]], [[S-Video]], [[SCART]], and [[FireWire]] for video. High-bandwidth digital connections such as [[HDMI]] are unlikely to feature as recorder devices are not permitted to decrypt the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|encrypted]] video content.\n\n==Overburning==\n'''Overburning''' is the process of recording data past the normal size limit. Structures in the [[Absolute Time in Pregroove|ATIP]] do not allow such sizes to be specified.\n\n==Buffer underrun protection==\nUsually, the recorder must perform a complete write without pauses.  Once the laser is on, stopping and restarting the recording process may introduce flaws.\n\nA [[buffer underrun]] occurs during recording if the supply of data to the recorder is interrupted before the write is complete. Software typically moves the data to be recorded into a [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]]; underrun occurs if the recorder processes data in the buffer faster than the software reloads it. Historically, buffer underrun was often caused by writing data obtained from a slow device, or by slowness of the recording software, from a slow processor or a processor executing other tasks concurrently.\n\nVarious recorders minimize or cope with buffer underrun in the following ways:\n*Nearly all burners can slow the rotation of the disc and record at a slower rate. A burner may do so on sensing that it is drawing down the data in the buffer faster than software is reloading it.\n*Recording software maintains larger buffers than when CD recorders were first introduced. Some recorders maintain their own buffer memory independently of the computer. This additional buffering ensures that momentary pauses in the supply of data do not cause buffer underrun.\n*Some recorders are, in fact, able to stop writing in the middle of a session, and resume writing whenever the buffer is refilled. Recorders with such '''buffer underrun protection''' handle the interruption with an extremely small gap in the recorded track on the disc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117015804/http://www.ricoh.com/drive/asia/justlink/j_06.html|title=Products&Solutions {{!}} JustLink {{!}} Ricoh Global|date=2007-11-17|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Since the techniques for protecting against buffer underrun are proprietary and vendor-specific, technical details vary.\n*DVD+R, DVD+RW and the recordable [[Blu-ray]] formats are immune from buffer underrun as these discs contain technology that allows the recorder's write mechanism to precisely locate the end of the recorded track and to seamlessly carry on from where it left off. Many disc authoring utilities disable the buffer underrun protection option when these discs are being written.<ref>Power 2 Go utility help file.</ref>\n\nBuffer underrun is minimized by a strategy in which the recorder burns a [[Packet writing|packet]] rather than an entire session or an entire disc. When using [[rewritable media]] ([[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD-RAM]]), the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system organizes the disc into packets that are written individually.  The packets are referenced by a single, updated address table.\n\n===Specific proprietary technologies===\n\n====''Sanyo'' BURN-Proof====\nBURN-Proof (<u>B</u>uffer <u>U</u>nder<u>r</u>u<u>n</u>-Proof) is a proprietary technology for buffer underrun protection developed by [[Sanyo]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digital-sanyo.com/BURN-Proof/ |title=Sanyo's Official BURN-Proof Site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105170536/http://www.digital-sanyo.com/BURN-Proof/|archivedate=2010-01-05|accessdate=2015-05-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====''Asus'' FlextraLink====\nFlextraLink is a proprietary technology for [[#Buffer underrun protection|buffer underrun protection]] developed by [[Asus]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20081207071949/http://www.asus.com:80/999/html/events/optical/flextralink.htm</ref><ref>https://www.manualslib.com/manual/548879/Asus-Scb-2424a-U.html?page=11 \"FlextraLink\u2122 incorporates a flexible strategy that prevents buffer under-run\nproblems caused by an empty data buffer.

The problem is exacerbated because as the writing laser of the recorder is used, its power output drops with age - typically after just a few years.

This article discusses some of the more important technologies.\n\n==Types of recordable optical disc==\n{{primary sources|date=May 2015}}\n\nThere are numerous formats of recordable optical [[Direct-to-disk recording|direct to disk]] on the market, all of which are based on using a laser to change the [[reflectivity]] of the [[digital recording]] medium in order to duplicate the effects of the pits and lands created when a commercial optical disc is pressed. Emerging technologies such as [[holographic data storage]] and [[3D optical data storage]] aim to use entirely different data storage methods, but these products are in development and are not yet widely available.\n\nThe earliest form is [[magneto-optical]], which uses a magnetic field in combination with a laser to write to the medium. Though not widely used in consumer equipment, the original [[NeXT]] cube used MO media as its standard storage device, and consumer MO technology is available in the form of [[Sony]]'s [[MiniDisc]]. This form of medium is rewriteable.\n\nThe most common form of recordable optical media is write-once organic dye technology, popularized in the form of the [[CD-R]] and still used for higher-capacity media such as [[DVD-R]]. This uses the laser alone to scorch a transparent organic dye (usually [[cyanine]], [[phthalocyanine]], or [[azo compound]]-based) to create \"pits\" (i.e. dark spots) over a reflective spiral groove. Most such media are designated with an R (recordable) suffix. Such discs are often quite colorful, generally coming in shades of blue or pale yellow or green.\n\nRewritable, non-magnetic optical media are possible using [[phase change material|phase change alloy]]s, which are converted between crystalline and amorphous states (with different reflectivity) using the heat from the drive laser. Such media must be played in specially tuned drives, since the phase-change material has less of a contrast in reflectivity than dye-based media; while most modern drives support such media, many older [[CD drive]]s cannot recognize the narrower threshold and cannot read such discs. Phase-change discs are designated with RW (ReWriteable) or RE (Recordable-Erasable). Phase-change discs often appear dark grey.\n\nAnother technology creates pits in an inorganic carbon layer, a \"write-once\" option.  Created by Millenniata, [[M-DISC]], records data on special M-DISC with a data life-time of several hundred years.<ref name=\"Millenniata\">[http://millenniata.com/m-disc/ M-Disc] millenniata.com. 2010-11-24. Retrieved 20-10-08</ref>\n\n==Optimum Power Calibration==\n{{main|Optimized Power Control}}\n'''Optimum Power Calibration''' (OPC) is a function that checks the proper laser power for writing a particular session in the media in use. More sophisticated is ''Active OPC'', which calculates the optimum laser power and adjusts it in real-time.\n\n==Recording modes==\n{{main|Optical disc recording modes}}\nOptical discs can be recorded in '''Disc At Once''', '''Track At Once''', '''Session at Once''' (i.e. multiple burning sessions for one disc), or '''[[packet writing]]''' modes. Each mode serves different purposes:\n\n*Disc At Once: writes the entire disc in one pass; preferred for duplication masters\n*Track At Once: writes individual tracks with a gap between tracks; used for audio CDs\n*Session At Once: writes and finalizes multiple sessions on one CD; usually not supported for CD Audio, and not universally supported by authoring software\n*Packet writing: writes data to the medium on demand (see below)\n\n==Connection technologies==\n\nUnlike early [[CD-ROM]] drives, optical disc recorder drives have generally used industry standard connection protocols. Early computer-based CD recorders were generally connected by way of [[SCSI]]; however, as SCSI was abandoned by its most significant users (particularly [[Apple Computer]]), it became an expensive option for most computer users. As a result, the market switched over to [[Parallel ATA]] connections for most internal drives; external drives generally use PATA drive mechanisms connected to a bridge inside the case that connects to a high-speed serial bus such as [[FireWire]] or Hi-Speed [[Universal Serial Bus|USB 2.0]]. Nearly all modern drives, particularly [[Blu-ray]] drives use [[Serial ATA]].\n\nStandalone recorders use standard A/V connections, including [[RCA connector]]s, [[TOSlink]], and [[S/PDIF]] for audio and [[RF modulator|RF]], [[composite video]], [[component video]], [[S-Video]], [[SCART]], and [[FireWire]] for video. High-bandwidth digital connections such as [[HDMI]] are unlikely to feature as recorder devices are not permitted to decrypt the [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection|encrypted]] video content.\n\n==Overburning==\n'''Overburning''' is the process of recording data past the normal size limit. Structures in the [[Absolute Time in Pregroove|ATIP]] do not allow such sizes to be specified.\n\n==Buffer underrun protection==\nUsually, the recorder must perform a complete write without pauses.  Once the laser is on, stopping and restarting the recording process may introduce flaws.\n\nA [[buffer underrun]] occurs during recording if the supply of data to the recorder is interrupted before the write is complete. Software typically moves the data to be recorded into a [[Buffer (computer science)|buffer]]; underrun occurs if the recorder processes data in the buffer faster than the software reloads it. Historically, buffer underrun was often caused by writing data obtained from a slow device, or by slowness of the recording software, from a slow processor or a processor executing other tasks concurrently.\n\nVarious recorders minimize or cope with buffer underrun in the following ways:\n*Nearly all burners can slow the rotation of the disc and record at a slower rate. A burner may do so on sensing that it is drawing down the data in the buffer faster than software is reloading it.\n*Recording software maintains larger buffers than when CD recorders were first introduced. Some recorders maintain their own buffer memory independently of the computer. This additional buffering ensures that momentary pauses in the supply of data do not cause buffer underrun.\n*Some recorders are, in fact, able to stop writing in the middle of a session, and resume writing whenever the buffer is refilled. Recorders with such '''buffer underrun protection''' handle the interruption with an extremely small gap in the recorded track on the disc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117015804/http://www.ricoh.com/drive/asia/justlink/j_06.html|title=Products&Solutions {{!}} JustLink {{!}} Ricoh Global|date=2007-11-17|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> Since the techniques for protecting against buffer underrun are proprietary and vendor-specific, technical details vary.\n*DVD+R, DVD+RW and the recordable [[Blu-ray]] formats are immune from buffer underrun as these discs contain technology that allows the recorder's write mechanism to precisely locate the end of the recorded track and to seamlessly carry on from where it left off. Many disc authoring utilities disable the buffer underrun protection option when these discs are being written.<ref>Power 2 Go utility help file.</ref>\n\nBuffer underrun is minimized by a strategy in which the recorder burns a [[Packet writing|packet]] rather than an entire session or an entire disc. When using [[rewritable media]] ([[CD-RW]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD-RAM]]), the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system organizes the disc into packets that are written individually.  The packets are referenced by a single, updated address table.\n\n===Specific proprietary technologies===\n\n====''Sanyo'' BURN-Proof====\nBURN-Proof (<u>B</u>uffer <u>U</u>nder<u>r</u>u<u>n</u>-Proof) is a proprietary technology for buffer underrun protection developed by [[Sanyo]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.digital-sanyo.com/BURN-Proof/ |title=Sanyo's Official BURN-Proof Site|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105170536/http://www.digital-sanyo.com/BURN-Proof/|archivedate=2010-01-05|accessdate=2015-05-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====''Asus'' FlextraLink====\nFlextraLink is a proprietary technology for [[#Buffer underrun protection|buffer underrun protection]] developed by [[Asus]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20081207071949/http://www.asus.com:80/999/html/events/optical/flextralink.htm</ref><ref>https://www.manualslib.com/manual/548879/Asus-Scb-2424a-U.html?page=11 \"FlextraLink\u2122 incorporates a flexible strategy that prevents buffer under-run\nproblems caused by an empty data buffer.
