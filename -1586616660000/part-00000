Kyoko, the daughter of a preacher, is a [[magical girl]] from a poor family. Initially depicted as an antagonist, she is aggressive and clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]] over their ideals of justice. As the series progresses, however, her views change and she tries to help Sayaka. Kyoko's past and her relationship with [[Mami Tomoe]] have been explored in the manga spin-off, ''The Different Story''. She has appeared in several ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''-related media, including [[manga]], novels and [[video game]]s.\n\nSeries writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] originally created Kyoko as a [[Foil (fiction)|foil]] to Sayaka Miki; although both characters make similar wishes and experience similar situations, they develop different personalities. Kyoko was designed by [[Ume Aoki]]; Takahiro Kishida adapted Aoki's original design and added a number of features to the character. She is voiced by [[Ai Nonaka]] in the Japanese version, and [[Lauren Landa]] voices her in the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|English version]]. \n\nCritical response to Kyoko has been favorable, with critics calling her character interesting and praising her backstory. Her clash with (and similarity to) Sayaka has been singled out. The character has placed well in several popularity polls, and Kyoko merchandise such as [[Figurine|figures]], [[plush doll]]s and [[keychain]]s has been released.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nKyoko is a [[loner]] [[magical girl]] from the city of Kazamino.<ref name=\"ep4\">{{cite episode|title=Miracles and Magic Are Real|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS & TBS|airdate=January 28, 2011|number=4}}</ref> She has a long red [[ponytail]], fangs and a voracious appetite; she is rarely seen without food.<ref name=\"page38\"/> Kyoko is the daughter of a [[preacher]] who was excommunicated for [[heresy]]. She and her family nearly starve to death after her father's [[excommunication]], which forces her to steal food so they can all survive. Kyoko makes a pact with [[Kyubey]], a messenger of magic, to obtain more followers for her father. Her father goes insane when he learns this, killing the rest of the family and himself; he torments Kyoko, the sole survivor, from beyond the grave. She decides to use her magic only for herself, since using it for others causes pain.<ref name=\"ep8\"/>\n\nKyoko has been a magical girl longer than the other girls, and is more skillful. She uses a spear which can extend itself, split into several sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain which can constrict and hit others.<ref>{{cite episode|title=There's No Way I'll Ever Regret It|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS & TBS|airdate=February 4, 2011|number=5}}</ref> Kyoko can also erect barriers, to protect others or keep them from interfering.<ref name=\"ep8\"/>\n\n==Creation and design==\nKyoko was created by writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] and director [[Akiyuki Shinbo]], and designed by [[Ume Aoki]].<ref name=\"megami\"/> Urobuchi created the character as a foil to [[Sayaka Miki]]. Both make similar wishes: wishing for someone else, while fighting for justice. When their wishes go wrong, they develop different personalities; Kyoko abandons her ideals of justice and begins fighting for herself, while Sayaka refuses to abandon her ideals and slowly despairs.<ref name=\"vol20\">{{Cite book|title=Adult Anime Vol.20|page=32|isbn=978-4862487117|publisher={{Interlanguage link multi|Yosensha|ja|3=\u6d0b\u6cc9\u793e}}|language=Japanese}}</ref> Urobuchi noted that Kyoko sees herself in Sayaka.

Since Kyoko \"ha[s] many different sides to her\", such as an \"emotional side\", a \"mischievous side\" and a \"dark side\", it was \"kind of an obstacle to play through each of these emotions\" and the most difficult aspect of playing the character. Another difficulty was the \"chomping noises\" when Kyoko eats, but \"that way I can add a little bit more viciousness to it so it's kind of fun that way\". Landa said that she enjoyed Kyoko's \"badass\" persona; the actress \"absolutely fell in love with Kyoko\", and had a \"blast\" working with the cast members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9eW0IDrQ0Y|title=Madoka Magica English Cast Video: Kyoko Sakura|author=[[Aniplex of America]]|date=February 10, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=March 25, 2020|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===<span id=\"In ''Madoka Magica''\"></span>''Madoka Magica''===\nKyoko is an experienced magical girl who comes to the city of Mitakihara after [[Mami Tomoe]]'s death.<ref name=\"ep4\"/> From a poor religious family, she wished that people would listen to her father's preaching; when her father learned about this, however, he went mad and killed everyone in his family except her. Kyoko then decides to use her magic only for herself. She initially clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]], trying to kill her due to their different ideals of justice. Kyoko learns that her soul is not attached to her body, but is in her soul gem (the source of their magic). When the soul gem is tainted with negative emotions she becomes a witch; Kyoko then sympathizes with Sayaka, and tries to help her.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Can You Face Your True Feelings?|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS & TBS|airdate=February 18, 2011|number=7}}</ref> Sayaka reminds Kyoko of her old self; wanting to stop Sayaka from making the same mistake, Kyoko tells her to live a life of selfishness.

She is friendlier to Sayaka, and lives in her house. It was revealed that Homura was a witch and created a barrier in her soul gem (with Mitakahira City Homura's idealized world); the Nightmares were created by the barrier so the magical girls can fight, and Kyoko and the other magical girls who were pulled inside the barrier were implanted with false memories. They save Homura by destroying her barrier; she steals Ultimate Madoka's powers and rewrites the universe before proclaiming herself as the devil. Homura gives everyone happy lives in her new world, however, and Kyoko and Sayaka are friends.\n\n===<span id=\"In other media\"></span>Other media===\nIn addition to the main series, Kyoko appears in several manga related to ''Madoka Magica''.

Kyoko, the daughter of a preacher, is a [[magical girl]] from a poor family. Initially depicted as an antagonist, she is aggressive and clashes with [[Sayaka Miki]] over their ideals of justice. As the series progresses, however, her views change and she tries to help Sayaka. Kyoko's past and her relationship with [[Mami Tomoe]] have been explored in the manga spin-off, ''The Different Story''. She has appeared in several ''Puella Magi Madoka Magica''-related media, including [[manga]], novels and [[video game]]s.\n\nSeries writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] originally created Kyoko as a [[Foil (fiction)|foil]] to Sayaka Miki; although both characters make similar wishes and experience similar situations, they develop different personalities. Kyoko was designed by [[Ume Aoki]]; Takahiro Kishida adapted Aoki's original design and added a number of features to the character. She is voiced by [[Ai Nonaka]] in the Japanese version, and [[Lauren Landa]] voices her in the [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|English version]]. \n\nCritical response to Kyoko has been favorable, with critics calling her character interesting and praising her backstory. Her clash with (and similarity to) Sayaka has been singled out. The character has placed well in several popularity polls, and Kyoko merchandise such as [[Figurine|figures]], [[plush doll]]s and [[keychain]]s has been released.\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nKyoko is a [[loner]] [[magical girl]] from the city of Kazamino.<ref name=\"ep4\">{{cite episode|title=Miracles and Magic Are Real|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS & TBS|airdate=January 28, 2011|number=4}}</ref> She has a long red [[ponytail]], fangs and a voracious appetite; she is rarely seen without food.<ref name=\"page38\"/> Kyoko is the daughter of a [[preacher]] who was excommunicated for [[heresy]]. She and her family nearly starve to death after her father's [[excommunication]], which forces her to steal food so they can all survive. Kyoko makes a pact with [[Kyubey]], a messenger of magic, to obtain more followers for her father. Her father goes insane when he learns this, killing the rest of the family and himself; he torments Kyoko, the sole survivor, from beyond the grave. She decides to use her magic only for herself, since using it for others causes pain.<ref name=\"ep8\"/>\n\nKyoko has been a magical girl longer than the other girls, and is more skillful. She uses a spear which can extend itself, split into several sections, and produce a ball at the end of a chain which can constrict and hit others.<ref>{{cite episode|title=There's No Way I'll Ever Regret It|series=Puella Magi Madoka Magica|network=MBS & TBS|airdate=February 4, 2011|number=5}}</ref> Kyoko can also erect barriers, to protect others or keep them from interfering.<ref name=\"ep8\"/>\n\n==Creation and design==\nKyoko was created by writer [[Gen Urobuchi]] and director [[Akiyuki Shinbo]], and designed by [[Ume Aoki]].<ref name=\"megami\"/> Urobuchi created the character as a foil to [[Sayaka Miki]]. Both make similar wishes: wishing for someone else, while fighting for justice.

The MKK and MK2 are currently operated by the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]], [[Indonesian Air Force]], [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], [[Venezuelan Air Force]] and the [[Uganda People's Defence Force|Ugandan Air Force]].<ref>\n{{cite web|access-date=24 March 2015|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Russia-says-Uganda--to-buy-six-more-jets/-/688334/1514634/-/2q25alz/-/index.html|date=23 September 2012|first=Ismail Musa|last=Ladu|title=Russia Says Uganda To Buy Six More Jets|newspaper=[[Daily Monitor]] (Kampala)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402090001/http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Russia-says-Uganda--to-buy-six-more-jets/-/688334/1514634/-/2q25alz/-/index.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web|access-date=24 March 2015|date=3 April 2013|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Su-30-fighter-aircraft-well-ahead-in-air-supremacy/-/539444/1738478/-/item/0/-/2utlrqz/-/index.html|title=Su-30 Fighter Aircraft Well Ahead in Air Supremacy|first=Daniel|last=Ondieki|newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] (Nairobi)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124606/http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Su-30-fighter-aircraft-well-ahead-in-air-supremacy/-/539444/1738478/-/item/0/-/2utlrqz/-/index.html|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}\n</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\nThe People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) leadership became concerned by the [[United States Air Force]]'s (USAF) expanding defended-airspace-penetration and precision-strike capability during the 1990s. As defensive orientated tactics were dropped and more aggressive stances were adopted, the requirement for a heavy fighter with a large combat radius and a [[precision-guided munition]] employment capability was placed upon the political leadership of the People's Republic of China.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nDuring a visit to the Russian Federation at the end of 1996, Chinese Premier [[Li Peng]] signed an agreement worth US$1.8 billion to purchase 38 advanced [[Multirole combat aircraft]]. Technical negotiations started right away.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nSukhoi saw enormous potential to meet China's requirement with its Su-30MK, while incorporating technology from the Su-27M, to develop a new fighter that preserved the type's iconic tall and thick [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] fins as fuel tanks for longer range. The type was to be designated as Su-30MKK (\"Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Kitayski\" \u2013 Modernised Commercial for China).<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nFinal details of the agreement were settled during the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|Zhuhai Air Show]] in 1998. The official agreement was signed in Russia by the Chinese Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] in March 1999. That same month, a \"Bort 501 Blue\" prototype made its first flight at the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute|Zhukovsky Air Base]].<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nIn November 2000, \"Bort 502 Blue\" attended the Zhuhai Air Show and a month later the first batch of ten Su-30MKK was delivered. A second batch of 10 were delivered on 21 August 2001, with the third batch of 18 following in December.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nIn July 2001, Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]] and his Russian counterpart, [[Vladimir Putin]], signed a deal for a further 38 aircraft.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nIn the year 2002, the two countries were negotiating on the purchase of the Su-30MK2 for the [[People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force]] (PLANAF). The variant had a revised weapon control system for the [[Kh-31]]A air-to-surface missile. A contract for 24 aircraft to be built by KnAAPO was signed in early 2003. All were delivered in 2004.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\nSu-30MKK shares compatibility with [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] in terms of hardware, but in terms of software, Su-30MKK differs from [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] (Flanker-E) on a much greater scale in comparison to Indian [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] because of different mission requirements by China. The Flanker family aircraft has the problem of the reduction of maximum [[g-force]] level being decreased to 7g from the 9g at speed between Mach 0.7 to Mach 0.9, and this problem was completely solved on Su-30MKK by adopting new measures. According to the Sukhoi Design Bureau, Su-30MKK is the first of the Flanker family to achieve it after [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] / [[Sukhoi Su-37|37]] (Flanker-E/F) and [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]]. Higher percentage of [[composite material]] is used for Su-30MKK in comparison to the original [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su-30MK]]. In addition, new aluminum alloy were used to replace the old type used on Su-30MK for weight reduction. The twin rudders mainly made of [[carbon fiber]] composite material were larger on Su-30MKK in comparison to that of the original Su-30MK, but contrary to what was once erroneously claimed by some western sources, Sukhoi Design Bureau revealed later that the increased space in the rudders were used for additional fuel tanks, instead of larger communication [[UHF]] antenna. The capacity of the fuel tanks in the wings is also increased. A twin nose landing gear of size 620&nbsp;mm x 180&nbsp;mm has replaced the single nose landing gear of size 680&nbsp;mm x 260&nbsp;mm used on Su-30MK to accommodate the increased weight. The maximum take-off weight and weapon load are increased to 38 tons and 12 tons respectively, but this extreme limit is often avoided by taking off at lighter weight. It was rumored that the Chinese pilots were not as experienced as Russian test pilots when operating at this extreme limits, which contributed to the crashes at least partially. The original K-36 [[ejection seat]] on Su-30MK is replaced by [[NPP Zvezda K-36|K-36M]] ejection seat for Su-30MKK.\n\n===Fuel capacity===\nIn addition to the newly added fuel tanks in the rudders capacity totaling 280&nbsp;kg, there are four main fuel tanks. No. 1 tank with capacity totaling 3,150&nbsp;kg is in the front, No. 2 tank with capacity totaling 4,150&nbsp;kg is in the middle, No. 3 tank with capacity totaling 1,053&nbsp;kg is in the rear, and No. 4 tank with capacity totaling 1,552&nbsp;kg is located in the wings. During aerial refueling, the maximum capacity of Su-30MKK is receiving up to 2,300 liters per minute. The altitude of refueling is limited to 2&nbsp;km to 6&nbsp;km, and the speed is limited to 450\u2013550&nbsp;km/h. Aerial refueling probe is located in front of cockpit on the left, and the design is capable of night refueling.\n\n===Engine===\nThe main power plants are two AL-31F engines that provide great maneuverability and thrust. Range can be extended with the [[aerial refueling]] probe. Domestic Chinese resources have claimed that the Chinese engine [[WS-10]] with higher mean time between overhaul can also be used, but this is yet to be confirmed by the official sources and sources outside China. The average [[Mean time between failures]] of AL-31F is only slightly above 500 hours, significantly lower than its western counterparts, the same problem reportedly encountered by Indian Air Force for its [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] fleet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Avionics===\nAccording to [[Sukhoi]] Design Bureau, many of the new avionics and upgrades of current avionics were specially developed to meet the Chinese requirement, and subsequently used on other members of the Flanker family, including the more advanced versions that appeared later, and this was mainly due to the fact that the funding for Su-30MKK was readily available in comparison to others. The primary contractors / system integrator for Su-30MKK avionics was RPKB Instrumentation Design Bureau headquartered at [[Ramenskoye, Moscow Oblast|Ramenskoye]], and many new measures were adopted to meet the Chinese requirement, such as the [[open architecture software]] design. The development of avionics for the Su-30MKK was also assisted by 12 Ukrainian factories, based in Kiev.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2006/ukraine-060614-rianovosti03.htm |title=Obituary for Ukrainian defense industry |access-date=4 July 2008 |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204111942/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2006/ukraine-060614-rianovosti03.htm |archive-date=4 December 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\nThe encrypted [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] communication radio of Su-30MKK has a maximum range in excess of 400&nbsp;km, while the encrypted [[High frequency|HF]] communication radio of Su-30MKK has a maximum range in excess of 1,500&nbsp;km, and all can be used for both air-to-air or air-to-ground two-way communications. Su-30MKK is the first of Flanker family to be equipped with TKS-2 C3 system, which is capable of simultaneously commanding and controlling up to 15 aircraft with such system, and the [[air-to-air missile]]s launched by these aircraft. According to the developer of the system, Russkaya Avionika JSC, the encrypted two-way communication [[Command, control, and communications]] system can be either [[Ground-controlled interception|commanded or controlled by ground stations]], or act as the command/control center for other aircraft. The system is claimed by the Russian developer as a huge leap forward in comparison to the similar rudimentary system on [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], which is only capable of one way communication. The new system is also the first among Russian system that is capable of forming a [[local area network]] like similar system on American [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]].\n\n====Electronic warfare systems====\nRussian sources have claimed that the [[electronic warfare]] systems of Su-30MKK utilizes the latest technologies available in Russia and the [[radar warning receiver]]s are so effective that the information provided by [[Radar warning receiver|RWR]] alone would be enough to provide targeting information for [[Kh-31]]P [[anti-radiation missile]] without using other detection systems on board, though information can also be provided by L-150 [[ELINT]] system, which can be used in conjunction with Kh-31P. The maximum range of the RWR is termed at several hundred kilometers, and based on the 200&nbsp;km maximum range of the [[Kh-31]]P [[anti-radiation missile]], the maximum should be at least that much. The threat information obtained from RWRs can be either provided on the [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s (showing the most dangerous four targets) for the pilot in the manual mode, or be used automatically. The active jamming pods are mounted on the wing tips, and the APP-50 decoy launcher is mounted near the tail cone with 96 decoys of different kinds. Domestic Chinese electronic warfare systems including BM/KG300G and [[KZ900]] can also be carried after modification of onboard system, but such modification was neither part of the original deal nor the upgrade deal with Russians, instead, this was implemented indigenously by Chinese themselves during the incremental upgrades.\n\n====Flight control====\nThe [[fly by wire]] (FBW) control with quadruple redundancy designed by Russkaya Avionika is the same system used for the Su-30MKI. Russian sources have confirmed the claims of domestic Chinese sources that an indigenous Chinese system developed is near its completion and it will be used to replace the original Russian system. However, this has yet to be confirmed by western sources and official Chinese governmental sources, which only acknowledged in the 6th Zhuhai Airshow that domestic [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) control with quadruple redundancy is developed to accommodate domestic engines, but nothing was mentioned about whether the domestic system and engines would be used on future Su-30MKK upgrades.\n\n====Flight instruments====\nThe Su-30MKK features a [[glass cockpit]] of Russkaya Avionika JSC, with each pilot having two large multi-function displays, rear pilot displays arranged in a rather unconventional way: one atop of the other. Two {{convert|178|x|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-9 colour [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s are located in the front seat, a single MFI-9 and a {{convert|204|x|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-10 color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s are located in the rear seat. The [[head-up display]] (HUD) is also developed by Russkaya Avonika JSC, designated as SILS-30.\n\n====Helmet mounted sight====\nThe original ASP-PVD-21 series [[helmet mounted sight]] (HMS) with only limited field of view (FoV) was replaced by more advanced Sura-K HMS system, but Chinese have been replacing the Russian HMS with more advanced domestic system. Publicized photos and video clips from the official Chinese governmental sources such as [[CCTV-7]] in 2007 and PLA pictorial magazine have confirmed the western claims of Chinese is replacing the original Russian helmet mounted sights (HMS) with more capable{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} domestic ones.\n\n====Mission computer====\nThe new mission computer was jointly developed by the Russian National Aeronautical System Science Research Academy and Russkaya Avionika JSC, designated as MVK, capable of performing ten billion [[FLOPS]]. All avionics on board is built to [[MIL-STD-1553]] standard. There are four computers based on Baguet-55 series processor, one for central avionics control, two for information display, and one for fire control.\n\n====Navigation====\nThe integrated navigational systems designated as PNS-10, incorporating the A737 subsystem. The system is capable of utilizing both the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]], but it is rumored that Chinese is developing a similar system to add the capability to utilize domestic [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.\n\n====Airborne radar====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nAirborne radar on board Su-30MKK has been continuously upgraded and a total of three were confirmed so far, all of which are controlled by the RLPK-27VE integrated radar targeting system, developed from the RLPK-27 system of the single seat [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]]. Both systems are designed by Viktor Grishin of the [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP), and is compatible with various radar and weaponry systems.\n*N001VEP radar: The first 20 Su-30MKK have an N001VEP [[Passive electronically scanned array]] (PESA) [[fire-control radar]] by the Chief designer Viktor Grishin of the [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP) with a range up to 100&nbsp;km, able to concurrently track 10 targets, and engage four air targets or two ground targets of the 10 tracked. The [[N001VEP]] is developed from the earlier [[N001VE]] radar designed by the same designer, which was used on the Chinese [[Shenyang J-11#Variants|J-11A]]. The original Baguet series processor of the N001VE radar is replaced by its successor Baguet-55 series. Like its predecessor, the new radar has incorporated the [[moving target indication]] (MTI) and mapping capabilities, and the capability to detect low flying or hovering helicopters. The scan sector of it is 120 degrees while the elevation is 110 degrees.\n*[[Zhuk (radar)]]-MS radar: From the 21st Su-30MKK on, the N001VEP radar is replaced by the Zhuk-MS (Beetle-MS) fire control radar of Tikhomirov (NIIP)'s competitor, [[Phazotron]] (NIIR), which also adopts a slotted [[planar array]] antenna like N001VEP radar. The new radar has longer range coverage (up to 150&nbsp;km) and is able to guide a greater variety of weapons systems. The number of targets that can be engaged is identical to that of the N001VEP radar, but the number that can be simultaneously tracked has been doubled to 20. The Zhuk (Beetle)-MS radar is an improvement of the earlier Zhuk (Beetle) radar designed for Su-27 and MiG-29 upgrades, and in comparison to the original Zhuk radar, the Zhuk-MS has the following improvements in addition to increased range and number of targets tracked/engaged:\n** The antenna diameter is increased to 960&nbsp;mm from the original 680&nbsp;mm of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** The peak power is increased to 6&nbsp;kW from the original 5&nbsp;kW of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** The average power is increased to 1.5&nbsp;kW from the original 1&nbsp;kW of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** Contrary to many erroneous claims, Zhuk-MS is not a [[phased array radar]], but a slotted planar array antenna.\n*Zhuk-MSE radar: The Zhuk-MS has been replaced by its successor, Zhuk-MSE in the incremental upgrades of Su-30MKK, and previous Zhuk-MS are being upgraded to the Zhuk-MSE level. In comparison to the predecessor most performance parameters remain the same, but the number of ground targets that can be simultaneously engaged is increased to four from the original two. Like Zhuk-MS, this radar has also been erroneously reported to be a [[phased array]] radar when in fact, it utilizes a slotted planar array antenna. The designer [[Phazotron]] has claimed the new radar has better [[Electronic counter-countermeasures|ECCM]] capabilities than earlier models.\n\nAt the 6th Zhuhai Airshow held in 2006, Russian designers at a news conference revealed to Chinese journalists that they had been working with the Chinese to develop a [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar to upgrade [[Su-27]]SK and Su-30MKKs, but stopped short of releasing any additional information. These Russian radar designers were [[Phazotron]] employees, not [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design|Tikhomirov]], the usual radar supplier for the Flanker family. Some domestic Chinese media have claimed the [[phased array]] radar is the Zhuk-MSF, but this has yet to be confirmed.\nIt is also possible that the Chinese may use the same radar used on its newest J-11b's radar which will significantly increase Su-30MKK's performance, because J-11B's radar will increase the Su-30MKK's radar range up to 350&nbsp;km{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and allow it to engage up to four air-to-air and four ground targets. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n====Fire control system====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe fire control system on board integrates the [[radar]], optronics, helmet-mounted sight, [[electronic warfare]] gears including [[radar warning receiver]]s, and [[data link]]s. The system consists of two subsystems: the SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem and the SUV-P air-to-ground subsystem.\n*SUV-VEP: this air-to-air subsystem is capable of controlling six [[air-to-air missile]]s, which is greater than the maximum number of targets the airborne radar on board Su-30MKK can simultaneously engage, thus leaving rooms for radar improvement, which would be later exploited when the new [[passive electronically scanned array]] radars have been installed on Su-30MK2. The SUV-VEP subsystem is also capable of controlling air-to-sea missions, and the fire control of [[Kh-31]]A and [[Kh-35]] [[anti-ship missile]]s are usually provided by SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem instead of SUV-P air-to-ground subsystem. The subsystem of SUV-VEP system includes four major portions:\n**SEI-31-10 Integrated Display system: Used to control [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s.\n**OEPS-30 optronic (electro-optical) detection system: Chinese call this system optronic radar system, and it consists of two major components:\n***OLS-30 (52Sh) [[Infra-red search and track]] weighing 200&nbsp;kg includes laser and IR sensors. In comparison to its predecessor OLS-27 (Izdeliye 36Sh) on Su-27, the IR detection range nearly doubled to > 90&nbsp;km from the original 50&nbsp;km. The range of laser range finder is increased to > 10&nbsp;km from the original 6&nbsp;km.\n***Sura-K helmet mounted system (HMS): The field of view (FoV) is greatly increased to +/- 60 degrees in comparison to the +/- 8 degrees of the ASP-PVD-21 HMS originally used on Su-27.\n**[[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] and airborne radar are also controlled by SUV-VEP system.\n*SUV-P: this air-to-ground subsystem utilizes identical hardware of SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem, but with a different processing requirement. This subsystem is mainly used for [[air-to-surface missile]]s such as [[Kh-59]], and acts as an interface between the system on board the aircraft and the designated targeting pods of the [[air-to-surface missile]]s that can not be controlled directly by the onboard avionics. The primary subsystem of SUV-P system is SUO-30PK subsystem and A-737 satellite navigational subsystem.\n**SUO-30PK weaponry control subsystem: though [[Kh-31]] is often controlled by SUV-VEP air-to-air system, it can also be controlled via SUV-P system via SUO-30PK subsystem, which can also control L-150 ELINT system. SUO-30PK system also controls other missiles such as Kh-59, an air-to-ground missiles that is controlled via Tekon targeting system in the APK-9E pod. Other SUO-30PK subsystem is developed by Aviation Automation Design bureau at [[Kursk]], and it can be used to control unguided air-to-ground weaponry.\nBoth the SUV-VEP and SUV-P systems were adopted to upgrade the single seat Su-27SK in Chinese inventory, and a joint team of [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP) and State Instrumentation Plant at [[Ryazan]] was named as the primary contractor. The modified SUV-VEP system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-VE, while the modified SUV-P system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-PE. The original analog dial indicator on flight dashboard of Su-27SK were replaced by two 6 in x 6 in MFI-10-6M and a MFIP-6 [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s. According to Russian claim, over 60 Chinese Su-27SK have been upgraded by the end of 2006.\n\n===Su-30MK2===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nWith its improved avionics, the MK2 was designed for more dedicated use as a maritime strike aircraft, thus these aircraft ordered by China are currently being operated by the Naval Air Force. The MK2 also features a better [[C4ISTAR]] (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) abilities than the MKKs.\n\n====Mission computer====\nThe original MVK mission computer is replaced by its successor MVK-RL, with greater capability.\n\n====Communications====\nThe TKS-2 C3 system is replaced by the follow-on TSIMSS-1 digital system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=992&zoneid=7 |title=China Debuts Aegis Destroyers |date=27 June 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220223018/http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=992&zoneid=7 |archive-date=20 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Flight instruments====\nThe two {{convert|178|x|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-9 colour [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s in the front cockpit and the MFI-9 and the {{convert|204|x|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-10 color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s in the rear cockpit are replaced with four 158&nbsp;mm x 211&nbsp;mm MFI-10-5 [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s. The configuration of the new displays remains the same as that of Su-30MKK.\n\n====Optronics====\nOne of the important avionic upgrades of Su-30MK2 is the incorporation of several electro-optical ([[optronic]]s) pods, a capability that is added to earlier Su-30MKK during upgrades. Two types of Russian optronic pods are sold to China for Su-30MK2, but the open architecture and other advanced designs enabled the aircraft to carry domestic optronic pods as well. This capability of Su-30MK2 has been added to the original Su-30MKKs during the incremental upgrades. The Russian optronic pods included:\n*Optronic pod \"Sapsan-E\": Sapsan ([[peregrine falcon]])-E targeting pod developed by the Ural Optical Machinery Plant weighs 250&nbsp;kg, with length of 3 m and diameter of 0.39 m. Field of view is from +10 degrees to \u221215 degrees, and the system includes TV camera and laser designators. This system is designed to supplement the OEPS-30MK-E optronic system mounted in the nose of the aircraft.\n*M400 reconnaissance pod: M400 reconnaissance pod developed by the Canopy Design Bureau is a large pod mounted between two engines. In comparison to Sapsan-E targeting pod, there is different equipment in the M400 reconnaissance pod: TV/[[Thermographic camera]]s, optical camera and [[Side looking airborne radar]]. The side-looking radar has a maximum range in excess of 100&nbsp;km with resolution of 2 metres, while the maximum range for both IR and TV cameras are in excess of 70&nbsp;km. The resolution of the TV/IR camera is 0.3-metre and 0.4-metre for the optical camera. The system can also be used to detect the blind spot behind the aircraft to provide targeting information for rearward-firing [[air-to-air missile]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, but this capability has not been utilized by the Chinese yet. The system is also capable of locking on sea targets.\n*Domestic Chinese optronics including [[FILAT]] and [[Blue Sky (navigation pod)]] can also be carried after modification of onboard system. Just like the incorporation of domestic Chinese electronic warfare pods such as BM/KG300G and [[KZ900]] to Su-30MKK, such modification was neither part of the original deal nor the upgrade deal with Russians, instead, this was implemented indigenously by the Chinese themselves during the incremental upgrades. According to Chinese claims, the domestic upgrade of Su-30MKK/MK2 were much smoother and easier than that of earlier [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27SK]], thanks to the western [[MIL-STD-1553]] standard Russian adopted for Su-30MKK series.\n\n====Airborne radar====\nIn 2000, China placed an order of [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar named Sokol (Falcon), designed by [[Phazotron]], while the radar was still under development, it is reported that China had either partially funded or joined the development, but this can not be confirmed. All twenty units were delivered in 2004 after the development completed at the end of 2003, and the radars are installed on the Su-30MK2. The maximum range, average and peak power of Sokol radar remain the same as that of Zhuk-MSE radar on Su-30MKK, but the maximum number of targets it can simultaneously track actually decreased by 40%, from the original 20 to 12. However, the number of targets it can simultaneously engage is increased to six from the original four, thus fully utilizing the capability of the SUV-VEP subsystem of the onboard fire control system. The diameter of the antenna array is increased to 980&nbsp;mm from the 960&nbsp;mm of Zhuk-MS/MSE. The scan sector of the radar is 170 degrees and the elevation of the scan is from \u221240 degrees to +56 degrees. The radar has three receivers and a gain of 37&nbsp;dB. When used against surface targets like a destroyer, the maximum range is doubled to 300&nbsp;km, same as that of American [[AN/APG-68]]. There is not any confirmation for any follow-on orders of Sokol radar and unlike the capability optronic pod, this radar capability is not known to be added to the earlier Su-30MKKs during the incremental upgrades.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Russia had authorized the export of Pero [[passive electronically scanned array]] [[radar]] designed by Tikhomirov, to China. The Pero antenna can be easily integrated into the existing N001VEP radar system with no significant modification by simply replacing the original slotted planar array, and thus results in increased performance. The Pero upgrade, lets the radar simultaneously engage 6 aerial targets, or 4 ground targets. The radar with Pero antenna is named as Panda radar. China, however, did not accept the offer when Russia offered the Pero upgrade package because Tikhomirov's competitor [[Phazotron]] offered China a brand new phased array radar that supposedly performed better, rumored to be Zhuk-MSF. In addition to the easy of integration, the advantage of Pero [[passive electronically scanned array]] equipped Panda radar was its weight. All other radars offered for Su-30MK2 upgrade increase weight significantly that the center of the gravity of the aircraft is altered, resulting in the need to modify the airframe and redesign the flight control system. Such problems does not exist if Panda radar is adopted because it only increases the weight by a mere 20&nbsp;kg, which will be compensated by the redesign of SILS-30 HUD to reduce its weight by 20&nbsp;kg, thus balancing out the weight increase of the radar. This claim of Timkhomirov design bureau is confirmed by both the Sukhoi design bureau and Russkaya Avionika bureau, which claimed to media reporters at 2006 Zhuhai Airshow in China that such modification had already been successfully completed. China, however, had not made a final decision by the end of 2007, and many Russian and Chinese sources have claimed that domestic Chinese HUDs of Western origin perform better and weigh much less, and China thus planned to adopt their own avionics in the next incremental upgrade, but such claims have yet to be confirmed by western sources and official sources of Chinese and Russian governments.\n\nIn response, Tikhomirov subsequently offered China its N-011M Bars [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar, the most powerful Russian airborne radar on any of its exported aircraft, but China once again rejected the offer. Many claimed that the reason for the rejection was that Chinese discovered the same problem India had during the evaluation of the radar: although the N-011M Bars [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar offered longer range and better resistance to jamming, it had the problem of accurately and correct identifying targets at long range, while others claims China simply did not want the same system used by India. However, both claims contradict with the official explanation of the Chinese government: the new radar weighs more than 650&nbsp;kg and caused the center of gravity of the aircraft to alter significantly, thus greatly degraded the aerodynamic performance and weapon payload arrangement of the Su-30MKK, which is far less adaptable to the new heavy radar than [[Su-30MKI]], because the two were based on two totally different airframes, a fact that is confirmed by ''Jane's all the World's Aircraft''. If the new radar was to be adopted, canards must be added and flight control software must be also modified for Su-30MKK just to remain the same level of performance as before, and thus, in addition to paying for the more expensive new radars, a huge amount of money must be spent in upgrading the aircraft as well.\n\n===Su-30MK3===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe MK3 was to possibly feature either the Phazotron Zhuk-MSF phased array radar, or a new \"Panda\" radar developed by Tikhomirov, which is based on Pero passive phased array radar, both were rumored to be under Chinese evaluation. Either radar would significantly improve the Su-30s air target detection range to 190&nbsp;km and surface detection range at 300&nbsp;km. It is uncertain whether the PLAN or PLAAF would order any of these aircraft, despite their significant advantages with their advanced radars. Therefore, if these radars passed Chinese tests, they will likely to be retrofitted to earlier MKK and MK2 and even possibly [[Shenyang J-11]] due to uncertain status of MK3 project.\n\nIn January 2007, Russia confirmed that the newest Irbis-E (Snow leopard-E) phased array radar in Russia's inventory, developed by Tikhomirov, was offered to China. However, it is highly unlikely that China will adopt this newest Russian airborne radar because all models of the Su-30 series can only provide half of the power required for the 5&nbsp;kW rated radar, and currently, only [[Sukhoi Su-35]] and [[Sukhoi Su-37]] have enough power to support this newest Russian airborne radar. Purchasing Irbis-E phased array radar would lock China into yet another deal with Russia to upgrade its Su-30MKK fleet that would greatly increase the cost, because China currently lacks the ability to do so by itself, or is forced to pay even higher prices to buy the Su-35 or Su-37.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Su-30MKK operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Sukhoi Su-30MKK operators in blue]]\n\n===Current operators===\n;{{Flagu|People's Republic of China}}\n* [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] had 73 Su-30MKK fighters in service in 2010.<ref name=\"iiss_militarybalance2010\">{{cite book |editor-last=Hacket |editor-first=James |title=The Military Balance 2010 |publisher=[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] |year=2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Hacket |editor-first=James |title=The Military Balance 2010 |publisher=[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] |year=2010}}</ref> 76 were delivered in 2000\u20132003.

As defensive orientated tactics were dropped and more aggressive stances were adopted, the requirement for a heavy fighter with a large combat radius and a [[precision-guided munition]] employment capability was placed upon the political leadership of the People's Republic of China.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nDuring a visit to the Russian Federation at the end of 1996, Chinese Premier [[Li Peng]] signed an agreement worth US$1.8 billion to purchase 38 advanced [[Multirole combat aircraft]]. Technical negotiations started right away.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nSukhoi saw enormous potential to meet China's requirement with its Su-30MK, while incorporating technology from the Su-27M, to develop a new fighter that preserved the type's iconic tall and thick [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer]] fins as fuel tanks for longer range. The type was to be designated as Su-30MKK (\"Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Kitayski\" \u2013 Modernised Commercial for China).<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nFinal details of the agreement were settled during the [[China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition|Zhuhai Air Show]] in 1998. The official agreement was signed in Russia by the Chinese Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] in March 1999. That same month, a \"Bort 501 Blue\" prototype made its first flight at the [[Gromov Flight Research Institute|Zhukovsky Air Base]].<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\nIn November 2000, \"Bort 502 Blue\" attended the Zhuhai Air Show and a month later the first batch of ten Su-30MKK was delivered.

The variant had a revised weapon control system for the [[Kh-31]]A air-to-surface missile. A contract for 24 aircraft to be built by KnAAPO was signed in early 2003. All were delivered in 2004.<ref name=\"Flanker by name\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2011}}\nSu-30MKK shares compatibility with [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] in terms of hardware, but in terms of software, Su-30MKK differs from [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] (Flanker-E) on a much greater scale in comparison to Indian [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] because of different mission requirements by China. The Flanker family aircraft has the problem of the reduction of maximum [[g-force]] level being decreased to 7g from the 9g at speed between Mach 0.7 to Mach 0.9, and this problem was completely solved on Su-30MKK by adopting new measures. According to the Sukhoi Design Bureau, Su-30MKK is the first of the Flanker family to achieve it after [[Sukhoi Su-35|Su-35]] / [[Sukhoi Su-37|37]] (Flanker-E/F) and [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]]. Higher percentage of [[composite material]] is used for Su-30MKK in comparison to the original [[Sukhoi Su-30|Su-30MK]]. In addition, new aluminum alloy were used to replace the old type used on Su-30MK for weight reduction. The twin rudders mainly made of [[carbon fiber]] composite material were larger on Su-30MKK in comparison to that of the original Su-30MK, but contrary to what was once erroneously claimed by some western sources, Sukhoi Design Bureau revealed later that the increased space in the rudders were used for additional fuel tanks, instead of larger communication [[UHF]] antenna. The capacity of the fuel tanks in the wings is also increased. A twin nose landing gear of size 620&nbsp;mm x 180&nbsp;mm has replaced the single nose landing gear of size 680&nbsp;mm x 260&nbsp;mm used on Su-30MK to accommodate the increased weight. The maximum take-off weight and weapon load are increased to 38 tons and 12 tons respectively, but this extreme limit is often avoided by taking off at lighter weight. It was rumored that the Chinese pilots were not as experienced as Russian test pilots when operating at this extreme limits, which contributed to the crashes at least partially. The original K-36 [[ejection seat]] on Su-30MK is replaced by [[NPP Zvezda K-36|K-36M]] ejection seat for Su-30MKK.\n\n===Fuel capacity===\nIn addition to the newly added fuel tanks in the rudders capacity totaling 280&nbsp;kg, there are four main fuel tanks. No. 1 tank with capacity totaling 3,150&nbsp;kg is in the front, No. 2 tank with capacity totaling 4,150&nbsp;kg is in the middle, No. 3 tank with capacity totaling 1,053&nbsp;kg is in the rear, and No. 4 tank with capacity totaling 1,552&nbsp;kg is located in the wings. During aerial refueling, the maximum capacity of Su-30MKK is receiving up to 2,300 liters per minute. The altitude of refueling is limited to 2&nbsp;km to 6&nbsp;km, and the speed is limited to 450\u2013550&nbsp;km/h. Aerial refueling probe is located in front of cockpit on the left, and the design is capable of night refueling.\n\n===Engine===\nThe main power plants are two AL-31F engines that provide great maneuverability and thrust. Range can be extended with the [[aerial refueling]] probe. Domestic Chinese resources have claimed that the Chinese engine [[WS-10]] with higher mean time between overhaul can also be used, but this is yet to be confirmed by the official sources and sources outside China. The average [[Mean time between failures]] of AL-31F is only slightly above 500 hours, significantly lower than its western counterparts, the same problem reportedly encountered by Indian Air Force for its [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] fleet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Avionics===\nAccording to [[Sukhoi]] Design Bureau, many of the new avionics and upgrades of current avionics were specially developed to meet the Chinese requirement, and subsequently used on other members of the Flanker family, including the more advanced versions that appeared later, and this was mainly due to the fact that the funding for Su-30MKK was readily available in comparison to others. The primary contractors / system integrator for Su-30MKK avionics was RPKB Instrumentation Design Bureau headquartered at [[Ramenskoye, Moscow Oblast|Ramenskoye]], and many new measures were adopted to meet the Chinese requirement, such as the [[open architecture software]] design. The development of avionics for the Su-30MKK was also assisted by 12 Ukrainian factories, based in Kiev.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2006/ukraine-060614-rianovosti03.htm |title=Obituary for Ukrainian defense industry |access-date=4 July 2008 |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204111942/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/ukraine/2006/ukraine-060614-rianovosti03.htm |archive-date=4 December 2008 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\nThe encrypted [[VHF]]/[[UHF]] communication radio of Su-30MKK has a maximum range in excess of 400&nbsp;km, while the encrypted [[High frequency|HF]] communication radio of Su-30MKK has a maximum range in excess of 1,500&nbsp;km, and all can be used for both air-to-air or air-to-ground two-way communications. Su-30MKK is the first of Flanker family to be equipped with TKS-2 C3 system, which is capable of simultaneously commanding and controlling up to 15 aircraft with such system, and the [[air-to-air missile]]s launched by these aircraft. According to the developer of the system, Russkaya Avionika JSC, the encrypted two-way communication [[Command, control, and communications]] system can be either [[Ground-controlled interception|commanded or controlled by ground stations]], or act as the command/control center for other aircraft. The system is claimed by the Russian developer as a huge leap forward in comparison to the similar rudimentary system on [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]], which is only capable of one way communication. The new system is also the first among Russian system that is capable of forming a [[local area network]] like similar system on American [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]].\n\n====Electronic warfare systems====\nRussian sources have claimed that the [[electronic warfare]] systems of Su-30MKK utilizes the latest technologies available in Russia and the [[radar warning receiver]]s are so effective that the information provided by [[Radar warning receiver|RWR]] alone would be enough to provide targeting information for [[Kh-31]]P [[anti-radiation missile]] without using other detection systems on board, though information can also be provided by L-150 [[ELINT]] system, which can be used in conjunction with Kh-31P. The maximum range of the RWR is termed at several hundred kilometers, and based on the 200&nbsp;km maximum range of the [[Kh-31]]P [[anti-radiation missile]], the maximum should be at least that much. The threat information obtained from RWRs can be either provided on the [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s (showing the most dangerous four targets) for the pilot in the manual mode, or be used automatically. The active jamming pods are mounted on the wing tips, and the APP-50 decoy launcher is mounted near the tail cone with 96 decoys of different kinds. Domestic Chinese electronic warfare systems including BM/KG300G and [[KZ900]] can also be carried after modification of onboard system, but such modification was neither part of the original deal nor the upgrade deal with Russians, instead, this was implemented indigenously by Chinese themselves during the incremental upgrades.\n\n====Flight control====\nThe [[fly by wire]] (FBW) control with quadruple redundancy designed by Russkaya Avionika is the same system used for the Su-30MKI. Russian sources have confirmed the claims of domestic Chinese sources that an indigenous Chinese system developed is near its completion and it will be used to replace the original Russian system. However, this has yet to be confirmed by western sources and official Chinese governmental sources, which only acknowledged in the 6th Zhuhai Airshow that domestic [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) control with quadruple redundancy is developed to accommodate domestic engines, but nothing was mentioned about whether the domestic system and engines would be used on future Su-30MKK upgrades.\n\n====Flight instruments====\nThe Su-30MKK features a [[glass cockpit]] of Russkaya Avionika JSC, with each pilot having two large multi-function displays, rear pilot displays arranged in a rather unconventional way: one atop of the other. Two {{convert|178|x|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-9 colour [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s are located in the front seat, a single MFI-9 and a {{convert|204|x|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-10 color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s are located in the rear seat. The [[head-up display]] (HUD) is also developed by Russkaya Avonika JSC, designated as SILS-30.\n\n====Helmet mounted sight====\nThe original ASP-PVD-21 series [[helmet mounted sight]] (HMS) with only limited field of view (FoV) was replaced by more advanced Sura-K HMS system, but Chinese have been replacing the Russian HMS with more advanced domestic system. Publicized photos and video clips from the official Chinese governmental sources such as [[CCTV-7]] in 2007 and PLA pictorial magazine have confirmed the western claims of Chinese is replacing the original Russian helmet mounted sights (HMS) with more capable{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} domestic ones.\n\n====Mission computer====\nThe new mission computer was jointly developed by the Russian National Aeronautical System Science Research Academy and Russkaya Avionika JSC, designated as MVK, capable of performing ten billion [[FLOPS]]. All avionics on board is built to [[MIL-STD-1553]] standard. There are four computers based on Baguet-55 series processor, one for central avionics control, two for information display, and one for fire control.\n\n====Navigation====\nThe integrated navigational systems designated as PNS-10, incorporating the A737 subsystem. The system is capable of utilizing both the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]], but it is rumored that Chinese is developing a similar system to add the capability to utilize domestic [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.\n\n====Airborne radar====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nAirborne radar on board Su-30MKK has been continuously upgraded and a total of three were confirmed so far, all of which are controlled by the RLPK-27VE integrated radar targeting system, developed from the RLPK-27 system of the single seat [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27]]. Both systems are designed by Viktor Grishin of the [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP), and is compatible with various radar and weaponry systems.\n*N001VEP radar: The first 20 Su-30MKK have an N001VEP [[Passive electronically scanned array]] (PESA) [[fire-control radar]] by the Chief designer Viktor Grishin of the [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP) with a range up to 100&nbsp;km, able to concurrently track 10 targets, and engage four air targets or two ground targets of the 10 tracked. The [[N001VEP]] is developed from the earlier [[N001VE]] radar designed by the same designer, which was used on the Chinese [[Shenyang J-11#Variants|J-11A]]. The original Baguet series processor of the N001VE radar is replaced by its successor Baguet-55 series. Like its predecessor, the new radar has incorporated the [[moving target indication]] (MTI) and mapping capabilities, and the capability to detect low flying or hovering helicopters. The scan sector of it is 120 degrees while the elevation is 110 degrees.\n*[[Zhuk (radar)]]-MS radar: From the 21st Su-30MKK on, the N001VEP radar is replaced by the Zhuk-MS (Beetle-MS) fire control radar of Tikhomirov (NIIP)'s competitor, [[Phazotron]] (NIIR), which also adopts a slotted [[planar array]] antenna like N001VEP radar. The new radar has longer range coverage (up to 150&nbsp;km) and is able to guide a greater variety of weapons systems. The number of targets that can be engaged is identical to that of the N001VEP radar, but the number that can be simultaneously tracked has been doubled to 20. The Zhuk (Beetle)-MS radar is an improvement of the earlier Zhuk (Beetle) radar designed for Su-27 and MiG-29 upgrades, and in comparison to the original Zhuk radar, the Zhuk-MS has the following improvements in addition to increased range and number of targets tracked/engaged:\n** The antenna diameter is increased to 960&nbsp;mm from the original 680&nbsp;mm of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** The peak power is increased to 6&nbsp;kW from the original 5&nbsp;kW of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** The average power is increased to 1.5&nbsp;kW from the original 1&nbsp;kW of Zhuk (Beetle) radar\n** Contrary to many erroneous claims, Zhuk-MS is not a [[phased array radar]], but a slotted planar array antenna.\n*Zhuk-MSE radar: The Zhuk-MS has been replaced by its successor, Zhuk-MSE in the incremental upgrades of Su-30MKK, and previous Zhuk-MS are being upgraded to the Zhuk-MSE level. In comparison to the predecessor most performance parameters remain the same, but the number of ground targets that can be simultaneously engaged is increased to four from the original two. Like Zhuk-MS, this radar has also been erroneously reported to be a [[phased array]] radar when in fact, it utilizes a slotted planar array antenna. The designer [[Phazotron]] has claimed the new radar has better [[Electronic counter-countermeasures|ECCM]] capabilities than earlier models.\n\nAt the 6th Zhuhai Airshow held in 2006, Russian designers at a news conference revealed to Chinese journalists that they had been working with the Chinese to develop a [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar to upgrade [[Su-27]]SK and Su-30MKKs, but stopped short of releasing any additional information. These Russian radar designers were [[Phazotron]] employees, not [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design|Tikhomirov]], the usual radar supplier for the Flanker family. Some domestic Chinese media have claimed the [[phased array]] radar is the Zhuk-MSF, but this has yet to be confirmed.\nIt is also possible that the Chinese may use the same radar used on its newest J-11b's radar which will significantly increase Su-30MKK's performance, because J-11B's radar will increase the Su-30MKK's radar range up to 350&nbsp;km{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and allow it to engage up to four air-to-air and four ground targets. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n====Fire control system====\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe fire control system on board integrates the [[radar]], optronics, helmet-mounted sight, [[electronic warfare]] gears including [[radar warning receiver]]s, and [[data link]]s. The system consists of two subsystems: the SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem and the SUV-P air-to-ground subsystem.\n*SUV-VEP: this air-to-air subsystem is capable of controlling six [[air-to-air missile]]s, which is greater than the maximum number of targets the airborne radar on board Su-30MKK can simultaneously engage, thus leaving rooms for radar improvement, which would be later exploited when the new [[passive electronically scanned array]] radars have been installed on Su-30MK2. The SUV-VEP subsystem is also capable of controlling air-to-sea missions, and the fire control of [[Kh-31]]A and [[Kh-35]] [[anti-ship missile]]s are usually provided by SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem instead of SUV-P air-to-ground subsystem. The subsystem of SUV-VEP system includes four major portions:\n**SEI-31-10 Integrated Display system: Used to control [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s.\n**OEPS-30 optronic (electro-optical) detection system: Chinese call this system optronic radar system, and it consists of two major components:\n***OLS-30 (52Sh) [[Infra-red search and track]] weighing 200&nbsp;kg includes laser and IR sensors. In comparison to its predecessor OLS-27 (Izdeliye 36Sh) on Su-27, the IR detection range nearly doubled to > 90&nbsp;km from the original 50&nbsp;km. The range of laser range finder is increased to > 10&nbsp;km from the original 6&nbsp;km.\n***Sura-K helmet mounted system (HMS): The field of view (FoV) is greatly increased to +/- 60 degrees in comparison to the +/- 8 degrees of the ASP-PVD-21 HMS originally used on Su-27.\n**[[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] and airborne radar are also controlled by SUV-VEP system.\n*SUV-P: this air-to-ground subsystem utilizes identical hardware of SUV-VEP air-to-air subsystem, but with a different processing requirement. This subsystem is mainly used for [[air-to-surface missile]]s such as [[Kh-59]], and acts as an interface between the system on board the aircraft and the designated targeting pods of the [[air-to-surface missile]]s that can not be controlled directly by the onboard avionics. The primary subsystem of SUV-P system is SUO-30PK subsystem and A-737 satellite navigational subsystem.\n**SUO-30PK weaponry control subsystem: though [[Kh-31]] is often controlled by SUV-VEP air-to-air system, it can also be controlled via SUV-P system via SUO-30PK subsystem, which can also control L-150 ELINT system. SUO-30PK system also controls other missiles such as Kh-59, an air-to-ground missiles that is controlled via Tekon targeting system in the APK-9E pod. Other SUO-30PK subsystem is developed by Aviation Automation Design bureau at [[Kursk]], and it can be used to control unguided air-to-ground weaponry.\nBoth the SUV-VEP and SUV-P systems were adopted to upgrade the single seat Su-27SK in Chinese inventory, and a joint team of [[Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design]] (NIIP) and State Instrumentation Plant at [[Ryazan]] was named as the primary contractor. The modified SUV-VEP system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-VE, while the modified SUV-P system adopted to upgrade Chinese Su-27SK was designated as SUV-PE. The original analog dial indicator on flight dashboard of Su-27SK were replaced by two 6 in x 6 in MFI-10-6M and a MFIP-6 [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s. According to Russian claim, over 60 Chinese Su-27SK have been upgraded by the end of 2006.\n\n===Su-30MK2===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nWith its improved avionics, the MK2 was designed for more dedicated use as a maritime strike aircraft, thus these aircraft ordered by China are currently being operated by the Naval Air Force. The MK2 also features a better [[C4ISTAR]] (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance) abilities than the MKKs.\n\n====Mission computer====\nThe original MVK mission computer is replaced by its successor MVK-RL, with greater capability.\n\n====Communications====\nThe TKS-2 C3 system is replaced by the follow-on TSIMSS-1 digital system.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=992&zoneid=7 |title=China Debuts Aegis Destroyers |date=27 June 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220223018/http://www.afcea.org/signal/articles/templates/SIGNAL_Article_Template.asp?articleid=992&zoneid=7 |archive-date=20 February 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n====Flight instruments====\nThe two {{convert|178|x|127|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-9 colour [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s in the front cockpit and the MFI-9 and the {{convert|204|x|152|mm|in|abbr=on}} MFI-10 color [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s in the rear cockpit are replaced with four 158&nbsp;mm x 211&nbsp;mm MFI-10-5 [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] [[Multi-function display|MFD]]s. The configuration of the new displays remains the same as that of Su-30MKK.\n\n====Optronics====\nOne of the important avionic upgrades of Su-30MK2 is the incorporation of several electro-optical ([[optronic]]s) pods, a capability that is added to earlier Su-30MKK during upgrades. Two types of Russian optronic pods are sold to China for Su-30MK2, but the open architecture and other advanced designs enabled the aircraft to carry domestic optronic pods as well. This capability of Su-30MK2 has been added to the original Su-30MKKs during the incremental upgrades. The Russian optronic pods included:\n*Optronic pod \"Sapsan-E\": Sapsan ([[peregrine falcon]])-E targeting pod developed by the Ural Optical Machinery Plant weighs 250&nbsp;kg, with length of 3 m and diameter of 0.39 m. Field of view is from +10 degrees to \u221215 degrees, and the system includes TV camera and laser designators. This system is designed to supplement the OEPS-30MK-E optronic system mounted in the nose of the aircraft.\n*M400 reconnaissance pod: M400 reconnaissance pod developed by the Canopy Design Bureau is a large pod mounted between two engines. In comparison to Sapsan-E targeting pod, there is different equipment in the M400 reconnaissance pod: TV/[[Thermographic camera]]s, optical camera and [[Side looking airborne radar]]. The side-looking radar has a maximum range in excess of 100&nbsp;km with resolution of 2 metres, while the maximum range for both IR and TV cameras are in excess of 70&nbsp;km. The resolution of the TV/IR camera is 0.3-metre and 0.4-metre for the optical camera. The system can also be used to detect the blind spot behind the aircraft to provide targeting information for rearward-firing [[air-to-air missile]]s{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}, but this capability has not been utilized by the Chinese yet. The system is also capable of locking on sea targets.\n*Domestic Chinese optronics including [[FILAT]] and [[Blue Sky (navigation pod)]] can also be carried after modification of onboard system. Just like the incorporation of domestic Chinese electronic warfare pods such as BM/KG300G and [[KZ900]] to Su-30MKK, such modification was neither part of the original deal nor the upgrade deal with Russians, instead, this was implemented indigenously by the Chinese themselves during the incremental upgrades. According to Chinese claims, the domestic upgrade of Su-30MKK/MK2 were much smoother and easier than that of earlier [[Sukhoi Su-27|Su-27SK]], thanks to the western [[MIL-STD-1553]] standard Russian adopted for Su-30MKK series.\n\n====Airborne radar====\nIn 2000, China placed an order of [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar named Sokol (Falcon), designed by [[Phazotron]], while the radar was still under development, it is reported that China had either partially funded or joined the development, but this can not be confirmed. All twenty units were delivered in 2004 after the development completed at the end of 2003, and the radars are installed on the Su-30MK2. The maximum range, average and peak power of Sokol radar remain the same as that of Zhuk-MSE radar on Su-30MKK, but the maximum number of targets it can simultaneously track actually decreased by 40%, from the original 20 to 12. However, the number of targets it can simultaneously engage is increased to six from the original four, thus fully utilizing the capability of the SUV-VEP subsystem of the onboard fire control system. The diameter of the antenna array is increased to 980&nbsp;mm from the 960&nbsp;mm of Zhuk-MS/MSE. The scan sector of the radar is 170 degrees and the elevation of the scan is from \u221240 degrees to +56 degrees. The radar has three receivers and a gain of 37&nbsp;dB. When used against surface targets like a destroyer, the maximum range is doubled to 300&nbsp;km, same as that of American [[AN/APG-68]]. There is not any confirmation for any follow-on orders of Sokol radar and unlike the capability optronic pod, this radar capability is not known to be added to the earlier Su-30MKKs during the incremental upgrades.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Russia had authorized the export of Pero [[passive electronically scanned array]] [[radar]] designed by Tikhomirov, to China. The Pero antenna can be easily integrated into the existing N001VEP radar system with no significant modification by simply replacing the original slotted planar array, and thus results in increased performance. The Pero upgrade, lets the radar simultaneously engage 6 aerial targets, or 4 ground targets. The radar with Pero antenna is named as Panda radar. China, however, did not accept the offer when Russia offered the Pero upgrade package because Tikhomirov's competitor [[Phazotron]] offered China a brand new phased array radar that supposedly performed better, rumored to be Zhuk-MSF. In addition to the easy of integration, the advantage of Pero [[passive electronically scanned array]] equipped Panda radar was its weight. All other radars offered for Su-30MK2 upgrade increase weight significantly that the center of the gravity of the aircraft is altered, resulting in the need to modify the airframe and redesign the flight control system. Such problems does not exist if Panda radar is adopted because it only increases the weight by a mere 20&nbsp;kg, which will be compensated by the redesign of SILS-30 HUD to reduce its weight by 20&nbsp;kg, thus balancing out the weight increase of the radar. This claim of Timkhomirov design bureau is confirmed by both the Sukhoi design bureau and Russkaya Avionika bureau, which claimed to media reporters at 2006 Zhuhai Airshow in China that such modification had already been successfully completed. China, however, had not made a final decision by the end of 2007, and many Russian and Chinese sources have claimed that domestic Chinese HUDs of Western origin perform better and weigh much less, and China thus planned to adopt their own avionics in the next incremental upgrade, but such claims have yet to be confirmed by western sources and official sources of Chinese and Russian governments.\n\nIn response, Tikhomirov subsequently offered China its N-011M Bars [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar, the most powerful Russian airborne radar on any of its exported aircraft, but China once again rejected the offer. Many claimed that the reason for the rejection was that Chinese discovered the same problem India had during the evaluation of the radar: although the N-011M Bars [[passive electronically scanned array]] radar offered longer range and better resistance to jamming, it had the problem of accurately and correct identifying targets at long range, while others claims China simply did not want the same system used by India. However, both claims contradict with the official explanation of the Chinese government: the new radar weighs more than 650&nbsp;kg and caused the center of gravity of the aircraft to alter significantly, thus greatly degraded the aerodynamic performance and weapon payload arrangement of the Su-30MKK, which is far less adaptable to the new heavy radar than [[Su-30MKI]], because the two were based on two totally different airframes, a fact that is confirmed by ''Jane's all the World's Aircraft''. If the new radar was to be adopted, canards must be added and flight control software must be also modified for Su-30MKK just to remain the same level of performance as before, and thus, in addition to paying for the more expensive new radars, a huge amount of money must be spent in upgrading the aircraft as well.\n\n===Su-30MK3===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe MK3 was to possibly feature either the Phazotron Zhuk-MSF phased array radar, or a new \"Panda\" radar developed by Tikhomirov, which is based on Pero passive phased array radar, both were rumored to be under Chinese evaluation. Either radar would significantly improve the Su-30s air target detection range to 190&nbsp;km and surface detection range at 300&nbsp;km. It is uncertain whether the PLAN or PLAAF would order any of these aircraft, despite their significant advantages with their advanced radars. Therefore, if these radars passed Chinese tests, they will likely to be retrofitted to earlier MKK and MK2 and even possibly [[Shenyang J-11]] due to uncertain status of MK3 project.\n\nIn January 2007, Russia confirmed that the newest Irbis-E (Snow leopard-E) phased array radar in Russia's inventory, developed by Tikhomirov, was offered to China. However, it is highly unlikely that China will adopt this newest Russian airborne radar because all models of the Su-30 series can only provide half of the power required for the 5&nbsp;kW rated radar, and currently, only [[Sukhoi Su-35]] and [[Sukhoi Su-37]] have enough power to support this newest Russian airborne radar. Purchasing Irbis-E phased array radar would lock China into yet another deal with Russia to upgrade its Su-30MKK fleet that would greatly increase the cost, because China currently lacks the ability to do so by itself, or is forced to pay even higher prices to buy the Su-35 or Su-37.\n\n==Operators==\n[[File:Su-30MKK operators.png|thumb|400px|Map with Sukhoi Su-30MKK operators in blue]]\n\n===Current operators===\n;{{Flagu|People's Republic of China}}\n* [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] had 73 Su-30MKK fighters in service in 2010.<ref name=\"iiss_militarybalance2010\">{{cite book |editor-last=Hacket |editor-first=James |title=The Military Balance 2010 |publisher=[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] |year=2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |editor-last=Hacket |editor-first=James |title=The Military Balance 2010 |publisher=[[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] |year=2010}}</ref> 76 were delivered in 2000\u20132003.
