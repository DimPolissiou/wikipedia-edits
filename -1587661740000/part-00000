The hymnal editors curate the texts and the tunes, they may take a well-known tune and associate it with new poetry, or edit the previous text; hymnal committees are typically staffed by both poets and musicians. Some hymnals are produced by church bodies and others by commercial publishers. \n\nIn large denominations, the hymnal may be part of a coordinated publication project that involves several books: the pew hymnal proper, an accompaniment version (e.g. using a ring binder so that individual hymns can be removed and sit nicely on a music stand), a leader's guide (e.g. matching hymns to [[lectionary]] readings), and a hymnal companion, providing descriptions about the context, origin and character of each hymn, with a focus on the poets and composers.\n\n===Service music===\nIn some hymnals, the front section is occupied by service music, such as doxologies, three-fold and seven-fold amens, or entire orders of worship ([[Gradual]], [[Alleluia]], etc.). A section of [[Responsorial psalmody|resonsorial psalms]] may also be included.\n\n===Indexes===\nHymnals usually contain one or more indexes; some of the specialized indexes may be printed in the companion volumes rather than the hymnal itself. A first line index is almost universal. There may also be indexes for the first line of every stanza, the first lines of choruses, tune names, and a metrical index (tunes by common meter, short meter, etc.). Indexes for composers, poets, arrangers, translators, and song sources may be separate or combined. Lists of copyright acknowledgements are essential. Few other books are so well indexed; at the same time, few other books are so well memorized. Singers often have the song number of their favorite hymns memorized, as well as the words of other hymns. In this sense, a hymnal is the intersection of advanced literate culture with the persistent survival or oral traditions into the present day.\n\n==History==\n===Origins in Europe===\nThe earliest hand-written hymnals are from the [[Middle Ages]] in the context of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christianity]], although individual hymns such as the ''[[Te Deum]]'' go back much further. The [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, together with the growing popularity of [[moveable type]], quickly made hymnals a standard feature of Christian worship in all major denominations of Western and Central Europe. The first known printed hymnal was issued in 1501 in [[Prague]] by [[Unity of the Brethren|Czech Brethren]] (a small radical religious group of the [[Bohemian Reformation]]) but it contains only texts of sacred songs.<ref name=\"settari\">{{cite journal |last1=Settari |first1=Olga |title=The Czech sacred song from the period of the Reformation |journal=Sborn\u00edk prac\u00ed filozofick\u00e9 fakulty brn\u011bnsk\u00e9 univerzity.

The first hymnal of the Lutheran Reformation was ''[[Achtliederbuch]]'', followed by the ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion]]''. An important hymnal of the 17th century was ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.\n\n===Hymnals in Early America===\n\nMarket forces rather than denominational control have characterized the history of hymnals in the thirteen colonies and the antebellum United States; even today, denominations must yield to popular tastes and include \"beloved hymns\" such as [[Amazing Grace]]<ref>For example, strictly speaking, Lutherans should not sing \"grace... taught my heart to fear,\" because they believe that it is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]], ministered through divine grace, that teaches the heart and mind. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] resisted until the 2005 publication of ''Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal''. Almost all hymnal committees choose to omit the final, apocalyptic verse (\"The earth will soon dissolve like snow\"). </ref> and [[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]],<ref>Every hymnal committee edits this a different way.</ref> in their hymnals, regardless of whether the song texts conform to sectarian teaching.\n\nThe first hymnal, and also the first book, printed in [[British America|British North America]], is the [[Bay Psalm Book]], printed in 1640 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stuart A. P. |year=2009 |title=The Library An Illustrated History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCP9kHegLOcC |location=New York |publisher=[[Skyhorse Publishing]] |page=140 |isbn=9781602397064}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3600/ |title=The Bay Psalm Book |work=[[World Digital Library]] |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref>  a [[metrical Psalter]] that attempted to translate the  [[psalms]] into English so close to the [[Biblical Hebrew|original Hebrew]] that it was unsingable. The market demand created by this failure, and the dismal nature of Calvinist \"lining out the psalms\" in general, was served by hymnals for [[West gallery music|West gallery singing]] imported from England.\n\n[[William Billings]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] took the first step beyond West Gallery music in publishing ''The New-England Psalm-Singer'' (1770), the first book in which tunes were entirely composed by an American.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKay |first1=David P. |last2=Crawford |first2=Richard  |date=1975 |title=William Billings of Boston |trans-title= |url= |url-status= |format= |language= |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-09118-8 }}</ref> The tune-books of Billings and other [[Yankee tunesmiths]] were widely sold by itinerant singing-school teachers. The song texts were predominantly drawn from English [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalms]], particularly those of [[Isaac Watts]]. All of the publications of these tunesmiths (also called \"First New England School\") were essentially hymnals.\n\nIn 1801 the tunebook market was greatly expanded by the invention of [[Shape note#Origin and early history|shape notes]], which made it easier to learn how to read music. [[John Wyeth]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] printer in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], who had apprenticed in Boston during the emergence of the First New England School, began to publish tunebooks in 1810 in German and English for various sectarian groups (but not Unitarians). He saw a virgin market in the Methodist and Baptist [[Second Great Awakening|revival movement]]. Singing in these [[camp meetings]] was chaotic because multiple tunes were sung simultaneously for any given hymn text. Since he [[John Wyeth#Lack of musical training|lacked musical training]], Wyeth employed [[Elkanah Kelsey Dare]] to collect tunes and edit them. [[John Wyeth#Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second|Wyeth's Repository of Music, Part Second]] (1813) included 41 folk tunes, the first printed in America. This was also the birth of the \"folk hymn\": the use of a folk tune, collected and harmonized by a trained musician, printed with a hymn text.<ref>The hymn text was usually literary: Watts, [[Charles Wesley|Wesley]], and [[John Newton|Newton]] being the most popular.</ref> \"Nettleton,\" the tune used in North America to sing \"Come Thou Font\" (words written in 1758), first appeared here.\n\n===Southern Shape Note Hymnals (Tunebooks)===\n\nSoutherners identified with folk hymns of Wyeth's 1813 ''Part Second'' and collected more: the titles of [[Kentucky Harmony]] (1816) of [[Ananias Davisson]], the ''Tennessee Harmony'' (1818) of Alexander Johnson, the [[Missouri Harmony]] (1820) of Allen D. Carden. and the  [[Southern Harmony]] (1835) of [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]] drew attention to the fact that they contained regional folk songs for singing in two, three, or four parts. A new direction was taken by [[Benjamin Franklin White|B. F. White]] with the publication of the [[Sacred Harp]] (1844): whereas others had gone on to produce a series of tunebooks, White stopped at one, then spent the rest of his life building an organization, modeled on church conventions, to organize singing events, with the result that the ''Sacred Harp'' continues as a living tradition to the present. The other tunebooks eventually yielded to denominational hymnals that became pervasive with the development of railroad networks, with the exception of the ''Southern Harmony,'' for which there is an annual singing in [[Benton, Kentucky]] to the present day, and Walker's [[Christian Harmony]], published in 1866, with the first convention organized in 1875 (43 all-day singings in 2010); the ''Kentucky Harmony'' was republished in altered form as the [[Shenandoah Harmony]] in 2010, reviving the world of predominantly minor key melodies and unusual tonalities of Davisson's work.\n\n===The Better Music Movement in the Industrialized North===\n\nIn the North, the \"[[Lowell Mason#Assessment|Better Music Boys]],\" cultivated musicians such as [[Lowell Mason]] and [[Thomas Hastings (composer)|Thomas Hastings]] who turned to Europe for musical inspiration, introduced musical education into the school system, and emphasized the use of organs, choirs, and \"special music.\" In the long term this resulted in a decline of congregational singing. On the other hand, they also composed hymns that could be sung by everybody. Mason's ''The Handel and Haydn Society Collection of Church Music'' (1822) was published by the [[Handel and Haydn Society of Boston]] while Mason was still living in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]; nobody else would publish it. This never became a denominational hymnal but was well-received by choirs. Mason's famous hymns, which were also included in Southern tunebooks, appeared later editions or publications: Laban (\"My soul, be on thy guard;\" 1830), Hebron (\"Thus far the Lord hath led me on,\" 1830), Boylston (\"My God, my life, my love,\" 1832), Shawmut (\"Oh that I could repent! 1835\") Bethany (\"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\", as sung in the United States) (1856).\n\n===''Hymns Ancient and Modern'' appears in England===\n{{Main|Hymns Ancient and Modern}}\nIn England, the growing popularity of hymns inspired the publication of more than 100 hymnals during the period 1810\u20131850.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Julian |title=Dictionary of Hymnology |publisher=John Murray |location= |date=1892}}</ref> The sheer number of these collections prevented any one of them from being successful.<ref name=\"sing\">{{cite book |last1=Eskew |first1=Harry |last2=McElrath |first2=Hugh T. |title=Sing with Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Hymnology |date=1995 |publisher=Church Street Press |location=Nashville |isbn=9780805498257 |pages=135\u2013139}}</ref> In 1861, members of the [[Oxford Movement]] published [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]] under the musical supervision of [[William Henry Monk]],<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hymnsam.co.uk/about-us/the-history-and-traditions.aspx |title=The History and Traditions |website=Hymns Ancient & Modern |accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref>, with 273 hymns.  For the first time, translations from languages other than Hebrew appeared, the \"Ancient\" in the title referring to the appearance of [[Phos Hilaron]], translated from Greek by [[John Keble]], and many hymns translated from Latin.

In this sense, a hymnal is the intersection of advanced literate culture with the persistent survival or oral traditions into the present day.\n\n==History==\n===Origins in Europe===\nThe earliest hand-written hymnals are from the [[Middle Ages]] in the context of [[Christianity in Europe|European Christianity]], although individual hymns such as the ''[[Te Deum]]'' go back much further. The [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, together with the growing popularity of [[moveable type]], quickly made hymnals a standard feature of Christian worship in all major denominations of Western and Central Europe. The first known printed hymnal was issued in 1501 in [[Prague]] by [[Unity of the Brethren|Czech Brethren]] (a small radical religious group of the [[Bohemian Reformation]]) but it contains only texts of sacred songs.<ref name=\"settari\">{{cite journal |last1=Settari |first1=Olga |title=The Czech sacred song from the period of the Reformation |journal=Sborn\u00edk prac\u00ed filozofick\u00e9 fakulty brn\u011bnsk\u00e9 univerzity.

The first hymnal of the Lutheran Reformation was ''[[Achtliederbuch]]'', followed by the ''[[Erfurt Enchiridion]]''. An important hymnal of the 17th century was ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]''.\n\n===Hymnals in Early America===\n\nMarket forces rather than denominational control have characterized the history of hymnals in the thirteen colonies and the antebellum United States; even today, denominations must yield to popular tastes and include \"beloved hymns\" such as [[Amazing Grace]]<ref>For example, strictly speaking, Lutherans should not sing \"grace... taught my heart to fear,\" because they believe that it is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Word of God]], ministered through divine grace, that teaches the heart and mind. The [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] resisted until the 2005 publication of ''Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal''. Almost all hymnal committees choose to omit the final, apocalyptic verse (\"The earth will soon dissolve like snow\"). </ref> and [[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]],<ref>Every hymnal committee edits this a different way.</ref> in their hymnals, regardless of whether the song texts conform to sectarian teaching.\n\nThe first hymnal, and also the first book, printed in [[British America|British North America]], is the [[Bay Psalm Book]], printed in 1640 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Murray |first=Stuart A.

The market demand created by this failure, and the dismal nature of Calvinist \"lining out the psalms\" in general, was served by hymnals for [[West gallery music|West gallery singing]] imported from England.\n\n[[William Billings]] of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] took the first step beyond West Gallery music in publishing ''The New-England Psalm-Singer'' (1770), the first book in which tunes were entirely composed by an American.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKay |first1=David P. |last2=Crawford |first2=Richard  |date=1975 |title=William Billings of Boston |trans-title= |url= |url-status= |format= |language= |location=Princeton, NJ |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-09118-8 }}</ref> The tune-books of Billings and other [[Yankee tunesmiths]] were widely sold by itinerant singing-school teachers. The song texts were predominantly drawn from English [[Metrical psalter|metrical psalms]], particularly those of [[Isaac Watts]]. All of the publications of these tunesmiths (also called \"First New England School\") were essentially hymnals.\n\nIn 1801 the tunebook market was greatly expanded by the invention of [[Shape note#Origin and early history|shape notes]], which made it easier to learn how to read music. [[John Wyeth]], a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] printer in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]], who had apprenticed in Boston during the emergence of the First New England School, began to publish tunebooks in 1810 in German and English for various sectarian groups (but not Unitarians). He saw a virgin market in the Methodist and Baptist [[Second Great Awakening|revival movement]]. Singing in these [[camp meetings]] was chaotic because multiple tunes were sung simultaneously for any given hymn text. Since he [[John Wyeth#Lack of musical training|lacked musical training]], Wyeth employed [[Elkanah Kelsey Dare]] to collect tunes and edit them. [[John Wyeth#Wyeth's Repository of Sacred Music, Part Second|Wyeth's Repository of Music, Part Second]] (1813) included 41 folk tunes, the first printed in America. This was also the birth of the \"folk hymn\": the use of a folk tune, collected and harmonized by a trained musician, printed with a hymn text.<ref>The hymn text was usually literary: Watts, [[Charles Wesley|Wesley]], and [[John Newton|Newton]] being the most popular.</ref> \"Nettleton,\" the tune used in North America to sing \"Come Thou Font\" (words written in 1758), first appeared here.\n\n===Southern Shape Note Hymnals (Tunebooks)===\n\nSoutherners identified with folk hymns of Wyeth's 1813 ''Part Second'' and collected more: the titles of [[Kentucky Harmony]] (1816) of [[Ananias Davisson]], the ''Tennessee Harmony'' (1818) of Alexander Johnson, the [[Missouri Harmony]] (1820) of Allen D. Carden. and the  [[Southern Harmony]] (1835) of [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]] drew attention to the fact that they contained regional folk songs for singing in two, three, or four parts. A new direction was taken by [[Benjamin Franklin White|B. F. White]] with the publication of the [[Sacred Harp]] (1844): whereas others had gone on to produce a series of tunebooks, White stopped at one, then spent the rest of his life building an organization, modeled on church conventions, to organize singing events, with the result that the ''Sacred Harp'' continues as a living tradition to the present. The other tunebooks eventually yielded to denominational hymnals that became pervasive with the development of railroad networks, with the exception of the ''Southern Harmony,'' for which there is an annual singing in [[Benton, Kentucky]] to the present day, and Walker's [[Christian Harmony]], published in 1866, with the first convention organized in 1875 (43 all-day singings in 2010); the ''Kentucky Harmony'' was republished in altered form as the [[Shenandoah Harmony]] in 2010, reviving the world of predominantly minor key melodies and unusual tonalities of Davisson's work.\n\n===The Better Music Movement in the Industrialized North===\n\nIn the North, the \"[[Lowell Mason#Assessment|Better Music Boys]],\" cultivated musicians such as [[Lowell Mason]] and [[Thomas Hastings]] who turned to Europe for musical inspiration, introduced musical education into the school system, and emphasized the use of organs, choirs, and \"special music.\" In the long term this resulted in a decline of congregational singing. On the other hand, they also composed hymns that could be sung by everybody. Mason's ''The Handel and Haydn Society Collection of Church Music'' (1822) was published by the [[Handel and Haydn Society of Boston]] while Mason was still living in [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]; nobody else would publish it. This never became a denominational hymnal but was well-received by choirs. Mason's famous hymns, which were also included in Southern tunebooks, appeared later editions or publications: Laban (\"My soul, be on thy guard;\" 1830), Hebron (\"Thus far the Lord hath led me on,\" 1830), Boylston (\"My God, my life, my love,\" 1832), Shawmut (\"Oh that I could repent! 1835\") Bethany (\"[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]\", as sung in the United States) (1856).\n\n===''Hymns Ancient and Modern'' appears in England===\n{{Main|Hymns Ancient and Modern}}\nIn England, the growing popularity of hymns inspired the publication of more than 100 hymnals during the period 1810\u20131850.<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Julian |title=Dictionary of Hymnology |publisher=John Murray |location= |date=1892}}</ref> The sheer number of these collections prevented any one of them from being successful.<ref name=\"sing\">{{cite book |last1=Eskew |first1=Harry |last2=McElrath |first2=Hugh T. |title=Sing with Understanding: An Introduction to Christian Hymnology |date=1995 |publisher=Church Street Press |location=Nashville |isbn=9780805498257 |pages=135\u2013139}}</ref> In 1861, members of the [[Oxford Movement]] published [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]] under the musical supervision of [[William Henry Monk]],<ref name=\"hist\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hymnsam.co.uk/about-us/the-history-and-traditions.aspx |title=The History and Traditions |website=Hymns Ancient & Modern |accessdate=26 December 2014}}</ref>, with 273 hymns.  For the first time, translations from languages other than Hebrew appeared, the \"Ancient\" in the title referring to the appearance of [[Phos Hilaron]], translated from Greek by [[John Keble]], and many hymns translated from Latin.

{"title_page": "Culinary linguistics", "text_new": "Culinary linguistics,  a sub-branch of [[applied linguistics]], is the study of food and language across various interdisciplinary fields such as [[linguistic]], [[anthropology]], [[sociolinguistics]], and consumption politics and globalisation.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\">{{cite journal|last1= Cavanaugh|first1= Jillian R.|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C.|last3= Jaffe|first3= Alexandra|last4= Jourdan|first4= Christine|last5= Karreb\u00e6k|first5= Martha|last6= Paugh|first6= Amy|year= 2014|title= What Words Bring to the Table: The Linguistic Anthropological Toolkit as Applied to the Study of Food |journal= Journal of Linguistic Anthropology |volume= 24|pages= 84-97|doi= 10.1111/jola.12038}}</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\n\n=== Written Language ===\nScholarly inquiry that deals with written language employs [[semiotics]] and [[ethnolinguistics]] methodologies, utilizing operational frameworks such as corpus [[linguistics]], [[language ideology]], written [[discourse analysis]], [[dialectology]], and [[theoretical lexicography]]. Research typically engages with various media forms, official documents or [[white papers]], and text found in food production sites - markets, production facilities, restaurants, etc. This generally entails the empirical analysis of words and [[phrases]] (eg. [[idioms]] or [[metaphors]]) to investigate intertextual relations between writer/producer, audience, and sociocultural/political realities.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\"></ref>\n\n=== Spoken Language ===\nAnother significant fraction of culinary linguistics deals with spoken language in which methodologies such as food-oriented interviews, collaborative translation, participant [[observation]], and [[focus group]] dialogues are used and are more prominent. This usually invokes similar concepts like [[language socialization]], spoken discourse analysis, and [[paralinguistics]].\n\n=== Visual Language ===\nApart from written and spoken means of communicating about foods, one also uses [[body language]] to portray their attitudes towards food. For example, simply from reading one's expressions, the audience can tell whether the food is \"nice\", \"disgusting\" or \"mmm\" to the taster. Besides expressions, actions such as emptying a glass can inform interlocutors that it is the drinker's final sip, as well as indicating the end of the talk <ref name=\"Food and Language\">{{cite journal|last1= Karrebaek|first1= Martha Sif|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C|last3= Cavanaugh|first3= Jilian R|year= 2018|title= Food and Language: Production, Consumption, and Circulation of Meaning and Value|journal= Annual Reviews of Anthropology|pages= 17-26|publisher= Annual Reviews|doi= 10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050109)}}</ref>. \n\n== Food Politics ==\nCulinary linguistics mainly addresses [[persuasive writing]] in [[food politics]], occurred in the processes of production, distribution, labelling, agency, responsibility, and consumption. For example, an excerpt from Guy Cook\u2019s article \u201cSweet talking: food, language, and democracy\u201d <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\">{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Guy|year= 2010|title= Sweet Talking: Food, Language, and Democracy|journal= Language Teaching |volume= 43|issue= 2|pages= 168-181|doi= 10.1017/S0261444809990140}}</ref> reads:\n\n{{quote|\u201cYou can buy the same product at a low price in one aisle, or at a high price in another aisle. The difference is in the description. A loaf of white bread without words, for example, costs \u00a30.75p for 400g, but white breadcrumbs catchily labelled as \u2018a handful of breadcrumbs\u2019 cost \u00a31.19 for 100g. People are sweet-talked into buying such things.\u201d (Cook 2010)}}\n\nProminent topics across food language and politics include product labelling, debates over [[genetically modified food]] (GM foods), and [[organic food]]marketing (see [[food marketing]]).<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== Product Labelling ===\nApplying culinary linguistics to product labelling, research <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> broaches the themes of linguistic ambiguity; [[rhetorical device|rhetorical figures]] - alliteration, metaphor, hyperbole and superlatives, rhythm and \u2018poetic\u2019 phrasing; [[narrative techniques]]; and sociolinguistics that pertains to sensory/sensual connotations associated with food description (see also [[food and sexuality]]).\n\nFor example, the themes of ambiguity and sensual language can be extrapolated via syntactic analysis (eg. noun-modifiers) of labels like:\n\n{{quote|\"masterfully prepared sweetened real fruit juice pieces, made from a blend of pomegranate and other select concentrated fruit juices\", are dipped in \"our extra creamy pure dark chocolate\" to create this \"decadent taste sensation\"\n(Cook 2010)<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>}}\n\n{{quote|Potato chips - \u201cveggie chips\u201d; milk shakes - \u201csmoothies\u201d; sugary drinks - \u201cflavored water\u201d; etc.\n(Irmak et al. 2011)<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\">{{cite journal|last1= Irmak|first1= Caglar|last2= Vallen|first2= Beth|last3= Robinson|first3= Stefanie R.|year= 2011|title= The Impact of Product Name on Dieters\u2019 and Nondieters\u2019 Food Evaluations and Consumption|journal= Journal of Consumer Research |volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 390-405|doi= 10.1086/660044}}</ref>}}\n\n====Product labelling and Health====\nArguments around vague language in food labelling are also tied to issues of health (see [[nutrition facts label]]). For example, research on [[infant formula]] addresses [[fine print]] as a critical realization of [[multimodality]] and its effects on communication, particularly in conveying the saliency of health information. Research have additionally expounded on the links between \u201cthe ambiguity inherent in the naming of some products\u201d<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref> and the differences in perceptions of healthfulness and taste by dieters and non-dieters. Furthermore, such research broaches [[psycholinguistics]] by noting that these different groups demonstrate differing capacities to subconsciously alter their taste perceptions based on languages in food labels. Existing linguistic research on food labelling and health also addresses objective meal sizes, nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat\u201d), health benefit claims (e.g., \u201cmay increase bone density\u201d; and brand names. <ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref>\n\n==== Product labelling and Environmentalism ====\nCulinary linguistics further delineates ties with the social and environmental facets of food politics. For example, conventional [[marketing strategies]], that appeal to emotion and self interest, have supplanted rhetorics around [[environmentalism]]\n\n\u201cIn its list of \u2018Ten Reasons to Buy Organic\u2019, The Soil Association (the main UK organic campaign group and certification body) at one time moved its alliterative slogan \u2018Top for Taste\u2019 to first position and demoted \u2018Good for Wildlife\u2019 from number one to number ten\u201d.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== GM and anti-GM debates ===\nMore closely aligned with political discourse analysis, culinary linguistics has also been applied to debates about GM food products, paying particular attention to [[lexical items]] and connotations. Language associated with emotion and hysteria is often employed in pro-GM arguments through referencing anti-GM rhetoric, a linguistic technique that derides their opposition\u2019s persuasions as [[fearmongering]] rather than objectively substantial.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> Furthermore, military metaphors (see [[war as metaphor]]) were noted to be commonplace in these arguments, foregrounding the perception of threat. <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n== Language and Food Service ==\n=== Menus ===\nDan Jurafsky (PhD; Linguistics and Computer Science; [[Stanford University]]) observed the utility of culinary linguistics in his research that analysed thousands of [[menu]]s in the [[United States]], asserting that prices could be accurately predicted simply from looking at the language used to describe dishes in these menus.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/82f41202-27f3-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0 |title= The secret language of food |author= Jurafsky, Dan |date= August 22, 2014|publisher= Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe more expensive the restaurant, the fancier the words. Difficult foreign words (\u201ctonnarelli\u201d, \u201cchoclo\u201d, \u201cbastilla\u201d, \u201cpersillade\u201d, \u201coyako\u201d) are an implicit signal of the high-educational status of the menu writer and, by extension, the customer \u2026 expensive menus were shorter and more implicit. By contrast, the wordy menus of middle-priced restaurants were stuffed with adjectives (\u201cfresh\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cmild\u201d, \u201ccrisp\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201cgolden brown\u201d), while positive but vague words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201csavoury\u201d were used by the cheapest restaurants; high-status restaurants want their customers to presuppose that food will be fresh, crisp and delicious. The surfeit of adjectives on middle-priced menus is thus a kind of overcompensation, a sign of status anxiety, and only the cheapest restaurants, in which the tastiness of the food might be in question, must overly protest the toothsomeness of their treats.\u201d\n\n=== Food Reviews ===\nFood reviews (see [[food critic]]) are written to provide feedback about [[foodservice]] in [[restaurants]]. For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref> By allowing continuous revisions and comments to be added, food blogs reflect the relations of food with its readers across varied cultural backgrounds <ref name=\"Food and Language\"></ref>. \n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories. Diemer and Frobenius distinguish the vocabulary on food blogs into seven categories: 1) food jargon such as recipe or food 2)  ingredients, food and recipe types, such as salt or cream 3) non-English terms like vollkorn and gelato 4) kitchen tools, for example bowl and pan 5) preparation methods, such as heat and bake 6)amounts and measures, like cup or minutes 7) blog-specific terminology such as comments or post. <ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\"></ref>\n\n==== Culinary verb use ====\nThe most common non-auxiliary verbs (see [[auxiliary verb]]) are action verbs that describe activities in the lexical field of [[cooking]], like make, add, cook, serve, take, chop, bake or fry. In addition, there are activities related to food procurement, such as buy or pick, and consumption, such as eat.\n\n=== Recipes ===\n\n[[Recipes]] may come in written or spoken form. Written recipes are considered procedural discourse, which is agency neutral and time neutral.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wharton|first1 = Tim|year= 2012|title=Recipes: Beyond the Words|journal=Gastronomica:The Journal for Food Studies ,Vol.10No.4|pages=67-73|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|doi= 10.1525/gfc.2010.10.4.67)}}</ref> \u201cThis agency/ time neutrality is reflected in the use of the imperative form\u201d, which has no overt subject and no grammatical tense in English.

It involves the performance of food preparation in front of a live or television audience by a host, typically, a [[celebrity chef]].\n\n==== Instructions ====\nAn essential part of cooking shows is the delivery of instructions during food preparation. Such instructions are usually influenced by the linguistic styles of different celebrity chef personalities. For example, British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] is known for employing slang in his performance of culinary speech. He often substitutes the traditional terms like \u201cto add\u201d with a slang verb, \u201cto chuck\u201d (meaning \u2018to throw\u2019).\n\n==== Expressing Emotions ====\nThe medium of television allows for emotions in culinary discourse to be conveyed through visual and aural signifiers.\n\n===== Visual language =====\nThe use of facial expressions and [[body language]] are visual ways in which emotions arising from food preparation and consumption are communicated to the audience.\n\u201c In humans, the characteristic facial expressions that coincide with the experience of disgust and distaste include behaviors such as gaping and nose wrinkling, are usually elicited by nausea or revulsion. These negative expressions are typically evoked by unpalatable tastes, such as bitter, both in children and in adults.

Research typically engages with various media forms, official documents or [[white papers]], and text found in food production sites - markets, production facilities, restaurants, etc. This generally entails the empirical analysis of words and [[phrases]] (eg. [[idioms]] or [[metaphors]]) to investigate intertextual relations between writer/producer, audience, and sociocultural/political realities.<ref name=\"What words bring to the table\"></ref>\n\n=== Spoken Language ===\nAnother significant fraction of culinary linguistics deals with spoken language in which methodologies such as food-oriented interviews, collaborative translation, participant [[observation]], and [[focus group]] dialogues are used and are more prominent. This usually invokes similar concepts like [[language socialization]], spoken discourse analysis, and [[paralinguistics]].\n\n=== Visual Language ===\nApart from written and spoken means of communicating about foods, one also uses [[body language]] to portray their attitudes towards food. For example, simply from reading one's expressions, the audience can tell whether the food is is \"nice\", \"disgusting\" or \"mmm\" to the taster. Besides expressions, actions such as emptying a glass can inform interlocutors that it is the drinker's final sip, as well as indicating the end of the talk <ref name=\"Food and Language\">{{cite journal|last1= Karrebaek|first1= Martha Sif|last2= Riley|first2= Kathleen C|last3= Cavanaugh|first3= Jilian R|year= 2018|title= Food and Language: Production, Consumption, and Circulation of Meaning and Value|journal= Annual Reviews of Anthropology|pages= 17-26|publisher= Annual Reviews|doi= 10.1146/annurev-anthro-102317-050109)}}</ref>. \n\n== Food Politics ==\nCulinary linguistics mainly addresses [[persuasive writing]] in [[food politics]], occurred in the processes of production, distribution, labelling, agency, responsibility, and consumption. For example, an excerpt from Guy Cook\u2019s article \u201cSweet talking: food, language, and democracy\u201d <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\">{{cite journal|last1= Cook|first1= Guy|year= 2010|title= Sweet Talking: Food, Language, and Democracy|journal= Language Teaching |volume= 43|issue= 2|pages= 168-181|doi= 10.1017/S0261444809990140}}</ref> reads:\n\n{{quote|\u201cYou can buy the same product at a low price in one aisle, or at a high price in another aisle. The difference is in the description. A loaf of white bread without words, for example, costs \u00a30.75p for 400g, but white breadcrumbs catchily labelled as \u2018a handful of breadcrumbs\u2019 cost \u00a31.19 for 100g. People are sweet-talked into buying such things.\u201d (Cook 2010)}}\n\nProminent topics across food language and politics include product labelling, debates over [[genetically modified food]] (GM foods), and [[organic food]]marketing (see [[food marketing]]).<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== Product Labelling ===\nApplying culinary linguistics to product labelling, research <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> broaches the themes of linguistic ambiguity; [[rhetorical device|rhetorical figures]] - alliteration, metaphor, hyperbole and superlatives, rhythm and \u2018poetic\u2019 phrasing; [[narrative techniques]]; and sociolinguistics that pertains to sensory/sensual connotations associated with food description (see also [[food and sexuality]]).\n\nFor example, the themes of ambiguity and sensual language can be extrapolated via syntactic analysis (eg. noun-modifiers) of labels like:\n\n{{quote|\"masterfully prepared sweetened real fruit juice pieces, made from a blend of pomegranate and other select concentrated fruit juices\", are dipped in \"our extra creamy pure dark chocolate\" to create this \"decadent taste sensation\"\n(Cook 2010)<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>}}\n\n{{quote|Potato chips - \u201cveggie chips\u201d; milk shakes - \u201csmoothies\u201d; sugary drinks - \u201cflavored water\u201d; etc.\n(Irmak et al. 2011)<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\">{{cite journal|last1= Irmak|first1= Caglar|last2= Vallen|first2= Beth|last3= Robinson|first3= Stefanie R.|year= 2011|title= The Impact of Product Name on Dieters\u2019 and Nondieters\u2019 Food Evaluations and Consumption|journal= Journal of Consumer Research |volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 390-405|doi= 10.1086/660044}}</ref>}}\n\n====Product labelling and Health====\nArguments around vague language in food labelling are also tied to issues of health (see [[nutrition facts label]]). For example, research on [[infant formula]] addresses [[fine print]] as a critical realization of [[multimodality]] and its effects on communication, particularly in conveying the saliency of health information. Research have additionally expounded on the links between \u201cthe ambiguity inherent in the naming of some products\u201d<ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref> and the differences in perceptions of healthfulness and taste by dieters and non-dieters. Furthermore, such research broaches [[psycholinguistics]] by noting that these different groups demonstrate differing capacities to subconsciously alter their taste perceptions based on languages in food labels. Existing linguistic research on food labelling and health also addresses objective meal sizes, nutrient content claims (e.g., \u201clow fat\u201d), health benefit claims (e.g., \u201cmay increase bone density\u201d; and brand names. <ref name=\"The Impact of Product Name\"></ref>\n\n==== Product labelling and Environmentalism ====\nCulinary linguistics further delineates ties with the social and environmental facets of food politics. For example, conventional [[marketing strategies]], that appeal to emotion and self interest, have supplanted rhetorics around [[environmentalism]]\n\n\u201cIn its list of \u2018Ten Reasons to Buy Organic\u2019, The Soil Association (the main UK organic campaign group and certification body) at one time moved its alliterative slogan \u2018Top for Taste\u2019 to first position and demoted \u2018Good for Wildlife\u2019 from number one to number ten\u201d.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n=== GM and anti-GM debates ===\nMore closely aligned with political discourse analysis, culinary linguistics has also been applied to debates about GM food products, paying particular attention to [[lexical items]] and connotations. Language associated with emotion and hysteria is often employed in pro-GM arguments through referencing anti-GM rhetoric, a linguistic technique that derides their opposition\u2019s persuasions as [[fearmongering]] rather than objectively substantial.<ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref> Furthermore, military metaphors (see [[war as metaphor]]) were noted to be commonplace in these arguments, foregrounding the perception of threat. <ref name=\"Sweet Talking\"></ref>\n\n== Language and Food Service ==\n=== Menus ===\nDan Jurafsky (PhD; Linguistics and Computer Science; [[Stanford University]]) observed the utility of culinary linguistics in his research that analysed thousands of [[menu]]s in the [[United States]], asserting that prices could be accurately predicted simply from looking at the language used to describe dishes in these menus.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.ft.com/content/82f41202-27f3-11e4-ae44-00144feabdc0 |title= The secret language of food |author= Jurafsky, Dan |date= August 22, 2014|publisher= Financial Times}}</ref>\n\n\u201cThe more expensive the restaurant, the fancier the words. Difficult foreign words (\u201ctonnarelli\u201d, \u201cchoclo\u201d, \u201cbastilla\u201d, \u201cpersillade\u201d, \u201coyako\u201d) are an implicit signal of the high-educational status of the menu writer and, by extension, the customer \u2026 expensive menus were shorter and more implicit. By contrast, the wordy menus of middle-priced restaurants were stuffed with adjectives (\u201cfresh\u201d, \u201crich\u201d, \u201cmild\u201d, \u201ccrisp\u201d, \u201ctender\u201d, \u201cgolden brown\u201d), while positive but vague words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d, \u201ctasty\u201d and \u201csavoury\u201d were used by the cheapest restaurants; high-status restaurants want their customers to presuppose that food will be fresh, crisp and delicious. The surfeit of adjectives on middle-priced menus is thus a kind of overcompensation, a sign of status anxiety, and only the cheapest restaurants, in which the tastiness of the food might be in question, must overly protest the toothsomeness of their treats.\u201d\n\n=== Food Reviews ===\nFood reviews (see [[food critic]]) are written to provide feedback about [[foodservice]] in [[restaurants]]. For \u201ceaters\u201d, reading these reviews help them to decide the places to eat. For linguists, analysing the language such as metaphors and emotions, written in the reviews, increases their understanding about human psychology.<ref name=\"The language of Food\">{{cite book|last = Jurafsky|first = Dan|title = The language of food: A linguist reads the menu|publisher = WW Norton & Company|year = 2014}}</ref>\nStudies about the use of language in food reviews revealed patterns in the word choice for good and bad reviews. Good reviews reflect positive feedback about the customers\u2019 experiences in restaurants while bad reviews show customers\u2019 dissatisfaction about their experiences when they visit the restaurants. However, a comparison of studies conducted with different populations, revealed that these patterns varied across [[cultures]].\n\nAccording to a study conducted by researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, they discovered patterns in the word choices of American food reviewers, by analysing one million online restaurant reviews on Yelp. Their findings showed that people generally use positive emotional words such as \u201cdelicious\u201d or \u201camazing\u201d in good reviews while negative emotional words such as \u201chorrible\u201d or \u201cgross\u201d were found in bad reviews. Specifically, in bad reviews, a phenomenon \u2018negative differentiation\u2019 surfaced. Compared to good reviews that contained positive vague words, in bad reviews, food reviewers describe the taste, smell and appearance with greater precision and wider range of vocabulary. They also used words related to tragedy or trauma, on top of using collective [[pronouns]] such as \u201cwe\u201d to emphasize their victimisation by the poor dining experiences.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nThe study also showed the difference in metaphors used in good reviews to describe dining experiences in expensive and cheap restaurants. Reviews containing metaphors of sex and sensual pleasure, such as \u201cseductively seared foie gras\u201d were often used to describe foods served in expensive restaurants. On the other hand, metaphors of drugs or addiction such as \u201cthe wings are addicting\u201d were used to describe the food in cheap restaurants.<ref name=\"The language of Food\"></ref>\n\nA similar study was conducted to study the food reviews in [[Turkey]]. Its findings revealed that Turkish food reviewers do not use sexual or drug metaphors in their reviews, possibly due to their culture. Generally, they used expressions related to \u201cto faint\u201d to express delight in all their reviews. Unlike Americans, Turkish food reviewers do not differentiate between the price of the restaurants. Instead, they prioritise authentic and healthy Turkish foods. Hence, reviews containing these words are deemed to be good reviews.<ref>{{cite thesis|last= Cupery|first= Maria Joy|date= 2017|title= Food and Language: Price-Based Lexical Variation in Turkish Online Restaurant Reviews|publisher= ProQuest LLC}}</ref>\n\nAnother feature in food reviews that determines the quality of food is the use of onomatopoeia. Food reviewers use onomatopoeia to express the various degrees of taste, texture and appearance of the foods to help their readers visualise the images. In a study about the usage of [[onomatopoeia]] in food reviews, researchers gathered common words that were used to describe different cuisines. For example, \u201cZuruzuru\u201d (Japanese) was used in reviews to describe noodles.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Mori|first3= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Discovering pattern of onomatopoeia used in food reviews|journal= The 6th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems, and The 13th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligence Systems|publisher= Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers |doi= 10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6505214}}</ref> Another similar study further explained that since such words resemble the sounds of eating noodles, the food reviews can be understood by foreigners as well. <ref>{{cite journal|last1= Kato|first1= Ayumi|last2= Fukazawa|first2= Yusuke|last3= Sato|first3= Tomomasa|last4= Mori|first4= Taketoshi|year= 2012|title= Extraction of Onomatopoeia Used for Foods from Food Reviews and its Application to Restaurant Search|journal= WWW 2012 Companion|pages= 719-728|publisher= International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2)|doi= 10.1145/2187980.2188192)}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistics in Food Preparation ==\n\n=== Food Blogs ===\nFood blogs (see [[food blogging]]) are part of the written and asynchronous genre of CMC [[Computer-mediated communication]] as they revolve around the preparation, consumption and evaluation of food in all varieties and contexts.\n<ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\">{{cite book|editor-last= Gerdhardt|editor-first= Cornelia|editor2-last= Frobenius|editor2-first= Maximiliane|editor3-last= Ley|editor3-first= Susanne|title= Culinary Linguistics: The chef's special|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company|date= July 4, 2013|pages= 53-82|chapter= \u201cWhen making pie, all ingredients must be chilled.Including you: Lexical, syntactic and interactive features in online discourse\u2014a synchronic study of food blogs\u201d|isbn= 978-9027202932}}</ref> By allowing continuous revisions and comments to be added, food blogs reflect the relations of food with its readers across varied cultural backgrounds <ref name=\"Food and Language\"></ref>. \n==== Special purpose discourse ====\nA prominent [[lexicon|lexical]] feature of food blogs is special purpose vocabulary, or as Crystal in [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language]<ref>{{cite book|last1= Crystal|first1 = David|title = The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language|publisher = Cambridge: CUP|year = 1996}}</ref>  terms \u201coccupational variety\u201d, indicated by \u201cthe frequent and central use of special vocabulary and jargon.\u201d The corpus of food blogs include terms from various categories. Diemer and Frobenius distinguish the vocabulary on food blogs into seven categories: 1) food jargon such as recipe or food 2)  ingredients, food and recipe types, such as salt or cream 3) non-English terms like vollkorn and gelato 4) kitchen tools, for example bowl and pan 5) preparation methods, such as heat and bake 6)amounts and measures, like cup or minutes 7) blog-specific terminology such as comments or post. <ref name=\"When making pie, all ingredients must be chilled\"></ref>\n\n==== Culinary verb use ====\nThe most common non-auxiliary verbs (see [[auxiliary verb]]) are action verbs that describe activities in the lexical field of [[cooking]], like make, add, cook, serve, take, chop, bake or fry. In addition, there are activities related to food procurement, such as buy or pick, and consumption, such as eat.\n\n=== Recipes ===\n\n[[Recipes]] may come in written or spoken form. Written recipes are considered procedural discourse, which is agency neutral and time neutral.<ref>{{cite journal|last1= Wharton|first1 = Tim|year= 2012|title=Recipes: Beyond the Words|journal=Gastronomica:The Journal for Food Studies ,Vol.10No.4|pages=67-73|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|doi= 10.1525/gfc.2010.10.4.67)}}</ref> \u201cThis agency/ time neutrality is reflected in the use of the imperative form\u201d, which has no overt subject and no grammatical tense in English. Spoken recipes can be likened to narratives and sets of instructions, as they \u201ctend to switch back and forth between the first person past tense of the former and the second person imperative of the latter <ref>{{cite journal |last= Norrick |first= Neal |date= 2011 |title= Conversational Recipe Telling |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010|journal= Journal of Pragmatics |volume=43|issue=11 |pages= 2740\u20132761  |doi= 10.1016/j.pragma.2011.04.010 |access-date= March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooking Shows ===\n\n[[Cooking show]]s or cookery programmes are forms of spoken discourse in culinary linguistics. It involves the performance of food preparation in front of a live or television audience by a host, typically, a [[celebrity chef]].\n\n==== Instructions ====\nAn essential part of cooking shows is the delivery of instructions during food preparation. Such instructions are usually influenced by the linguistic styles of different celebrity chef personalities. For example, British celebrity chef [[Jamie Oliver]] is known for employing slang in his performance of culinary speech. He often substitutes the traditional terms like \u201cto add\u201d with a slang verb, \u201cto chuck\u201d (meaning \u2018to throw\u2019).\n\n==== Expressing Emotions ====\nThe medium of television allows for emotions in culinary discourse to be conveyed through visual and aural signifiers.\n\n===== Visual language =====\nThe use of facial expressions and [[body language]] are visual ways in which emotions arising from food preparation and consumption are communicated to the audience.\n\u201c In humans, the characteristic facial expressions that coincide with the experience of disgust and distaste include behaviors such as gaping and nose wrinkling, are usually elicited by nausea or revulsion.

Mainframe computers are often used as servers.\n\n==Design==\nModern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by:\n* Redundant internal engineering resulting in high reliability and security\n* Extensive input-output (\"I/O\") facilities with the ability to offload to separate engines\n* Strict [[backward compatibility]] with older software\n* High hardware and computational utilization rates through virtualization to support massive [[throughput]].\n*[[Hot swapping|Hot-swapping of hardware]], such as processors and memory.\n\nTheir high stability and reliability enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time, with [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) measured in decades.\n\nMainframes have [[high availability]], one of the primary reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|reliability, availability and serviceability]] (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation are required to realize these features. In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] vulnerabilities database, [[US-CERT]], rates traditional mainframes such as IBM Z (previously called z Systems, System z and zSeries), Unisys Dorado and Unisys Libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for [[Windows]], [[UNIX]], and [[Linux]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Vulnerability Database|accessdate=September 20, 2011 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm}}</ref> Software upgrades usually require setting up the [[operating system]] or portions thereof, and are non-disruptive only when using [[Virtualization|virtualizing]] facilities such as IBM [[z/OS]] and [[IBM Parallel Sysplex|Parallel Sysplex]], or Unisys XPCL, which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another's application while it is being refreshed.\n\nIn the late 1950s, mainframes had only a rudimentary interactive interface (the console) and used sets of [[punched cards]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], or [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] to transfer data and programs. They operated in [[batch processing|batch]] mode to support [[back office]] functions such as payroll and customer billing, most of which were based on repeated tape-based [[Merge sort|sorting and merging]] operations followed by [[line printer|line printing]] to preprinted [[continuous stationery]]. When interactive user terminals were introduced, they were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. [[Computer reservations system|airline booking]]) rather than program development. [[IBM 2741|Typewriter]] and [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] devices were common control consoles for system operators through the early 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]/[[Display device|display]] devices.\n\nBy the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals<ref group=NB> Some had been introduced in the 1960s, but their deployment became more common in the 1970s</ref> operating as [[timesharing]] computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through keyboard/typewriter terminals and specialized text [[Computer terminal|terminal]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays with integral keyboards, or later from [[personal computer]]s equipped with [[terminal emulation]] software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This form of end-user computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with [[GUI]]s. After 2000, modern mainframes partially or entirely phased out classic \"[[Monochrome monitor|green screen]]\" and color display terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s, when [[CMOS]] mainframe designs replaced the older [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes reduced data center energy costs for power and cooling, and reduced physical space requirements compared to [[server farms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Get the facts on IBM vs the Competition- The facts about IBM System z \"mainframe\" |publisher=IBM |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/migratetoibm/getthefacts/mainframe.html#4}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Inside Z9 2094.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Inside an [[IBM System z9]] mainframe]]\n\nModern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of [[virtual machine]]s allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional [[Server (computing)|servers]]. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2551154/virtualization/emulation-or-virtualization-.html|title=Emulation or Virtualization?}}</ref>\n\nMainframes can add or [[hot swap]] system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Modern mainframes, notably the IBM [[zSeries]], [[IBM System z9|System z9]] and [[IBM System z10|System z10]] servers, offer two levels of [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]]: logical partitions ([[LPAR]]s, via the [[PR/SM]] facility) and virtual machines (via the [[z/VM]] operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center and one in their [[disaster recovery|backup data center]]\u2014fully active, partially active, or on standby\u2014in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by [[Parallel Sysplex]] and shared [[Direct access storage device|DASD]] (in IBM's case),{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.\n\nMainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late 1950s,<ref group=NB>E.g., the [[IBM 709]] had channels in 1958</ref> mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware<ref group=NB>sometimes computers, sometimes more limited</ref> (called [[System/360#Channels|''channels'']] or [[CDC 6600#Peripheral Processors (PPs)|''peripheral processors'']]) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive [[database]]s and files. [[Gigabyte]] to [[terabyte]]-size record files are not unusual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wintercorp.com/PressReleases/ttp2005_pressrelease_091405.htm |title=Largest Commercial Database in Winter Corp.

Other server families also offload I/O processing and emphasize throughput computing.\n\nMainframe [[return on investment]] (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors.\n\nMainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for [[fault tolerant]] computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads \"in flight\" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP's [[NonStop (server computers)|NonStop]] systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their \"steps\" (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Current market==\n[[IBM]], with [[IBM zEnterprise System|z Systems]], continues to be a major manufacturer in the mainframe market. [[Unisys]] manufactures [[Burroughs large systems|ClearPath Libra]] mainframes, based on earlier [[Burroughs MCP]] products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on [[UNIVAC|Sperry Univac]] [[OS 2200|OS 1100]] product lines. In 2000, [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] co-developed the [[zSeries]] z900 with IBM to share expenses, but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models. [[Hewlett-Packard]] sells its unique [[NonStop (server computers)|NonStop]] systems, which it acquired with [[Tandem Computers]] and which some analysts classify as mainframes. [[Groupe Bull]]'s [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GCOS]], [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] [[OpenVOS]], [[Fujitsu]] (formerly Siemens) [[BS2000]], and Fujitsu-[[ICL VME]] mainframes are still available in Europe, and Fujitsu (formerly Amdahl) [[Amdahl Corporation|GS21]] mainframes globally. [[NEC]] with [[Advanced Comprehensive Operating System|ACOS]] and Hitachi with AP10000-VOS3<ref>[http://www.hitachi.co.jp/AP/ Hitachi AP10000 - VOS3]</ref> still maintain mainframe hardware businesses in the Japanese market.\n\nThe amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share. Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S/390-compatible processors, as well as other CPUs (including POWER and Xeon) for lower-end systems. Bull uses a mixture of [[Itanium]] and [[Xeon]] processors. NEC uses Xeon processors for its low-end ACOS-2 line, but develops the custom NOAH-6 processor for its high-end ACOS-4 series. IBM also develops custom processors in-house, such as the [[IBM zEnterprise System#zEnterprise EC12|zEC12]]. Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet-sized mainframes that utilize homegrown CPUs as well as [[Xeon]] processors. Furthermore, there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations. In addition to IBM, significant players in this market include [[BMC Software|BMC]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Automation Management|url=http://www.bmc.com/solutions/msm-functional/mf-automation-management.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> [[Compuware]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Modernization|url=http://www.compuware.com/mainframe-solutions/workbench-mainframe-modernization.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Automated Mainframe Testing & Auditing|url=http://www.compuware.com/en_us/mainframe-solutions/products/hiperstation-automated-mainframe-testing.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> and [[CA Technologies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CA Technologies|url=https://www.ca.com/us/why-ca/mainframe.html}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:IBM 704 mainframe.gif|right|thumb|280px|An [[IBM 704]] mainframe (1964)]]\n\nSeveral manufacturers and their successors produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s until the early 21st Century, with gradually decreasing numbers and a gradual transition to simulation on Intel chips rather than proprietary hardware. The US group of manufacturers was first known as \"[[BUNCH|IBM and the Seven Dwarfs]]\":<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergin|first=Thomas J (ed.)|title=50 Years of Army Computing: From ENIAC to MSRC|year=2000|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-9702316-1-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAr_Z1B494MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|p.83}} usually [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[UNIVAC]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]], [[Honeywell Corporation|Honeywell]], [[General Electric]] and [[RCA]], although some lists varied. Later, with the departure of General Electric and RCA, it was referred to as IBM and the [[BUNCH]]. IBM's dominance grew out of their [[IBM 700/7000 series|700/7000 series]] and, later, the development of the [[System/360|360]] series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and Sperry (now [[Unisys]]) [[Burroughs large systems|MCP]]-based and [[OS 2200|OS1100]] mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. While IBM's zSeries can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit zSeries and System z9 CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the US were [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Telefunken]] in [[Germany]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Olivetti]] in Italy, and [[Fujitsu]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Oki Electric Industry|Oki]], and [[NEC]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the [[Cold War]]; the [[BESM]] series and [[Strela computer|Strela]] are examples of an independently designed Soviet computer.\n\nShrinking demand and tough competition started a [[shakeout]] in the market in the early 1970s\u2014RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by [[Bull (company)|Bull]]; UNIVAC became a division of [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]], which later merged with Burroughs to form [[Unisys]] Corporation in 1986.\n\nIn 1984 estimated sales of desktop computers ($11.6 billion) exceeded mainframe computers ($11.4 billion) for the first time. IBM received the vast majority of mainframe revenue.<ref name=\"sanger19840205\">{{Cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/05/business/bailing-out-of-the-mainframe-industry.html |title=Bailing Out of the Mainframe Industry |date=1984-02-05 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2020-03-02 |page=Section 3, Page 1 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower-end of the mainframes. These computers, sometimes called ''departmental computers'' were typified by the DEC [[VAX]].\n\nIn 1991, [[AT&T Corporation]] briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by [[personal computer]]s. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. [[InfoWorld]]'s [[Stewart Alsop II|Stewart Alsop]] infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe \"will stop working on December 31, 1999\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Also|first=Stewart|title=IBM still has brains to be player in client/server platforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&vq=death%20mainframe&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q=death%20mainframe&f=false|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=Mar 8, 1993}}</ref> a reference to the anticipated [[Year 2000 problem]] (Y2K).\n\nThat trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of [[e-business]] also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large-scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the [[Linux]] operating system, which [[Linux on IBM Z|arrived on IBM mainframe systems]] in 1999 and is typically run in scores or up to c. 8,000 virtual machines on a single mainframe. Linux allows users to take advantage of [[open source software]] combined with mainframe hardware [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|RAS]]. Rapid expansion and development in [[emerging markets]], particularly [[People's Republic of China]], is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit [[z/Architecture]], acquired numerous software companies such as [[Cognos]] and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's [[IBM System z|System z]] hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/4q09/presentation/4q09prepared.pdf|title=IBM 4Q2009 Financial Report: CFO's Prepared Remarks|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words (\"death of the mainframe\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Stewart Alsop eating his words|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/182/734|work=Computer History Museum|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[NASA]] powered down its last mainframe, an IBM System z9.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cureton|first=Linda|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/NASA-CIO-Blog/2012/02/12/post_1329017818806/|title=The End of the Mainframe Era at NASA|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> However, IBM's successor to the z9, the [[IBM System z10|z10]], led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that \"mainframe technology\u2014hardware, software and services\u2014remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M., and mainframes are still the back-office engines behind the world's financial markets and much of global commerce\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |title=Why Old Technologies Are Still Kicking |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/technology/23digi.html |accessdate=Dec 25, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> {{As of|2010}}, while mainframe technology represented less than 3% of IBM's revenues, it \"continue[d] to play an outsized role in Big Blue's results\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ante|first=Spencer E.|title=IBM Calculates New Mainframes Into Its Future Sales Growth|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703954804575381482738207168|accessdate=Dec 25, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, IBM launched the [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/08/21/from-ibm-mainframe-users-group-to-apple-welcome-ibm-seriously-this-week-in-tech-history/#5a66bba2781f|title=From IBM Mainframe Users Group To Apple 'Welcome IBM.

Mainframe computers are often used as servers.\n\n==Design==\nModern mainframe design is characterized less by raw computational speed and more by:\n* Redundant internal engineering resulting in high reliability and security\n* Extensive input-output (\"I/O\") facilities with the ability to offload to separate engines\n* Strict [[backward compatibility]] with older software\n* High hardware and computational utilization rates through virtualization to support massive [[throughput]].\n*[[Hot swapping|Hot-swapping of hardware]], such as processors and memory.\n\nTheir high stability and reliability enable these machines to run uninterrupted for very long periods of time, with [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF) measured in decades.\n\nMainframes have [[high availability]], one of the primary reasons for their longevity, since they are typically used in applications where downtime would be costly or catastrophic. The term [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|reliability, availability and serviceability]] (RAS) is a defining characteristic of mainframe computers. Proper planning and implementation are required to realize these features. In addition, mainframes are more secure than other computer types: the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] vulnerabilities database, [[US-CERT]], rates traditional mainframes such as IBM Z (previously called z Systems, System z and zSeries), Unisys Dorado and Unisys Libra as among the most secure with vulnerabilities in the low single digits as compared with thousands for [[Windows]], [[UNIX]], and [[Linux]].<ref>{{cite web |title=National Vulnerability Database|accessdate=September 20, 2011 |url=http://nvd.nist.gov/home.cfm}}</ref> Software upgrades usually require setting up the [[operating system]] or portions thereof, and are non-disruptive only when using [[Virtualization|virtualizing]] facilities such as IBM [[z/OS]] and [[IBM Parallel Sysplex|Parallel Sysplex]], or Unisys XPCL, which support workload sharing so that one system can take over another's application while it is being refreshed.\n\nIn the late 1950s, mainframes had only a rudimentary interactive interface (the console) and used sets of [[punched cards]], [[Punched tape|paper tape]], or [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tape]] to transfer data and programs. They operated in [[batch processing|batch]] mode to support [[back office]] functions such as payroll and customer billing, most of which were based on repeated tape-based [[Merge sort|sorting and merging]] operations followed by [[line printer|line printing]] to preprinted [[continuous stationery]]. When interactive user terminals were introduced, they were used almost exclusively for applications (e.g. [[Computer reservations system|airline booking]]) rather than program development. [[IBM 2741|Typewriter]] and [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]] devices were common control consoles for system operators through the early 1970s, although ultimately supplanted by [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]/[[Display device|display]] devices.\n\nBy the early 1970s, many mainframes acquired interactive user terminals<ref group=NB> Some had been introduced in the 1960s, but their deployment became more common in the 1970s</ref> operating as [[timesharing]] computers, supporting hundreds of users simultaneously along with batch processing. Users gained access through keyboard/typewriter terminals and specialized text [[Computer terminal|terminal]] [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] displays with integral keyboards, or later from [[personal computer]]s equipped with [[terminal emulation]] software. By the 1980s, many mainframes supported graphic display terminals, and terminal emulation, but not graphical user interfaces. This form of end-user computing became obsolete in the 1990s due to the advent of personal computers provided with [[GUI]]s. After 2000, modern mainframes partially or entirely phased out classic \"[[Monochrome monitor|green screen]]\" and color display terminal access for end-users in favour of Web-style user interfaces.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe infrastructure requirements were drastically reduced during the mid-1990s, when [[CMOS]] mainframe designs replaced the older [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] technology. IBM claimed that its newer mainframes reduced data center energy costs for power and cooling, and reduced physical space requirements compared to [[server farms]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Get the facts on IBM vs the Competition- The facts about IBM System z \"mainframe\" |publisher=IBM |accessdate=December 28, 2009 |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/migratetoibm/getthefacts/mainframe.html#4}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Inside Z9 2094.jpg|right|thumb|280px|Inside an [[IBM System z9]] mainframe]]\n\nModern mainframes can run multiple different instances of operating systems at the same time. This technique of [[virtual machine]]s allows applications to run as if they were on physically distinct computers. In this role, a single mainframe can replace higher-functioning hardware services available to conventional [[Server (computing)|servers]]. While mainframes pioneered this capability, virtualization is now available on most families of computer systems, though not always to the same degree or level of sophistication.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2551154/virtualization/emulation-or-virtualization-.html|title=Emulation or Virtualization?}}</ref>\n\nMainframes can add or [[hot swap]] system capacity without disrupting system function, with specificity and granularity to a level of sophistication not usually available with most server solutions.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} Modern mainframes, notably the IBM [[zSeries]], [[IBM System z9|System z9]] and [[IBM System z10|System z10]] servers, offer two levels of [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]]: logical partitions ([[LPAR]]s, via the [[PR/SM]] facility) and virtual machines (via the [[z/VM]] operating system). Many mainframe customers run two machines: one in their primary data center and one in their [[disaster recovery|backup data center]]\u2014fully active, partially active, or on standby\u2014in case there is a catastrophe affecting the first building. Test, development, training, and production workload for applications and databases can run on a single machine, except for extremely large demands where the capacity of one machine might be limiting. Such a two-mainframe installation can support continuous business service, avoiding both planned and unplanned outages. In practice many customers use multiple mainframes linked either by [[Parallel Sysplex]] and shared [[Direct access storage device|DASD]] (in IBM's case),{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} or with shared, geographically dispersed storage provided by EMC or Hitachi.\n\nMainframes are designed to handle very high volume input and output (I/O) and emphasize throughput computing. Since the late 1950s,<ref group=NB>E.g., the [[IBM 709]] had channels in 1958</ref> mainframe designs have included subsidiary hardware<ref group=NB>sometimes computers, sometimes more limited</ref> (called [[System/360#Channels|''channels'']] or [[CDC 6600#Peripheral Processors (PPs)|''peripheral processors'']]) which manage the I/O devices, leaving the CPU free to deal only with high-speed memory. It is common in mainframe shops to deal with massive [[database]]s and files. [[Gigabyte]] to [[terabyte]]-size record files are not unusual.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wintercorp.com/PressReleases/ttp2005_pressrelease_091405.htm |title=Largest Commercial Database in Winter Corp.

Other server families also offload I/O processing and emphasize throughput computing.\n\nMainframe [[return on investment]] (ROI), like any other computing platform, is dependent on its ability to scale, support mixed workloads, reduce labor costs, deliver uninterrupted service for critical business applications, and several other risk-adjusted cost factors.\n\nMainframes also have execution integrity characteristics for [[fault tolerant]] computing. For example, z900, z990, System z9, and System z10 servers effectively execute result-oriented instructions twice, compare results, arbitrate between any differences (through instruction retry and failure isolation), then shift workloads \"in flight\" to functioning processors, including spares, without any impact to operating systems, applications, or users. This hardware-level feature, also found in HP's [[NonStop (server computers)|NonStop]] systems, is known as lock-stepping, because both processors take their \"steps\" (i.e. instructions) together. Not all applications absolutely need the assured integrity that these systems provide, but many do, such as financial transaction processing.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Current market==\n[[IBM]], with [[IBM zEnterprise System|z Systems]], continues to be a major manufacturer in the mainframe market. [[Unisys]] manufactures [[Burroughs large systems|ClearPath Libra]] mainframes, based on earlier [[Burroughs MCP]] products and ClearPath Dorado mainframes based on [[UNIVAC|Sperry Univac]] [[OS 2200|OS 1100]] product lines. In 2000, [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] co-developed the [[zSeries]] z900 with IBM to share expenses, but subsequently the two companies have not collaborated on new Hitachi models. [[Hewlett-Packard]] sells its unique [[NonStop (server computers)|NonStop]] systems, which it acquired with [[Tandem Computers]] and which some analysts classify as mainframes. [[Groupe Bull]]'s [[General Comprehensive Operating System|GCOS]], [[Stratus Technologies|Stratus]] [[OpenVOS]], [[Fujitsu]] (formerly Siemens) [[BS2000]], and Fujitsu-[[ICL VME]] mainframes are still available in Europe, and Fujitsu (formerly Amdahl) [[Amdahl Corporation|GS21]] mainframes globally. [[NEC]] with [[Advanced Comprehensive Operating System|ACOS]] and Hitachi with AP10000-VOS3<ref>[http://www.hitachi.co.jp/AP/ Hitachi AP10000 - VOS3]</ref> still maintain mainframe hardware businesses in the Japanese market.\n\nThe amount of vendor investment in mainframe development varies with market share. Fujitsu and Hitachi both continue to use custom S/390-compatible processors, as well as other CPUs (including POWER and Xeon) for lower-end systems. Bull uses a mixture of [[Itanium]] and [[Xeon]] processors. NEC uses Xeon processors for its low-end ACOS-2 line, but develops the custom NOAH-6 processor for its high-end ACOS-4 series. IBM also develops custom processors in-house, such as the [[IBM zEnterprise System#zEnterprise EC12|zEC12]]. Unisys produces code compatible mainframe systems that range from laptops to cabinet-sized mainframes that utilize homegrown CPUs as well as [[Xeon]] processors. Furthermore, there exists a market for software applications to manage the performance of mainframe implementations. In addition to IBM, significant players in this market include [[BMC Software|BMC]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Automation Management|url=http://www.bmc.com/solutions/msm-functional/mf-automation-management.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> [[Compuware]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Mainframe Modernization|url=http://www.compuware.com/mainframe-solutions/workbench-mainframe-modernization.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Automated Mainframe Testing & Auditing|url=http://www.compuware.com/en_us/mainframe-solutions/products/hiperstation-automated-mainframe-testing.html|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> and [[CA Technologies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=CA Technologies|url=https://www.ca.com/us/why-ca/mainframe.html}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2008}}\n\n[[File:IBM 704 mainframe.gif|right|thumb|280px|An [[IBM 704]] mainframe (1964)]]\n\nSeveral manufacturers and their successors produced mainframe computers from the late 1950s until the early 21st Century, with gradually decreasing numbers and a gradual transition to simulation on Intel chips rather than proprietary hardware. The US group of manufacturers was first known as \"[[BUNCH|IBM and the Seven Dwarfs]]\":<ref>{{cite book|last=Bergin|first=Thomas J (ed.)|title=50 Years of Army Computing: From ENIAC to MSRC|year=2000|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0-9702316-1-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAr_Z1B494MC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>{{rp|p.83}} usually [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]], [[UNIVAC]], [[NCR Corporation|NCR]], [[Control Data Corporation|Control Data]], [[Honeywell Corporation|Honeywell]], [[General Electric]] and [[RCA]], although some lists varied. Later, with the departure of General Electric and RCA, it was referred to as IBM and the [[BUNCH]]. IBM's dominance grew out of their [[IBM 700/7000 series|700/7000 series]] and, later, the development of the [[System/360|360]] series mainframes. The latter architecture has continued to evolve into their current zSeries mainframes which, along with the then Burroughs and Sperry (now [[Unisys]]) [[Burroughs large systems|MCP]]-based and [[OS 2200|OS1100]] mainframes, are among the few mainframe architectures still extant that can trace their roots to this early period. While IBM's zSeries can still run 24-bit System/360 code, the 64-bit zSeries and System z9 CMOS servers have nothing physically in common with the older systems. Notable manufacturers outside the US were [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] and [[Telefunken]] in [[Germany]], [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Olivetti]] in Italy, and [[Fujitsu]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]], [[Oki Electric Industry|Oki]], and [[NEC]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Soviet Union]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries manufactured close copies of IBM mainframes during the [[Cold War]]; the [[BESM]] series and [[Strela computer|Strela]] are examples of an independently designed Soviet computer.\n\nShrinking demand and tough competition started a [[shakeout]] in the market in the early 1970s\u2014RCA sold out to UNIVAC and GE sold its business to Honeywell; between 1986 and 1990 Honeywell was bought out by [[Bull (company)|Bull]]; UNIVAC became a division of [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]], which later merged with Burroughs to form [[Unisys]] Corporation in 1986.\n\nIn 1984 estimated sales of desktop computers ($11.6 billion) exceeded mainframe computers ($11.4 billion) for the first time. IBM received the vast majority of mainframe revenue.<ref name=\"sanger19840205\">{{Cite news |last=Sanger |first=David E. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/05/business/bailing-out-of-the-mainframe-industry.html |title=Bailing Out of the Mainframe Industry |date=1984-02-05 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2020-03-02 |page=Section 3, Page 1 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> During the 1980s, [[minicomputer]]-based systems grew more sophisticated and were able to displace the lower-end of the mainframes. These computers, sometimes called ''departmental computers'' were typified by the DEC [[VAX]].\n\nIn 1991, [[AT&T Corporation]] briefly owned NCR. During the same period, companies found that servers based on microcomputer designs could be deployed at a fraction of the acquisition price and offer local users much greater control over their own systems given the IT policies and practices at that time. Terminals used for interacting with mainframe systems were gradually replaced by [[personal computer]]s. Consequently, demand plummeted and new mainframe installations were restricted mainly to financial services and government. In the early 1990s, there was a rough consensus among industry analysts that the mainframe was a dying market as mainframe platforms were increasingly replaced by personal computer networks. [[InfoWorld]]'s [[Stewart Alsop II|Stewart Alsop]] infamously predicted that the last mainframe would be unplugged in 1996; in 1993, he cited Cheryl Currid, a computer industry analyst as saying that the last mainframe \"will stop working on December 31, 1999\",<ref>{{cite news|last=Also|first=Stewart|title=IBM still has brains to be player in client/server platforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTwEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&vq=death%20mainframe&pg=PA4#v=onepage&q=death%20mainframe&f=false|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013|newspaper=InfoWorld|date=Mar 8, 1993}}</ref> a reference to the anticipated [[Year 2000 problem]] (Y2K).\n\nThat trend started to turn around in the late 1990s as corporations found new uses for their existing mainframes and as the price of data networking collapsed in most parts of the world, encouraging trends toward more centralized computing. The growth of [[e-business]] also dramatically increased the number of back-end transactions processed by mainframe software as well as the size and throughput of databases. Batch processing, such as billing, became even more important (and larger) with the growth of e-business, and mainframes are particularly adept at large-scale batch computing. Another factor currently increasing mainframe use is the development of the [[Linux]] operating system, which [[Linux on IBM Z|arrived on IBM mainframe systems]] in 1999 and is typically run in scores or up to c. 8,000 virtual machines on a single mainframe. Linux allows users to take advantage of [[open source software]] combined with mainframe hardware [[Reliability, availability and serviceability (computer hardware)|RAS]]. Rapid expansion and development in [[emerging markets]], particularly [[People's Republic of China]], is also spurring major mainframe investments to solve exceptionally difficult computing problems, e.g. providing unified, extremely high volume online transaction processing databases for 1 billion consumers across multiple industries (banking, insurance, credit reporting, government services, etc.) In late 2000, IBM introduced 64-bit [[z/Architecture]], acquired numerous software companies such as [[Cognos]] and introduced those software products to the mainframe. IBM's quarterly and annual reports in the 2000s usually reported increasing mainframe revenues and capacity shipments. However, IBM's mainframe hardware business has not been immune to the recent overall downturn in the server hardware market or to model cycle effects. For example, in the 4th quarter of 2009, IBM's [[IBM System z|System z]] hardware revenues decreased by 27% year over year. But MIPS (millions of instructions per second) shipments increased 4% per year over the past two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/4q09/presentation/4q09prepared.pdf|title=IBM 4Q2009 Financial Report: CFO's Prepared Remarks|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=January 19, 2010}}</ref> Alsop had himself photographed in 2000, symbolically eating his own words (\"death of the mainframe\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Stewart Alsop eating his words|url=http://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/182/734|work=Computer History Museum|accessdate=Dec 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, [[NASA]] powered down its last mainframe, an IBM System z9.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cureton|first=Linda|url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/NASA-CIO-Blog/2012/02/12/post_1329017818806/|title=The End of the Mainframe Era at NASA|publisher=[[NASA]]|date=11 February 2012|accessdate=31 January 2014}}</ref> However, IBM's successor to the z9, the [[IBM System z10|z10]], led a New York Times reporter to state four years earlier that \"mainframe technology\u2014hardware, software and services\u2014remains a large and lucrative business for I.B.M., and mainframes are still the back-office engines behind the world's financial markets and much of global commerce\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Lohr |first=Steve |title=Why Old Technologies Are Still Kicking |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/technology/23digi.html |accessdate=Dec 25, 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> {{As of|2010}}, while mainframe technology represented less than 3% of IBM's revenues, it \"continue[d] to play an outsized role in Big Blue's results\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ante|first=Spencer E.|title=IBM Calculates New Mainframes Into Its Future Sales Growth|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052748703954804575381482738207168|accessdate=Dec 25, 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 22, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, IBM launched the [[IBM z13 (microprocessor)|IBM z13]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2016/08/21/from-ibm-mainframe-users-group-to-apple-welcome-ibm-seriously-this-week-in-tech-history/#5a66bba2781f|title=From IBM Mainframe Users Group To Apple 'Welcome IBM.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent.

''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]].

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''.

This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D.

Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates.

Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1986) [1981].

Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House.</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|title=Friedrich Hayek: A Biography|year=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226181509}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tebble|first1=Adam|last2=Meadowcroft|first2=John|title=F.A.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]].

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger. {{ISBN|9780582500150}}.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (September 1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series. {{ISBN|9780812004038}}.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate. {{ISBN|9780754636571}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510. {{ISBN|9780140806229}}.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971). \"The Maoist Economic Model\".

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Economic challenges and legacy ===\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998).

New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362. {{ISBN|9780415919678}}.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited.

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era.

As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|year=2009|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221469}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far. They allowed important political and economic gains to be made by workers, encouraged land redistribution, unseated oligarchical political powers and implemented [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substituting]] industrialization development strategies.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 as well as the push for [[democratization]], many Arab states have moved toward a model of fiscal discipline proposed by the [[Washington Consensus]].<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Although authoritarian leaders of those states implemented democratic institutions during the 1980s and 1990s, their multi-party elections created an arena in which business elites could lobby for personal interests while largely silencing the lower class.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/> Economic liberalization in these regions yielded economies that led to regimes built on the support of rent-seeking urban elites, with political opposition inviting the prospect of political marginalization and even retaliation.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\"/>\n\n==== Resistance to democratization ====\n[[File:WOSM-WAGGGS-Arab Region.svg|thumb|[[Arab world]]]]\nA great deal of debate has been paid by the field of comparative politics to how the Arab region was able to avoid the [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave of democratization]]. A number of arguments have been offered by professionals in the field, ranging from a discussion of [[Democratization|prerequisites]] not supported by the [[Arab culture]] to a lack of democratic actors initiating the necessary democratic transition.\n\nMarsha Pripstein Posusney argues that the \"patriarchal and tribal mentality of the culture is an impediment to the development of pluralist values\", rendering Arab citizens prone to accept patriarchal leaders and lacking the national unity that many argue is necessary for democratization to be successful.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\">{{cite book|last=Posusney|first=Marsha Pripstein|title=Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance|date=2005|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|location=Boulder|isbn=978-1-58826-317-9}}</ref> Eva Bellin concedes that the prevalence of [[Islam]] is a distinguishing factor of the region and therefore must contribute to the region's exceptionalism, \"given Islam's presumed inhospitality to democracy\".<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Posusney argues that this \"intrinsic incompatibility between democracy and Islam\" remains unproven given that efforts to test this association quantitatively have failed to produce conclusive results.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/> Ethnic divisions in the area have also been cited as a factor as well as a weak civil society, a state-controlled economy, poverty, low literacy rates and inequality.<ref name=\"Regimes and Resistance\"/><ref name=\"Debating\">{{cite book|last=Schlumberger|first=Oliver|title=Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes|date=2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|isbn=978-0-8047-5776-8}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''Debating Arab Authoritarianism: Dynamics and Durability in Nondemocratic Regimes'', Oliver Schlumberger has argued that there is in fact an international ambivalence toward authoritarianism in the Middle East given that stability is preferred over the uncertainty of democratization due to the region's oil and gas supplies and the strategic importance of its geopolitical location.<ref name=\"Debating\"/>\n\n=== Africa ===\n{{see also|African socialism}}\n[[File:L\u00e9opold Senghor, Pic, 5.jpg|thumb|150px|[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]]]]\nDuring the [[Pan-African Congress|1945 Pan-African Conference]], calls for increased organization, development and self-determination in the poverty stricken African continent put the impetus on colonial powers to negotiate [[national sovereignty]].<ref name=\"Mushkat\">{{cite journal|last=Mushkat|first=Marion|title=African Socialism Reappraised and Reconsidered|journal=Istituto Italiano per l'Africa e l'Oriente|date=June 1972|volume=2|pages=151\u2013153}}</ref> While there were few Marxist movements into the continent, Soviet Union activity spurred anti-imperialist and globalization movements from African countries.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

Austrian School economists such as Mises and Hayek continually used ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism and its [[command economy]].<ref name=\"Hayek\"/><ref name=\"Mises\"/> The attributive ''state'' is usually added by socialists with a non-state based method for achieving socialism to criticize state socialism.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin (1985).
