are the contributions within [[Turkey]] to the emission of [[greenhouse gasses]] such as [[carbon dioxide]] or [[ hydrofluorocarbons]]. Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by sector, such as looking specifically at [[List of power stations in Turkey|Turkey's power stations]] or transport. In addition, the natural and [[Agriculture in Turkey|agricultural landscape of Turkey]] contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with methane and [[N2O|N<sub>2</sub>O]] from agriculture more than offset by carbon dioxide trapped in forests, thus slightly reducing Turkey's overall emissions. [[Energy policy of Turkey|Turkey's policies on energy]], industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cows and construction vented about half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey in 2018, but almost a fifth was absorbed by trees.

According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as {{transl|ja|otaku}},<ref name=\"mynavi\"/> both in Japan and elsewhere.\n\n{{transl|ja|Otaku}} subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of {{transl|ja|otaku}} traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the release of works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' before it branched into [[Comic Market]]. The {{transl|ja|otaku}}  subculture continued to grow with the expansion of the internet and media, as more anime, video games, shows, and comics were created.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okamoto|first=Takeshi|date=2014|title=Otaku Tourism and the Anime Pilgrimage Phenomenon in Japan|journal=Japan Forum|volume=27|pages=12\u201336|doi=10.1080/09555803.2014.962565}}</ref> The definition of {{transl|ja|otaku}} subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of {{transl|ja|otaku}} emerged. In 2005, the [[Nomura Research Institute]] divided {{transl|ja|otaku}} into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single {{transl|ja|otaku}} interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, [[Japanese idol|idol]] and electronics {{transl|ja|otaku}}. The economic impact of {{transl|ja|otaku}} has been estimated to be as high as \u00a52 trillion ($18 billion).<ref name=money />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{transl|ja|Otaku}} is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ([[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]], {{transl|ja|otaku}}). This word is often used metaphorically, as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is \"you\". For example, early in the anime ''[[Macross]]'', first aired in 1982, the characters [[Hikaru Ichijyo]] and [[Lynn Minmay]] use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better.<ref name=\"NRI\"/><ref name=\"SDFMeps3and4\"/> The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f), [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af) or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]]. His 1983 series {{nihongo|''Research for \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]'', applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> Morikawa Kaichir\u014d, an author and lecturer at [[Meiji University]], identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.<ref name=\"essay\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Otaku Encyclopedia|author=Patrick W. Galbraith|date=2009|publisher=Kodansha|page=14}}</ref>\n\nAnother claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author [[Motoko Arai]], who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 ''Variety'' magazine essay.<ref name=\"greece\"/>{{refn|group=Note|The source contains an excerpt of the introduction of the book ''Otaku Spaces'' by Patrick W. Galbraith. Published Spring 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9844576-5-6}}. This source was not consulted directly for this citation. An except also exists on Androniki Christodoulou's blog, the photographer of the book.}}<ref name=\"Otaku Spaces Book\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the case of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], \"The Otaku Murderer\", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention.<ref name=\"essay\" /> Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and [[slasher film]]s that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine ''Bessatsu Takarajima'' dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of {{transl|ja|otaku}}. It was called {{nihongo|''Otaku no Hon''|\u304a\u305f\u304f\u306e\u672c|lit. The Book of Otaku}} and delved into the subculture of {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 19 articles by {{transl|ja|otaku}} insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.<ref name=\"Nippon_Foundation\"/>\n\n==Usage==\nIn modern Japanese slang, the term {{transl|ja|otaku}} is mostly equivalent to \"[[geek]]\" or \"[[nerd]]\" (both broad sense; common sense of geek would be \"tech {{transl|ja|otaku}}\" ({{nihongo||\u6280\u8853\u30aa\u30bf\u30af}}) and common sense of nerd would be \"intellectual {{transl|ja|otaku}}\" ({{nihongo||\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u30aa\u30bf\u30af}}) or \"{{transl|ja|gariben}}\" ({{nihongo||\u30ac\u30ea\u52c9}})), but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West.<ref name=essay /> However, it can relate to any [[Fan (person)|fan]] of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.<ref name=essay /> \"When these people are referred to as {{transl|ja|otaku}}, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an {{transl|ja|otaku}} as a person unable to relate to reality\".<ref name=\"Otaku: Is it a dirty word?\"/><ref name=\"gizmodo\"/>  The word entered English as a [[loanword]] from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a [[Fan (person)|fan]] of [[anime]]/[[manga]] but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine ''[[Otaku USA]]'' popularizes and covers these aspects.<ref name=\"Home - Otaku USA Magazine\"/><ref name=fan /> The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of ''[[Gunbuster]]'', which refers to anime fans as {{transl|ja|otaku}}. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about ''[[Otaku no Video]]''{{'}}s portrayal of {{transl|ja|otaku}} before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed.<ref name=\"fan\"/> The term was also popularized by [[William Gibson]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Idoru]]'', which references {{transl|ja|otaku}}.<ref name=\"Modern boys and mobile girls\"/>\n\n==Sub-culture==\nMorikawa Kaichir\u014d identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a [[caste system]], but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of {{transl|ja|otaku}}. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the {{transl|ja|otaku}} subculture.<ref name=essay />\n\nEven prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of ''Fan R\u014ddo'' (Fan road) about \"culture clubs\".<ref name=\"essay\"/> These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered [[Comiket|Comic Market]], the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.<ref name=essay />\n\nThe 1989 \"Otaku Murderer\" case gave a negative connotation to the fandom from which it has not fully recovered. The usage of \"(interest) {{transl|ja|otaku}}\", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative.<ref name=essay /> The identification of {{transl|ja|otaku}} turned negative in late 2004 when [[Kaoru Kobayashi (murderer)|Kaoru Kobayashi]] kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist [[Akihiro \u014ctani]] suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed by a member of the [[figure moe zoku]] even before his arrest.<ref name=\"picnic2004\"/> Although Kobayashi was not an {{transl|ja|otaku}}, the degree of social hostility against {{transl|ja|otaku}} increased. {{transl|ja|Otaku}} were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in {{transl|ja|otaku}} materials.<ref name=\"Otaku harassed as sex-crime fears mount\"/>\n\nNot all attention has been negative. In his book, {{transl|ja|Otaku}}, [[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Hiroki Azuma]] observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the {{transl|ja|otaku}} forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan\", citing the fact that \"[i]n 2003, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Academy Award]] for his ''[[Spirited Away]]''; around the same time [[Takashi Murakami]] achieved recognition for {{transl|ja|otaku}}-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the [[9th International Architecture Exhibition|2004 International Architecture exhibition]] of the [[Venice Biennale]] ([[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale Architecture]]) featured {{transl|ja|otaku}}. In 2005, the word {{transl|ja|moe}} - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen as one of the top ten \"buzzwords of the year.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Azuma |first=Hiroki |date=April 10, 2009 |title=Otaku |chapter-url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/otaku |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press | chapter= Preface |page = xi|isbn=978-0816653515 |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref> The former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Tar\u014d As\u014d|Taro Aso]] has also claimed to be an ''otaku'', using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs.<ref name=\"Otaku uses manga and anime to improve Foreign Affairs\"/> In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of {{transl|ja|otaku}}. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.<ref name=\"mynavi\"/>\n\n===Places===\nThe district of [[Akihabara]] in Tokyo, where there are [[maid caf\u00e9]]s featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for {{transl|ja|otaku}}. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.<ref name=\"Akihabara\"/> Another popular location is [[Otome Road]] in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In [[Nagoya]], students from [[Nagoya City University]] started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the {{transl|ja|otaku}} culture to attract more {{transl|ja|otaku}} to the city.<ref name=\"japantimes\"/>\n\n===Subtypes===\nThere are specific terms for different types of {{transl|ja|otaku}}, including {{nihongo|[[Fujoshi]]|\u8150\u5973\u5b50||lit. \"rotten girl\"}}, a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of {{transl|ja|[[yaoi]]}}, which focuses on [[homosexual]] male relationships.<ref name=\"Mari\"/>  {{transl|ja|[[Reki-jo]]}} are female {{transl|ja|otaku}} who are interested in [[Japanese history]]. Some terms refer to a location, such as {{transl|ja|[[Akiba-kei]]}}, a slang term meaning \"[[Akihabara]]-style\" which applies to those familiar with Akihabara's culture.  Another is {{Nihongo|[[Wotagei]] or otagei|\u30f2\u30bf\u82b8 or \u30aa\u30bf\u82b8}}, a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei.  Other terms, such as {{nihongo|[[Itasha]]|\u75db\u8eca}}, literally \"painful car\", describe vehicles who are decorated with fictional characters, especially [[bish\u014djo game]] or [[eroge]] characters.<ref name=\"Itasha: Japan's Creepiest Car Fetish\"/><ref name=\"Behold.  A Fleet of Cars Owned by Nerds.\"/>\n\n===Media===\n{{transl|ja|Otaku}} often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga {{transl|ja|otaku}} are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as ''Otaku no Video'', which contains a live-interview [[mockumentary]] that pokes fun at the {{transl|ja|otaku}} subculture and includes [[Gainax]]'s own staff as the interviewees.<ref name=\"Buried Treasure - In Praise of Nerdiness\"/> Other works depict {{transl|ja|otaku}} subculture less critically, such as {{transl|ja|[[Genshiken]]}} and ''[[Comic Party]]''. A well-known novel-come-manga-come-anime is ''[[Welcome to the N.H.K.]]'', which focuses on the subcultures popular with {{transl|ja|otaku}} and highlights other social outcasts such as the {{transl|ja|[[hikikomori]]}} and [[NEET]]s. Works that focus on an {{transl|ja|otaku}} character include ''[[WataMote]]'', the story of an unattractive and unsociable [[otome game]] {{transl|ja|otaku}} who exhibits delusions about her social status.<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork\"/> Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', focuses on the American side of the {{transl|ja|otaku}} culture.<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork2004\"/>\n\n==Types and classification of Japanese otaku==\n[[File:Railfantokyo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Railfan]]s or [[Anorak (slang)|Anorak]]s taking photos of trains at an annual depot open-day event in Tokyo in August 2011]]\nThe Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into {{transl|ja|otaku}}, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005.<ref name=\"nri2004\"/><ref name=\"nri2005\"/> The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of {{transl|ja|otaku}} interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and \u00a583 billion market scale. [[Japanese idol|Idol]] {{transl|ja|otaku}} were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and \u00a561 billion. Travel {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 250,000 individuals and \u00a581 billion. PC {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 190,000 individuals and \u00a536 billion. Video game {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 160,000 individuals and \u00a521 billion. Automobile {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 140,000 individuals and \u00a554 billion. Animation (anime) {{transl|ja|otaku}} with 110,000 individuals and \u00a520 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 70,000 individuals and \u00a58 billion; Audio-visual equipment {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 60,000 individuals and \u00a512 billion; camera {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 50,000 individuals and \u00a518 billion; fashion {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 40,000 individuals and \u00a513 billion; and railway {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 20,000 individuals and \u00a54 billion. Healthcare {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with 4,200 individuals primarily in the Pasco county region and 2 billion yen.<ref name=\"nri2005\" /> These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the \"unique psychological characteristics\" of {{transl|ja|otaku}} used in the 2005 study.<ref name=\"nri2004\" /><ref name=\"nri2005\" />\n\nNRI's 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of {{transl|ja|otaku}}. The first is the family-oriented {{transl|ja|otaku}}, who has broad interests and is more mature than other {{transl|ja|otaku}}; their object of interest is secretive and they are \"closet {{transl|ja|otaku}}\". The second is the serious \"leaving my own mark on the world\" {{transl|ja|otaku}}, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields. The third type is the \"media-sensitive multiple interest\" {{transl|ja|otaku}}, whose diverse interests are shared with others. The fourth type is the \"outgoing and assertive {{transl|ja|otaku}}\", who gain recognition by promoting their hobby. The last is the \"fan magazine-obsessed {{transl|ja|otaku}}\", which is predominately female with a small group of males being the \"[[Moe (slang)|moe]] type\"; the secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.<ref name=\"nri2005\" /> The Hamagin Research Institute found that moe-related content was worth \u00a588.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as \u00a52 trillion ($18 billion).<ref name=\"money\"/> Japan-based ''Tokyo Otaku Mode'', a place for news relating to {{transl|ja|otaku}}, has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.<ref name=\"Tokyo Otaku Mode has 10 million Facebook fans but now what\"/>\n\nOther classifications of {{transl|ja|otaku}} interests include vocaloid, cosplay, figures and professional wrestling as categorized by the Yano Research Institute. Yano Research reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by {{transl|ja|otaku}} consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% of growth in [[dating sim]] and online gaming {{transl|ja|otaku}}, while [[vocaloid]], [[cosplay]], idols and [[Maid caf\u00e9|maid services]] grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.<ref name=\"Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2012\"/><ref name=\"Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2011\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan|Speculative fiction|Video games}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD LINKS HERE THAT ARE BROAD IN SCOPE, WORDS SUCH AS \"FAN\" and \"GEEK\" ARE ALREADY LINKED IN THE ARTICLE.-->\n* [[Anorak (slang)]]\n* ''[[Daicon III and IV Opening Animations]]''\n* [[Geek]]\n* ''[[Genshiken]]''\n* [[Japanophile]]\n* ''[[Otaku no Video]]''\n* [[Hikikomori]]\n* [[Nijikon]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Akihabara\">{{cite web | url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html | title=Akihabara | publisher=japanguide.com | date=July 24, 2013 | accessdate=August 19, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427005552/http://japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html | archive-date=April 27, 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Behold.

According to studies published in 2013, the term has become less negative, and an increasing number of people now self-identify as {{lang|ja|otaku}},<ref name=\"mynavi\"/> both in Japan and elsewhere.\n\n{{lang|ja|Otaku}} subculture is a central theme of various anime and manga works, documentaries and academic research. The subculture began in the 1980s as changing social mentalities and the nurturing of {{lang|ja|otaku}} traits by Japanese schools combined with the resignation of such individuals to become social outcasts. The subculture's birth coincided with the anime boom, after the release of works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' before it branched into [[Comic Market]]. The {{lang|ja|otaku}}  subculture continued to grow with the expansion of the internet and media, as more anime, video games, shows, and comics were created.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okamoto|first=Takeshi|date=2014|title=Otaku Tourism and the Anime Pilgrimage Phenomenon in Japan|journal=Japan Forum|volume=27|pages=12\u201336|doi=10.1080/09555803.2014.962565}}</ref> The definition of {{lang|ja|otaku}} subsequently became more complex, and numerous classifications of {{lang|ja|otaku}} emerged. In 2005, the [[Nomura Research Institute]] divided {{lang|ja|otaku}} into twelve groups and estimated the size and market impact of each of these groups. Other institutions have split it further or focus on a single {{lang|ja|otaku}} interest. These publications classify distinct groups including anime, manga, camera, automobile, [[Japanese idol|idol]] and electronics {{lang|ja|otaku}}. The economic impact of {{lang|ja|otaku}} has been estimated to be as high as \u00a52 trillion ($18 billion).<ref name=money />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{lang|ja|Otaku}} is derived from a Japanese term for another person's house or family ([[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]], {{lang|ja|otaku}}). This word is often used metaphorically, as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. In this usage, its literal translation is \"you\". For example, early in the anime ''[[Macross]]'', first aired in 1982, the characters [[Hikaru Ichijyo]] and [[Lynn Minmay]] use the term this way to address one another, until they get to know each other better.<ref name=\"NRI\"/><ref name=\"SDFMeps3and4\"/> The modern slang form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f), [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af) or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], first appeared in public discourse in the 1980s, through the work of humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]]. His 1983 series {{nihongo|''Research for \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]'', applied the term to unpleasant fans in caricature. Animators [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] had used the term between themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> Supposedly, some fans used it past the point in their relationships where others would have moved on to a less formal style. Because this misuse indicated social awkwardness, Nakamori chose the word itself to label the fans.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> Morikawa Kaichir\u014d, an author and lecturer at [[Meiji University]], identified this as the origin of its contemporary usage.<ref name=\"essay\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Otaku Encyclopedia|author=Patrick W. Galbraith|date=2009|publisher=Kodansha|page=14}}</ref>\n\nAnother claim for the origin of the term comes from the works of science fiction author [[Motoko Arai]], who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted the term for themselves. However, a different claim points to a 1981 ''Variety'' magazine essay.<ref name=\"greece\"/>{{refn|group=Note|The source contains an excerpt of the introduction of the book ''Otaku Spaces'' by Patrick W. Galbraith. Published Spring 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9844576-5-6}}. This source was not consulted directly for this citation. An except also exists on Androniki Christodoulou's blog, the photographer of the book.}}<ref name=\"Otaku Spaces Book\"/>\n\nIn 1989, the case of [[Tsutomu Miyazaki]], \"The Otaku Murderer\", brought the fandom, very negatively, to national attention.<ref name=\"essay\" /> Miyazaki, who randomly chose and murdered four girls, had a collection of 5,763 video tapes, some containing anime and [[slasher film]]s that were found interspersed with videos and pictures of his victims. Later that year, the contemporary knowledge magazine ''Bessatsu Takarajima'' dedicated its 104th issue to the topic of {{lang|ja|otaku}}. It was called {{nihongo|''Otaku no Hon''|\u304a\u305f\u304f\u306e\u672c|lit. The Book of Otaku}} and delved into the subculture of {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 19 articles by {{lang|ja|otaku}} insiders, among them Akio Nakamori. This publication has been claimed by scholar Rudyard Pesimo to have popularized the term.<ref name=\"Nippon_Foundation\"/>\n\n==Usage==\nIn modern Japanese slang, the term {{lang|ja|otaku}} is mostly equivalent to \"[[geek]]\" or \"[[nerd]]\" (both broad sense; common sense of geek would be \"tech {{lang|ja|otaku}}\" ({{nihongo||\u6280\u8853\u30aa\u30bf\u30af}}) and common sense of nerd would be \"intellectual {{lang|ja|otaku}}\" ({{nihongo||\u6587\u5316\u7cfb\u30aa\u30bf\u30af}}) or \"{{lang|ja|gariben}}\" ({{nihongo||\u30ac\u30ea\u52c9}})), but in a more derogatory manner than used in the West.<ref name=essay /> However, it can relate to any [[Fan (person)|fan]] of any particular theme, topic, hobby or form of entertainment.<ref name=essay /> \"When these people are referred to as {{lang|ja|otaku}}, they are judged for their behaviors - and people suddenly see an {{lang|ja|otaku}} as a person unable to relate to reality\".<ref name=\"Otaku: Is it a dirty word?\"/><ref name=\"gizmodo\"/>  The word entered English as a [[loanword]] from the Japanese language. It is typically used to refer to a [[Fan (person)|fan]] of [[anime]]/[[manga]] but can also refer to Japanese video games or Japanese culture in general. The American magazine ''[[Otaku USA]]'' popularizes and covers these aspects.<ref name=\"Home - Otaku USA Magazine\"/><ref name=fan /> The usage of the word is a source of contention among some fans, owing to its negative connotations and stereotyping of the fandom. Widespread English exposure to the term came in 1988 with the release of ''[[Gunbuster]]'', which refers to anime fans as {{lang|ja|otaku}}. Gunbuster was released officially in English in March 1990. The term's usage spread throughout rec.arts.anime with discussions about ''[[Otaku no Video]]''{{'}}s portrayal of {{lang|ja|otaku}} before its 1994 English release. Positive and negative aspects, including the pejorative usage, were intermixed.<ref name=\"fan\"/> The term was also popularized by [[William Gibson]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Idoru]]'', which references {{lang|ja|otaku}}.<ref name=\"Modern boys and mobile girls\"/>\n\n==Sub-culture==\nMorikawa Kaichir\u014d identifies the subculture as distinctly Japanese, a product of the school system and society. Japanese schools have a class structure which functions as a [[caste system]], but clubs are an exception to the social hierarchy. In these clubs, a student's interests will be recognized and nurtured, catering to the interests of {{lang|ja|otaku}}. Secondly, the vertical structure of Japanese society identifies the value of individuals by their success. Until the late 1980s, unathletic and unattractive males focused on academics, hoping to secure a good job and marry to raise their social standing. Those unable to succeed socially focused instead on their interests, often into adulthood, with their lifestyle centering on those interests, furthering the creation of the {{lang|ja|otaku}} subculture.<ref name=essay />\n\nEven prior to the coinage of the term, the stereotypical traits of the subculture were identified in a 1981 issue of ''Fan R\u014ddo'' (Fan road) about \"culture clubs\".<ref name=\"essay\"/> These individuals were drawn to anime, a counter-culture, with the release of hard science fiction works such as ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]''. These works allowed a congregation and development of obsessive interests that turned anime into a medium for unpopular students, catering to obsessed fans. After these fans discovered [[Comiket|Comic Market]], the term was used as a self-confirming and self-mocking collective identity.<ref name=essay />\n\nThe 1989 \"Otaku Murderer\" case gave a negative connotation to the fandom from which it has not fully recovered. The usage of \"(interest) {{lang|ja|otaku}}\", however, is used for teasing or self-deprecation, but the unqualified term remains negative.<ref name=essay /> The identification of {{lang|ja|otaku}} turned negative in late 2004 when [[Kaoru Kobayashi (murderer)|Kaoru Kobayashi]] kidnapped, sexually assaulted, and murdered a seven-year-old first-grade student. Japanese journalist [[Akihiro \u014ctani]] suspected that Kobayashi's crime was committed by a member of the [[figure moe zoku]] even before his arrest.<ref name=\"picnic2004\"/> Although Kobayashi was not an {{lang|ja|otaku}}, the degree of social hostility against {{lang|ja|otaku}} increased. {{lang|ja|Otaku}} were seen by law enforcement as possible suspects for sex crimes, and local governments called for stricter laws controlling the depiction of eroticism in {{lang|ja|otaku}} materials.<ref name=\"Otaku harassed as sex-crime fears mount\"/>\n\nNot all attention has been negative. In his book, {{lang|ja|Otaku}}, [[Hiroki Azuma (critic)|Hiroki Azuma]] observed: \"Between 2001 and 2007, the {{lang|ja|otaku}} forms and markets quite rapidly won social recognition in Japan\", citing the fact that \"[i]n 2003, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Academy Award]] for his ''[[Spirited Away]]''; around the same time [[Takashi Murakami]] achieved recognition for {{lang|ja|otaku}}-like designs; in 2004, the Japanese pavilion in the [[9th International Architecture Exhibition|2004 International Architecture exhibition]] of the [[Venice Biennale]] ([[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale Architecture]]) featured {{lang|ja|otaku}}. In 2005, the word {{lang|ja|moe}} - one of the keywords of the present volume - was chosen as one of the top ten \"buzzwords of the year.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Azuma |first=Hiroki |date=April 10, 2009 |title=Otaku |chapter-url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/otaku |location=Minneapolis |publisher=University of Minnesota Press | chapter= Preface |page = xi|isbn=978-0816653515 |accessdate=January 31, 2014}}</ref> The former [[Prime Minister of Japan]] [[Tar\u014d As\u014d|Taro Aso]] has also claimed to be an ''otaku'', using this subculture to promote Japan in foreign affairs.<ref name=\"Otaku uses manga and anime to improve Foreign Affairs\"/> In 2013, a Japanese study of 137,734 people found that 42.2% self-identify as a type of {{lang|ja|otaku}}. This study suggests that the stigma of the word has vanished, and the term has been embraced by many.<ref name=\"mynavi\"/>\n\n===Places===\nThe district of [[Akihabara]] in Tokyo, where there are [[maid caf\u00e9]]s featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for {{lang|ja|otaku}}. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, retro video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles.<ref name=\"Akihabara\"/> Another popular location is [[Otome Road]] in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In [[Nagoya]], students from [[Nagoya City University]] started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the {{lang|ja|otaku}} culture to attract more {{lang|ja|otaku}} to the city.<ref name=\"japantimes\"/>\n\n===Subtypes===\nThere are specific terms for different types of {{lang|ja|otaku}}, including {{nihongo|[[Fujoshi]]|\u8150\u5973\u5b50||lit. \"rotten girl\"}}, a self-mockingly pejorative Japanese term for female fans of {{lang|ja|[[yaoi]]}}, which focuses on [[homosexual]] male relationships.<ref name=\"Mari\"/>  {{lang|ja|[[Reki-jo]]}} are female {{lang|ja|otaku}} who are interested in [[Japanese history]]. Some terms refer to a location, such as {{lang|ja|[[Akiba-kei]]}}, a slang term meaning \"[[Akihabara]]-style\" which applies to those familiar with Akihabara's culture.  Another is {{Nihongo|[[Wotagei]] or otagei|\u30f2\u30bf\u82b8 or \u30aa\u30bf\u82b8}}, a type of cheering that is part of Akiba-kei.  Other terms, such as {{nihongo|[[Itasha]]|\u75db\u8eca}}, literally \"painful car\", describe vehicles who are decorated with fictional characters, especially [[bish\u014djo game]] or [[eroge]] characters.<ref name=\"Itasha: Japan's Creepiest Car Fetish\"/><ref name=\"Behold.  A Fleet of Cars Owned by Nerds.\"/>\n\n===Media===\n{{lang|ja|Otaku}} often participate in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga {{lang|ja|otaku}} are the subject of numerous self-critical works, such as ''Otaku no Video'', which contains a live-interview [[mockumentary]] that pokes fun at the {{lang|ja|otaku}} subculture and includes [[Gainax]]'s own staff as the interviewees.<ref name=\"Buried Treasure - In Praise of Nerdiness\"/> Other works depict {{lang|ja|otaku}} subculture less critically, such as {{lang|ja|[[Genshiken]]}} and ''[[Comic Party]]''. A well-known novel-come-manga-come-anime is ''[[Welcome to the N.H.K.]]'', which focuses on the subcultures popular with {{lang|ja|otaku}} and highlights other social outcasts such as the {{lang|ja|[[hikikomori]]}} and [[NEET]]s. Works that focus on an {{lang|ja|otaku}} character include ''[[WataMote]]'', the story of an unattractive and unsociable [[otome game]] {{lang|ja|otaku}} who exhibits delusions about her social status.<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork\"/> Watamote is a self-mocking insight that follows the heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, ''[[Otaku Unite!]]'', focuses on the American side of the {{lang|ja|otaku}} culture.<ref name=\"animenewsnetwork2004\"/>\n\n==Types and classification of Japanese otaku==\n[[File:Railfantokyo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Railfan]]s or [[Anorak (slang)|Anorak]]s taking photos of trains at an annual depot open-day event in Tokyo in August 2011]]\nThe Nomura Research Institute (NRI) has made two major studies into {{lang|ja|otaku}}, the first in 2004 and a revised study with a more specific definition in 2005.<ref name=\"nri2004\"/><ref name=\"nri2005\"/> The 2005 study defines twelve major fields of {{lang|ja|otaku}} interests. Of these groups, manga (Japanese comics) was the largest, with 350,000 individuals and \u00a583 billion market scale. [[Japanese idol|Idol]] {{lang|ja|otaku}} were the next largest group, with 280,000 individuals and \u00a561 billion. Travel {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 250,000 individuals and \u00a581 billion. PC {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 190,000 individuals and \u00a536 billion. Video game {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 160,000 individuals and \u00a521 billion. Automobile {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 140,000 individuals and \u00a554 billion. Animation (anime) {{lang|ja|otaku}} with 110,000 individuals and \u00a520 billion. The remaining five categories include Mobile IT equipment {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 70,000 individuals and \u00a58 billion; Audio-visual equipment {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 60,000 individuals and \u00a512 billion; camera {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 50,000 individuals and \u00a518 billion; fashion {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 40,000 individuals and \u00a513 billion; and railway {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 20,000 individuals and \u00a54 billion. Healthcare {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with 4,200 individuals primarily in the Pasco county region and 2 billion yen.<ref name=\"nri2005\" /> These values were partially released with a much higher estimation in 2004, but this definition focused on the consumerism and not the \"unique psychological characteristics\" of {{lang|ja|otaku}} used in the 2005 study.<ref name=\"nri2004\" /><ref name=\"nri2005\" />\n\nNRI's 2005 study also put forth five archetypes of {{lang|ja|otaku}}. The first is the family-oriented {{lang|ja|otaku}}, who has broad interests and is more mature than other {{lang|ja|otaku}}; their object of interest is secretive and they are \"closet {{lang|ja|otaku}}\". The second is the serious \"leaving my own mark on the world\" {{lang|ja|otaku}}, with interests in mechanical or business personality fields. The third type is the \"media-sensitive multiple interest\" {{lang|ja|otaku}}, whose diverse interests are shared with others. The fourth type is the \"outgoing and assertive {{lang|ja|otaku}}\", who gain recognition by promoting their hobby. The last is the \"fan magazine-obsessed {{lang|ja|otaku}}\", which is predominately female with a small group of males being the \"[[Moe (slang)|moe]] type\"; the secret hobby is focused on the production or interest in fan works.<ref name=\"nri2005\" /> The Hamagin Research Institute found that moe-related content was worth \u00a588.8 billion ($807 million) in 2005, and one analyst estimated the market could be as much as \u00a52 trillion ($18 billion).<ref name=\"money\"/> Japan-based ''Tokyo Otaku Mode'', a place for news relating to {{lang|ja|otaku}}, has been liked on Facebook almost 10 million times.<ref name=\"Tokyo Otaku Mode has 10 million Facebook fans but now what\"/>\n\nOther classifications of {{lang|ja|otaku}} interests include vocaloid, cosplay, figures and professional wrestling as categorized by the Yano Research Institute. Yano Research reports and tracks market growth and trends in sectors heavily influenced by {{lang|ja|otaku}} consumerism. In 2012, it noted around 30% of growth in [[dating sim]] and online gaming {{lang|ja|otaku}}, while [[vocaloid]], [[cosplay]], idols and [[Maid caf\u00e9|maid services]] grew by 10%, confirming its 2011 predictions.<ref name=\"Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2012\"/><ref name=\"Otaku Market in Japan: Key Research Findings 2011\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan|Speculative fiction|Video games}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD LINKS HERE THAT ARE BROAD IN SCOPE, WORDS SUCH AS \"FAN\" and \"GEEK\" ARE ALREADY LINKED IN THE ARTICLE.-->\n* [[Anorak (slang)]]\n* ''[[Daicon III and IV Opening Animations]]''\n* [[Geek]]\n* ''[[Genshiken]]''\n* [[Japanophile]]\n* ''[[Otaku no Video]]''\n* [[Hikikomori]]\n* [[Nijikon]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Akihabara\">{{cite web | url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html | title=Akihabara | publisher=japanguide.com | date=July 24, 2013 | accessdate=August 19, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427005552/http://japan-guide.com/e/e3003.html | archive-date=April 27, 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Behold.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

The main parade, which is also partly funded by the city's municipality, was one of the largest ever to take place in Israel, with approximately 200,000 participants. The first [[Tel Aviv Pride|Pride parade in Tel Aviv]] took place in 1993.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of [[Jerusalem]] took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christians|Christian]] communities had arrived to a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the paraders.\n\nAnother parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]]. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israel-Hezbollah war]]. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, and caused a wave of protests by [[Haredi]] Jews around central Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=114609 |title=9 Protesters Detained at Anti-Gay Pride Demonstration |publisher=[[Arutz 7]] |date=November 1, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[Israeli Police|Israel National Police]] had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the [[Jerusalem Open House]] organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Protective Edge]] Operation.\n\n====Japan====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n''See also [[:ja:\u30b2\u30a4\u30fb\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9#\u65e5\u672c|Pride Parade in Japan]]''\n\nThe first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28th, 1994 in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007).

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned. A third Pride parade took place successfully in 2010, with close to 800 participants and an outdoor concert event.\n\n====Croatia====\n{{see also|LGBT rights in Croatia#LGBT prides and other marches}}\nFirst pride parade in Croatia was held on 29 June 2002 in [[Zagreb Pride|Zagreb]] and has been held annually ever since.

In its current format, it has been held every year since 1996, where Copenhagen hosted EuroPride. Before 1994 the national LGBT association organised demonstration-like freedom marches. Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest.

The Festival involves the Pride Parade, the route of which is from [[O'Connell Street]] to [[Merrion Square]]. However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to [[Luas Cross City]] works.\nThe parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]].

As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 \u2013 From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March \u2013 Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n[[File:Chicago Pride Parade 1985 030.jpg|thumb|right|Pride march in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] in 1985]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File: Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned.

The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre.

The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\">{{cite book |language=Italian |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54\u201359}}\n\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|122\u2013124}}\n\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n====Latvia====\n{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalv\u012btis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\n\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[V\u0113rmane Garden]], protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]]. [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazilian]] parades are those from [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] and [[Manaus]].\n\n==== Guyana ====\nGuyana held its first pride parade in June 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://demerarawaves.com/2018/06/02/virtually-incident-free-gay-pride-parade-held-in-guyana-to-demand-election-promises/|title=Virtually incident-free gay pride parade held in Guyana to demand election promises|last=Chabrol|first=Denis|date=2018-06-03|website=Demerara Waves|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> It was the first in the Anglo-phone Caribbean and was successfully staged in spite of religious opposition.\n\n==Opposition==\n\n<nowiki/><nowiki/>{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:SF Pride Drag Queens.jpg|thumb|A festive float with costumed dancers at [[San Francisco Pride]] 2005]]\nThere is opposition to pride events both within LGBT and mainstream populations.\n\nCritics, such as [[Gay Shame]], charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and [[sexual fetish|fetish-related]] interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the \"gay community\" to ridicule.

This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article, where the source is given in a footnote. Cf. also Marsh, D, ed., (2003), ''Invectives'', Harvard University Press, p. 457.</ref> [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, including Petrarch himself,<ref name=mommsen/> had long used traditional [[metaphor]]s of '[[light versus darkness]]' to describe '[[Good and evil|good versus evil]]'. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.<ref name=mommsen/>\n\nFrom his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.<ref name=mommsen/> He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through the progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.\n\nPetrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: \"My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance.\"<ref>[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.</ref> In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age,' which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.<ref name=\"Albrow\">\nAlbrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.\n</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Popes ruling as kings, worship of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.<ref>F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.</ref>\n\n===Baronius=== \nIn response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.<ref>[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. \"Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries.\"</ref> The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.</ref> The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number including the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a specific recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age,' in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers,\" between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages', which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry.\" <ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them, the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith,\" was, therefore, the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World,\" in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them, the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Denis Diderot]],\n[[Voltaire]], [[Marquis De Sade]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion. At the same time [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages.\" <ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age,\" was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages,' used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century, it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith.\" This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice, K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was mainly the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\n19th-century historians widely used the term. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of \"the lively centuries which we call dark.\" <!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--><ref>[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.</ref> More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes \"the dark ages\" as \"a popular if ignorant manner of speaking.\" <ref>Dunphy, Graeme (2007). \"Literary Transitions, 1300\u20131500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern\" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: \"Early Modern German Literature.\"  The chapter opens: \"A popular if an uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as \"the dark ages.\" If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Bl\u00fctezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity.\"</ref>\n\nMost modern historians do not use the term \"dark ages,\" preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].

Further south and east, the same was true in the former Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term neutrally: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.<ref name=mommsen/>\n\nFrom his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.<ref name=mommsen/> He spent much of his time traveling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through the progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.\n\nPetrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: \"My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever.

This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.</ref> In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age,' which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.<ref name=\"Albrow\">\nAlbrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.\n</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\nDuring the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as Popes ruling as kings, worship of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.<ref>F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.</ref>\n\n===Baronius=== \nIn response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.<ref>[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. \"Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries.\"</ref> The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as \"far surpassing anything before\"<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}</ref> and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as \"the greatest history of the Church ever written\".<ref>[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.</ref> The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term \"dark age\" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888<ref>Baronius's actual starting-point for the \"dark age\" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM (\"Saeculum Obscurum\")] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019080028/http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM |date=2009-10-19 }}, have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the \"lack of writers\" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.</ref> and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; clear:right;\"\n|+ Volumes of ''Patrologia Latina'' per century<ref>[[Philip Schaff|Schaff, Philip]] (1882).

The \"lack of writers\" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number including the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.\n\n[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500\u20131500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.<ref>Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: \"Charting the \"Rise of the West\": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries,\" ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&nbsp;409\u2013445 (416, table 1)</ref> The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]\n\nThere is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a specific recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age,' in Baronius's sense of a \"lack of writers,\" between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of \"lack of writers\" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].\n\nBaronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.\n\nThe first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages', which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the \"Epistle Dedicatory\" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: \"The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages.\"<ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.</ref> He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of \"St George's fighting with the dragon\" as \"a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry.\" <ref>[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.</ref> Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.\n\n===Enlightenment===\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them, the Middle Ages, or \"Age of Faith,\" was, therefore, the opposite of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]].<ref>[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). \"Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World,\" in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. \"Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them, the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform.\"</ref> [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Denis Diderot]],\n[[Voltaire]], [[Marquis De Sade]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion. At the same time [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the \"rubbish of the Dark Ages.\" <ref>[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.</ref> Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a \"new age,\" was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.\n\nConsequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.\n\nNevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages,' used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word \"medieval\" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century, it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized \"Dark Ages\" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.<ref name=\"OED\"/> Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.\n\n===Romanticism===\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].<ref>Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.</ref> The word \"[[Goths|Gothic]]\" had been a term of opprobrium akin to \"[[Vandal]]\" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English \"Goths\" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an \"Age of Faith.\" This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>Chandler, Alice, K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.</ref> The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.\n\nJust as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was mainly the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.\n\n==Modern academic use==\n{{See also|Medieval studies}}\n19th-century historians widely used the term. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.<ref>Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.</ref> However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,<ref name=dmas/> or at least its more pejorative use.

However, at this time, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nHowever, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.<ref name=dmas/> Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term neutrally: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so.

a [[non-metropolitan district]] of [[Cumbria]], England, with [[Borough status in England and Wales|borough status]]. Its council is based in [[Workington]] and the borough has a population of 93,492 according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], increasing to 96,422 at the 2011 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275003&c=Allerdale&d=13&e=62&g=6411164&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1434462238094&enc=1|title=Local Authority population 2011|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Borough of Allerdale was formed under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the [[municipal borough]] of [[Workington]], the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] of [[Maryport]], [[Cockermouth]] and [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]]; and the [[rural district]]s of [[Cockermouth Rural District|Cockermouth]] and [[Wigton Rural District|Wigton]], all of which were within the [[administrative counties of England|administrative county]] of [[Cumberland]]. In 1995 Allerdale was granted [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]].\n\nThe name derives from the ancient region of Allerdale, represented latterly by the two [[ward (politics)|wards]] of [[Cumberland, England|Cumberland]], called Allerdale above Derwent and Allerdale below Derwent, the present borough corresponding largely to the latter with parts of the former. Much of the area during the medieval period was a [[Royal Forest]] subject to forest law.<ref>{{cite book|publisher = Alan Sutton |isbn = 0-86299-781-X |location = Wolfeboro Falls, NH |title = The royal forests of England |author = Raymond Grant |date = 1991 |id = 086299781X|ol = 1878197M }} See table, p221</ref>\n\n==Settlements==\nWorkington is the largest settlement in the borough, and is the seat of the borough council.

To be [[called to the Bar]] and practise as a barrister in [[England and Wales]], a person must belong to one of these Inns. It is located in the wider [[Temple (London)|Temple]] area of the capital, near the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], and within the [[City of London]].\n\nThe Inn is a [[professional body]] that provides legal training, selection, and regulation for members. It is ruled by a governing council called \"Parliament\", made up of the Masters of the Bench (or \"[[Bencher]]s\"), and led by the [[Treasurer#In the Inns of Court|Treasurer]], who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Temple takes its name from the [[Knights Templar]], who originally (until their abolition in 1312) leased the land to the Temple's inhabitants (Templars). The Inner Temple was a distinct society from at least 1388, although as with all the Inns of Court its precise date of founding is not known. After a disrupted early period (during which the Temple was almost entirely destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]]) it flourished, becoming the second-largest Inn during the [[Elizabethan period]] (after [[Gray's Inn]]).\n\nThe Inner Temple expanded during the reigns of [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with 1,700 students admitted between 1600 and 1640. The [[First English Civil War]]'s outbreak led to a complete suspension of legal education,<ref name=\"Fletcher 1901 p. xliv\">Fletcher (1901) p. xliv</ref> with the Inns close to being shut down for almost four years. Following the [[English Restoration]] the Inner Templars welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to London personally with a lavish banquet.\n\nAfter a period of slow decline in the 18th century, the following 100 years saw a restoration of the Temple's fortunes, with buildings constructed or restored, such as the Hall and the Library. Much of this work was destroyed during [[The Blitz]], when the Hall, Temple, [[Temple Church]], and many sets of [[Chambers (law)|chambers]] were devastated. Rebuilding was completed in 1959, and today the Temple is a flourishing and active Inn of Court, with over 8,000 members.\n\n==Role==\n{{See also|Barristers in England and Wales|Inns of Court}}\nThe Inner Temple is one of the four [[Inns of Court]],<ref name=\"ac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=14 |title=Archive Catalogue |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> along with [[Gray's Inn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.graysinn.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=1&Itemid=659 |title=Gray's Inn |publisher=[[Gray's Inn]] |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> [[Lincoln's Inn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/inns.asp |title=Lincoln's Inn History |publisher=[[Lincoln's Inn]] |accessdate=24 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025170923/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/inns.asp |archivedate=25 October 2009}}</ref> and the [[Middle Temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middletemple.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=[[Middle Temple]] |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> The Inns are responsible for training, regulating, and selecting barristers within [[England and Wales]], and are the only bodies allowed to [[call to the Bar|call a barrister to the Bar]] and allow him or her to practice.<ref name=\"it55\">{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/ |title=Inner Temple |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> \n\nThe Temple is an independent,<ref name=\"ac\"/> unincorporated organisation,<ref name=\"it55\"/> and works as a [[Trust law|trust]].

The old Temple eventually became the London palace of the Bishop of Lincoln. After the Reformation it became the home of the [[Earl of Southampton]], and the location is now named Southampton Buildings. The first group of lawyers came to live here during the 13th century, although as legal advisers to the Knights rather than as a society. The Knights fell out of favour, and the order was dissolved in 1312, with the land seized by the king and granted to the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. The Hospitallers probably did not live on the property, but rather used it as a source of revenue through rent.<ref name=hist1>{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/temple-history/inner-temple-history-introduction-part-1.htm |title=Inner Temple History \u2013 Introduction \u2013 Part I |last=Baker |first=John |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=8 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened that ended this form of legal education; first, a [[papal bull]] of 1207 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the [[common law]], rather than [[canon law]],<ref>Douthwaite (1886) p.2</ref> and second, a decree by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London.<ref>Ringrose (1909) p.2</ref><ref name=watt1>Watt (1928) p.133</ref> As a result, the Church ceased to have a role in legal education in London. The secular, common law lawyers migrated to the hamlet of [[Holborn]], as it was easy to get to the law courts at [[Westminster Hall]] and was just outside the City.<ref name=watt1/>\n\nTwo groups occupied the Hospitaller land, and became known as the \"inner inn\" (occupying the consecrated buildings near the centre of the Temple) and the \"middle inn\" (occupying the unconsecrated buildings between the \"inner inn\" and the [[Outer Temple]]). These became the Inner Temple and the [[Middle Temple]], and were distinct societies by 1388, when they are mentioned in a [[Year Books|year book]].<ref name=hist1/> The Hospitallers leased the land to the Inner Temple for \u00a310 a year, with students coming from [[Thavie's Inn]] to study there.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.214</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Jean Froissart, Chroniques, 154v, 12148 btv1b8438605hf336, crop.jpg|thumb|An image from the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, during which the Inner Temple was largely destroyed]]\nThere are few records of the Inner Temple from the 14th and 15th centuries\u2014indeed, from all the societies, although Lincoln's Inn's records stretch back to 1422. The Temple was sacked by [[Wat Tyler]] and his rebels during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, with buildings pulled down and records destroyed.<ref>Bellot, p. 118</ref> [[John Stow]] wrote that, after breaking into [[Fleet Prison]], the rebels:\n\n<blockquote>went to the Temple to destroy it, and plucked down the houses, tooke off the tyles of the other buildings left; went to the churche, tooke out all the bookes and remembrances that were m the hatches of the prentices of the law, carried them into the high street, and there burnt them. This house they spoyled for wrathe they bare to the prior of St. John's, unto whom it belonged, and, after a number of them had sacked this Temple, what with labour and what with wine being overcome, they lay down under the walls and housing,, and were slain like swyne, one of them killing another for old grudge and hatred, and others also made quick dispatch of them. A number of them that burnt the Temple went from thence to the Savoy, destroying in their way all the houses that belonged to the Hospital of St. John.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.217</ref></blockquote>\n[[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] thinks that the inhabitants took the opportunity to rebuild much of the Temple, and that this was when the Temple's Hall was built, since it contained 14th century roofing that would not have been available to the Knights Templar.<ref name=hist1/> The Inns of Court were similarly attacked in [[Jack Cade]]'s rebellion, although there are no specific records showing damage to the Inner Temple.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.218</ref>\n\nWith the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, the Hospitallers' properties were confiscated by [[Henry VIII of England|the king]], who leased them to the Inner and Middle Temples until 1573. Following a Scotsman's request to purchase the land, the Inner and Middle Temples appealed to [[James VI and I|James I]], who granted the land to a group of noted lawyers and [[Bencher]]s, including Henry Montague and Sir [[Julius Caesar (judge)|Julius Caesar]], and to \"their heirs and assignees for ever\" on the condition that the Inner and Middle Temples each paid him \u00a310 a year.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.219</ref>\n\n===Elizabethan age===\nThe Elizabethan age saw a large amount of rebuilding and beautification within the Temple, and with over 100 sets of chambers it was the second largest Inn (after [[Gray's Inn]]), with 155 residential students reported in 1574.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nIn winter 1561, the Inner Temple was the scene of an extraordinary set of [[revels]] that celebrated the raising of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] as the Temple's \"Christmas Prince\", a role he was granted in gratitude for his intervention in a dispute with the [[Middle Temple]] over [[Lyon's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Chancery]] that had historically been tied to the Inner Temple. Dudley's influence swayed [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] into asking [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]] to rule in favour of the Inner Temple, and in gratitude the Parliament and Governors swore never to take a case against Dudley and to offer him their legal services whenever required.<ref name=\"Axton 1970 p.365\">Axton (1970) p.365</ref>\n\nThis pledge was always honoured, and in 1576 the Inner Temple Parliament referred to Dudley as the \"chief governor of this House\".<ref name=\"Axton 1970 p.365\"/> The play was partially documented by [[Gerard Legh]] in his ''Accedens of Armory'', a book of heraldry woodcuts, which described Dudley's role as Prince Pallaphilos, the lieutenant of [[Athena]] and Patron of the Order of the Pegasus.<ref>Axton (1970) p.368</ref>\n\n===Seventeenth century===\n[[File:Charles II of England.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whom the Inner Templars welcomed back to London after the [[English Restoration]]]]\nThe Inner Temple continued to expand during the reigns of [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with 1,700 students admitted to the Inn between 1600 and 1640.<ref name=hist1/> The outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]] led to a complete suspension of legal education,<ref name=\"Fletcher 1901 p. xliv\"/> with the Inns almost shut down for nearly four years; the Inns \"suffered a mortal collapse\".<ref name=hist1/> Nothing was done to adapt the old system of legal education, which was declining anyway, to the new climate of internal war.<ref>Holdsworth (1921) p. 207</ref> After the end of the Civil War, the old system was not restored; [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Readers]] refused to read and both barristers and Benchers refused to follow the internal regulations.<ref>Holdsworth (1921) p. 208</ref> The last reading at Inner Temple was made in 1678.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nFollowing the [[English Restoration]], the Inner Temple welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to London with a lavish banquet on 15 August 1661. The banquet was hosted by Sir [[Heneage Finch (speaker)|Heneage Finch]], the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] and was attended by the King, four Dukes including the [[James II of England|Duke of York]], fourteen Earls of England, Scotland and Ireland, 6 Lords and the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]].<ref>Pearce (1848) p.234</ref> The group proceeded from [[Whitehall]] on the King's barge, landed at the Temple and walked through the Temple Garden surrounded by all the Benchers, barristers and servants of the Temple, fifty of whom brought a lavish feast for the revellers. At the start of the next legal term, two Dukes including the Duke of York, two Earls and two Lords were admitted as members, and the Duke of York was [[called to the Bar]] and made an honorary Bencher.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.235</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of the [[House of Stuart]], much was done by the [[Court of Star Chamber]] to enforce religious edicts against Catholicism within the Inner Temple. An order was sent directly to the Benchers proclaiming that no \"pson eyther convented or suspected for papistrye shulde be called eyther to the benche or to the barre\", and at the same time Benchers were selected specifically because of their Protestant beliefs, with popular and successful Catholics held back.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.232</ref>\n\nThis period also features an example of the independent standing of the Temple; in 1668 the Lord Mayor of London attempted to enter the Temple with his sword, something that was his right in the City but not permitted within the Temple. The students took his sword and forced him to spend the night in a set of chambers; when he escaped and tried to return, they called the [[trainband]]s.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.236</ref> The Mayor complained to the King, who heard the case on 7 April 1669 and decided to allow it to be determined by law rather than by his royal privilege; the lawyers returned to the principle that the Temple could set its own internal rules on the right to carry swords.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.237</ref>\n\nMuch of the Inn was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, and extensive damage was done in other fires in 1677 and 1678.<ref>Bellot (1902), pp. 59, 100, 298-299, 302, 324</ref> One of these fires destroyed Caeser's Buildings, on Middle Temple Lane where Lamb Buildings now stand, and the site was purchased by Middle Temple from Inner Temple, which needed the proceeds to repair or rebuild other buildings.<ref>Bellot (1902), p. 304</ref>\n\n===Eighteenth century to the present===\nThe 18th century was a period of relative stability, with an element of decline.

To be [[called to the Bar]] and practise as a barrister in [[England and Wales]], a person must belong to one of these Inns. It is located in the wider [[Temple (London)|Temple]] area of the capital, near the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], and within the [[City of London]].\n\nThe Inn is a [[professional body]] that provides legal training, selection, and regulation for members. It is ruled by a governing council called \"Parliament\", made up of the Masters of the Bench (or \"[[Bencher]]s\"), and led by the [[Treasurer#In the Inns of Court|Treasurer]], who is elected to serve a one-year term. The Temple takes its name from the [[Knights Templar]], who originally (until their abolition in 1312) leased the land to the Temple's inhabitants (Templars). The Inner Temple was a distinct society from at least 1388, although as with all the Inns of Court its precise date of founding is not known. After a disrupted early period (during which the Temple was almost entirely destroyed in the [[Peasants' Revolt]]) it flourished, becoming the second-largest Inn during the [[Elizabethan period]] (after [[Gray's Inn]]).\n\nThe Inner Temple expanded during the reigns of [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with 1,700 students admitted between 1600 and 1640. The [[First English Civil War]]'s outbreak led to a complete suspension of legal education,<ref name=\"Fletcher 1901 p. xliv\">Fletcher (1901) p. xliv</ref> with the Inns close to being shut down for almost four years. Following the [[English Restoration]] the Inner Templars welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to London personally with a lavish banquet.\n\nAfter a period of slow decline in the 18th century, the following 100 years saw a restoration of the Temple's fortunes, with buildings constructed or restored, such as the Hall and the Library. Much of this work was destroyed during [[The Blitz]], when the Hall, Temple, [[Temple Church]], and many sets of [[Chambers (law)|chambers]] were devastated. Rebuilding was completed in 1959, and today the Temple is a flourishing and active Inn of Court, with over 8,000 members.\n\n==Role==\n{{See also|Barristers in England and Wales|Inns of Court}}\nThe Inner Temple is one of the four [[Inns of Court]],<ref name=\"ac\">{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7&Itemid=14 |title=Archive Catalogue |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> along with [[Gray's Inn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.graysinn.info/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=1&Itemid=659 |title=Gray's Inn |publisher=[[Gray's Inn]] |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> [[Lincoln's Inn]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/inns.asp |title=Lincoln's Inn History |publisher=[[Lincoln's Inn]] |accessdate=24 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025170923/http://www.lincolnsinn.org.uk/inns.asp |archivedate=25 October 2009}}</ref> and the [[Middle Temple]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middletemple.org.uk/ |title=Home |publisher=[[Middle Temple]] |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> The Inns are responsible for training, regulating, and selecting barristers within [[England and Wales]], and are the only bodies allowed to [[call to the Bar|call a barrister to the Bar]] and allow him or her to practice.<ref name=\"it55\">{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemple.org.uk/ |title=Inner Temple |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=24 November 2009}}</ref> \n\nThe Temple is an independent,<ref name=\"ac\"/> unincorporated organisation,<ref name=\"it55\"/> and works as a [[Trust law|trust]].

The old Temple eventually became the London palace of the Bishop of Lincoln. After the Reformation it became the home of the [[Earl of Southampton]], and the location is now named Southampton Buildings. The first group of lawyers came to live here during the 13th century, although as legal advisers to the Knights rather than as a society. The Knights fell out of favour, and the order was dissolved in 1312, with the land seized by the king and granted to the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. The Hospitallers probably did not live on the property, but rather used it as a source of revenue through rent.<ref name=hist1>{{cite web |url=http://www.innertemplelibrary.org.uk/temple-history/inner-temple-history-introduction-part-1.htm |title=Inner Temple History \u2013 Introduction \u2013 Part I |last=Baker |first=John |publisher=Inner Temple |accessdate=8 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 12th and 13th centuries the law was taught in the [[City of London]], primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened that ended this form of legal education; first, a [[papal bull]] of 1207 that prohibited the clergy from teaching the [[common law]], rather than [[canon law]],<ref>Douthwaite (1886) p.2</ref> and second, a decree by [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] on 2 December 1234 that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London.<ref>Ringrose (1909) p.2</ref><ref name=watt1>Watt (1928) p.133</ref> As a result, the Church ceased to have a role in legal education in London. The secular, common law lawyers migrated to the hamlet of [[Holborn]], as it was easy to get to the law courts at [[Westminster Hall]] and was just outside the City.<ref name=watt1/>\n\nTwo groups occupied the Hospitaller land, and became known as the \"inner inn\" (occupying the consecrated buildings near the centre of the Temple) and the \"middle inn\" (occupying the unconsecrated buildings between the \"inner inn\" and the [[Outer Temple]]). These became the Inner Temple and the [[Middle Temple]], and were distinct societies by 1388, when they are mentioned in a [[Year Books|year book]].<ref name=hist1/> The Hospitallers leased the land to the Inner Temple for \u00a310 a year, with students coming from [[Thavie's Inn]] to study there.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.214</ref>\n\n===Early years===\n[[File:Jean Froissart, Chroniques, 154v, 12148 btv1b8438605hf336, crop.jpg|thumb|An image from the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, during which the Inner Temple was largely destroyed]]\nThere are few records of the Inner Temple from the 14th and 15th centuries\u2014indeed, from all the societies, although Lincoln's Inn's records stretch back to 1422. The Temple was sacked by [[Wat Tyler]] and his rebels during the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, with buildings pulled down and records destroyed. [[John Stow]] wrote that, after breaking into [[Fleet Prison]], the rebels:\n\n<blockquote>went to the Temple to destroy it, and plucked down the houses, tooke off the tyles of the other buildings left; went to the churche, tooke out all the bookes and remembrances that were m the hatches of the prentices of the law, carried them into the high street, and there burnt them. This house they spoyled for wrathe they bare to the prior of St. John's, unto whom it belonged, and, after a number of them had sacked this Temple, what with labour and what with wine being overcome, they lay down under the walls and housing,, and were slain like swyne, one of them killing another for old grudge and hatred, and others also made quick dispatch of them. A number of them that burnt the Temple went from thence to the Savoy, destroying in their way all the houses that belonged to the Hospital of St. John.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.217</ref></blockquote>\n[[John Baker (legal historian)|John Baker]] thinks that the inhabitants took the opportunity to rebuild much of the Temple, and that this was when the Temple's Hall was built, since it contained 14th century roofing that would not have been available to the Knights Templar.<ref name=hist1/> The Inns of Court were similarly attacked in [[Jack Cade]]'s rebellion, although there are no specific records showing damage to the Inner Temple.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.218</ref>\n\nWith the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1539, the Hospitallers' properties were confiscated by [[Henry VIII of England|the king]], who leased them to the Inner and Middle Temples until 1573. Following a Scotsman's request to purchase the land, the Inner and Middle Temples appealed to [[James VI and I|James I]], who granted the land to a group of noted lawyers and [[Bencher]]s, including Henry Montague and Sir [[Julius Caesar (judge)|Julius Caesar]], and to \"their heirs and assignees for ever\" on the condition that the Inner and Middle Temples each paid him \u00a310 a year.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.219</ref>\n\n===Elizabethan age===\nThe Elizabethan age saw a large amount of rebuilding and beautification within the Temple, and with over 100 sets of chambers it was the second largest Inn (after [[Gray's Inn]]), with 155 residential students reported in 1574.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nIn winter 1561, the Inner Temple was the scene of an extraordinary set of [[revels]] that celebrated the raising of [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] as the Temple's \"Christmas Prince\", a role he was granted in gratitude for his intervention in a dispute with the [[Middle Temple]] over [[Lyon's Inn]], one of the [[Inns of Chancery]] that had historically been tied to the Inner Temple. Dudley's influence swayed [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] into asking [[Nicholas Bacon (courtier)|Nicholas Bacon]] to rule in favour of the Inner Temple, and in gratitude the Parliament and Governors swore never to take a case against Dudley and to offer him their legal services whenever required.<ref name=\"Axton 1970 p.365\">Axton (1970) p.365</ref>\n\nThis pledge was always honoured, and in 1576 the Inner Temple Parliament referred to Dudley as the \"chief governor of this House\".<ref name=\"Axton 1970 p.365\"/> The play was partially documented by [[Gerard Legh]] in his ''Accedens of Armory'', a book of heraldry woodcuts, which described Dudley's role as Prince Pallaphilos, the lieutenant of [[Athena]] and Patron of the Order of the Pegasus.<ref>Axton (1970) p.368</ref>\n\n===Seventeenth century===\n[[File:Charles II of England.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whom the Inner Templars welcomed back to London after the [[English Restoration]]]]\nThe Inner Temple continued to expand during the reigns of [[James VI and I|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], with 1,700 students admitted to the Inn between 1600 and 1640.<ref name=hist1/> The outbreak of the [[First English Civil War]] led to a complete suspension of legal education,<ref name=\"Fletcher 1901 p. xliv\"/> with the Inns almost shut down for nearly four years; the Inns \"suffered a mortal collapse\".<ref name=hist1/> Nothing was done to adapt the old system of legal education, which was declining anyway, to the new climate of internal war.<ref>Holdsworth (1921) p. 207</ref> After the end of the Civil War, the old system was not restored; [[Reader (Inns of Court)|Readers]] refused to read and both barristers and Benchers refused to follow the internal regulations.<ref>Holdsworth (1921) p. 208</ref> The last reading at Inner Temple was made in 1678.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nFollowing the [[English Restoration]], the Inner Temple welcomed [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] back to London with a lavish banquet on 15 August 1661.

At the start of the next legal term, two Dukes including the Duke of York, two Earls and two Lords were admitted as members, and the Duke of York was [[called to the Bar]] and made an honorary Bencher.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.235</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of the [[House of Stuart]], much was done by the [[Court of Star Chamber]] to enforce religious edicts against Catholicism within the Inner Temple. An order was sent directly to the Benchers proclaiming that no \"pson eyther convented or suspected for papistrye shulde be called eyther to the benche or to the barre\", and at the same time Benchers were selected specifically because of their Protestant beliefs, with popular and successful Catholics held back.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.232</ref>\n\nThis period also features an example of the independent standing of the Temple; in 1668 the Lord Mayor of London attempted to enter the Temple with his sword, something that was his right in the City but not permitted within the Temple. The students took his sword and forced him to spend the night in a set of chambers; when he escaped and tried to return, they called the [[trainband]]s.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.236</ref> The Mayor complained to the King, who heard the case on 7 April 1669 and decided to allow it to be determined by law rather than by his royal privilege; the lawyers returned to the principle that the Temple could set its own internal rules on the right to carry swords.<ref>Pearce (1848) p.237</ref>\n\nMuch of the Inn was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, and extensive damage was done in other fires in 1677 and 1678.<ref>Bellot (1902), pp. 59, 100, 298-299, 302, 324</ref> One of these fires destroyed Caeser's Buildings, on Middle Temple Lane where Lamb Buildings now stand, and the site was purchased by Middle Temple from Inner Temple, which needed the proceeds to repair or rebuild other buildings.<ref>Bellot (1902), p. 304</ref>\n\n===Eighteenth century to the present===\nThe 18th century was a period of relative stability, with an element of decline.

Sandhya's sister Surekha ([[Surekha Vani]]) marries Rambabu ([[Krishna Bhagavaan]]), who harasses her only to exploit Sandhya. Ravi narrates an interesting story to the producer ([[Sayaji Shinde]]), but the latter is not ready to take the risk with a debutant director like Ravi.\n\nMeanwhile, a rich goon Yadu ([[Supreeth]]), who usurps prime lands, casts his eyes on Sandhya, and Rambabu tries to make use of this in his favor. At this juncture, Ravi narrates the story to hero Mallik ([[Subbaraju]]) who also expresses his doubts regarding its feasibility. When Ravi pleads for a chance, he agrees for a trial shoot and they seek the help of Sandhya and other friends. Popular director [[V. V. Vinayak]] asks Ravi for a heroine. Having seen Sandhya's performance in the trial shoot, he books her.\n\nWhen Sandhya becomes a heroine, Rambabu ignores Yadu. Mallik, impressed with the trial shoot, convinces the producer. The producer had suffered much loss due to Vishwanath's film. The film shooting begins with Mallik as hero and Sandhya as heroine. At this time, an item dancer Mumaith ([[Mumaith Khan]]), who had an affair with Mallik, attempts suicide and is raped. This and the paucity of funds puts the project in trouble. Yadu comes forward to finance the project. Once the shooting is over, Ravi finds his name missing in the titles.

S. Narayana]]) as co-director for director Idly Viswanath ([[Brahmanandam]]) in the Telugu film industry. During the shooting, Ravi meets Sandhya (Siya Gautham), a group dancer. Sandhya's sister Surekha ([[Surekha Vani]]) gets married to Rambabu ([[Krishna Bhagavaan]]), who harasses her only to exploit Sandhya. Ravi narrates an interesting story to the producer ([[Sayaji Shinde]]), but the latter is not ready to take the risk with a debutant director like Ravi.\n\nMeanwhile, a rich goon Yadu ([[Supreeth]]), who usurps prime lands, casts his eyes on Sandhya, and Rambabu tries to make use of this in his favor. At this juncture, Ravi narrates the story to hero Mallik ([[Subbaraju]]) who also expresses his doubts regarding its feasibility. When Ravi pleads for a chance, he agrees for a trial shoot and they seek the help of Sandhya and other friends. Popular director [[V. V. Vinayak]] asks Ravi for a heroine. Having seen Sandhya's performance in the trial shoot, he books her.\n\nWhen Sandhya becomes a heroine, Rambabu ignores Yadu. Mallik, impressed with the trial shoot, convinces the producer. The producer had suffered much loss due to Vishwanath's film. The film shooting begins with Mallik as hero and Sandhya as heroine. At this time, an item dancer Mumaith ([[Mumaith Khan]]), who had an affair with Mallik, attempts suicide and is raped. This and the paucity of funds puts the project in trouble. Yadu comes forward to finance the project. Once the shooting is over, Ravi finds his name missing in the titles. Eventually, he teaches Yadu a lesson and replaces the name.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Ravi Teja]] as Ravikumar\n*Siya Gautham as Sandhya\n*[[Subbaraju]] as Mallik\n*[[Sayaji Shinde]] as Film Producer\n*[[Supreeth|Supreet Reddy]] as Yadhu\n*[[Brahmanandam]] as Idly Vishwanath\n*[[Rama Prabha]] as Ravi's mother\n*[[Krishna Bhagawan]] as Rambabu\n*[[Venu Madhav (actor)|Venu Madhav]] as Ravi's assistant\n*[[Mumaith Khan]] as Mumaith\n*[[Kovai Sarala]] as Urmila\n*[[Sairam Shankar]] as Sai\n*[[Abhinaya (actress)|Abhinaya]] as Film Producer's daughter\n*[[Raja Ravindra]]\n*[[Satyam Rajesh]]\n*[[Harish Shankar]], [[V.
