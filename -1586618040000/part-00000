MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

A joint [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] was conducted by [[Meiji University]] and Musashino Museum in July of the same year. This was the second survey on the Paleolithic Age in Japan after a study of the [[Iwajuku]] archaeological site in [[Gunma Prefecture]]. It became clear that Paleolithic culture, which is older than that from the [[J\u014dmon period]], had spread universally in Japan. In addition, the knife-shaped stoneware excavated in this survey had a very distinctive form and was named a {{nihongo|Moro [[Blade (archaeology)|knife]]|\u8302\u5442\u578b\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u5f62\u77f3\u5668| Moro-gata naifu-gata sekki}}.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo. The scroll crest first appeared on the teams shorts for the start of the 1978\u201379 season.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Badges\">{{cite web|url=http://www.danburymint.co.uk/index.php?act=product&product_id=4250&cat_id=&mediacode=&kiks_code=|title=The Badges of Rangers Football Club|publisher=Danbury Mint|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=The earliest badge featured the celebrated RFC scroll crest believed to have been used since 1872.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation. '1872\u20132012' appeared above the scroll crest with the words '140 years' featuring below.<ref name=\"Rangers Crest Gersnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.therangersarchive.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=261&Itemid=326|title=The Rangers Crest|publisher=Gersnet Online|accessdate=21 January 2013|quote=From 1990 to 1994 'Rangers Football Club' and the 'Ready' motto were placed above and below the Crest respectively.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

Today the original scroll crest appears on the club's strips whereas the [[lion (heraldry)|lion rampant]] club crest is used by the media, on club merchandise and on official club documents. Both crests have undergone minor variations since their introduction. It is believed that the scroll crest, representing the letters ''RFC'' overlapping, has been used since the club's formation in 1872, although the oldest remaining piece of memorabilia containing this crest is from the 1881\u201382 season. The scroll crest was replaced in 1959 with the lion rampant club crest which featured a lion rampant, an old-style football and the club's motto ''Ready'', which was shortened from ''Aye Ready'' (meaning ''Always Ready'' in [[Scots language|Scots]]), all surrounded by the team name, ''Rangers Football Club''. The lion rampant club crest was modernised in 1968; the lion rampant, team name, club motto and old style football all remained. It was again updated slightly in the early 1990s to the current version. The modern circular crest is regularly used on club merchandise and by the media; it has never featured prominently on the club strip. In 1968 the scroll crest made a return appearing on the chest of the club shirt for the first time while the modernised club crest was still the club's official logo.

The team wore a special crest on 8 December 2012 in a home league match against Stirling Albion, to commemorate the 140th anniversary of their formation.

However, for the majority of the first forty-eight years of Rangers existence the club played in a plain lighter blue home shirt. The only deviation from this was a four-season period from 1879 when the side wore the lighter shade of blue and white in a hooped style. Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. Rangers moved from the lighter shade of blue to royal blue in 1921, and have had a royal blue home shirt every year since. Black socks were first included in 1883 for five seasons before disappearing for eight years but became a more permanent fixture from 1896 onwards. When the red turn-downs were added to the socks in 1904, the strip began to look more like the modern day Rangers home kit. Occasionally the home kit will be altered by the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|title=Rangers|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=17 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624074927/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers.htm|archivedate=24 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. Rangers original change strip, used between 1876 and 1879, was all white featuring blue and white hooped socks and a light blue [[Star (polygon)#Six-pointed stars|six pointed star]] on the chest. White and red have been the most common colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly. In 1994 Rangers introduced a [[third kit]]. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used in the third kits have included combinations of white, red, dark and light blue as well as black.<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|title=Rangers Change Kits|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor|accessdate=24 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913081516/http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/Rangers/Rangers-change-kits.html|archivedate=13 September 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Orange and blue change strips, first seen in 1993\u201394,<ref name=\"Rangers away historical kits\" /> worn once in 2002\u201303 and reintroduced in 2018\u201319, have courted controversy because the colours were seen as referencing the [[Orange Order]].<ref name = \"2018\u201319 kits\">{{cite news|title=Ladbrokes Scottish Premiership 2018 - 2019|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Scottish_Football_League/season/2018-2019/premiership.html|accessdate=12 July 2018|work=Historical Football Kits|publisher=Dave Moor}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"7\"|Selection of Rangers kits through history<ref name=\"Rangers home historical kits\" />\n|-\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_hoops_white|leftarm=0033FF|body=0033FF|rightarm=0033FF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0033FF|alt=The blue shirt, white shorts and blue & white hooped socks.

After her sister's death, she also raised her two sons and a daughter. Faraz (Zain Mirza) and Mohsin ([[Emmad Irfani]]). Mohsin is a very conservative, overly furious and egotistic man and doesn't like the fact that his cousins Aina and Sajal are getting out of the house looking for a job and going to university. Mohsin is married to Nadia (Zainab Jameel) and also has a daughter. Sajal is engaged to her cousin (Faraz) and Mohsin and Faraz's sister, Aliya is married to Nadia's brother, Fahad.\n  \nAina likes a boy named Imran (Asad Zaman Khan) who belongs to a very rich family. They both like each other and want to get married. However, Imran has a cousin named Annie who will do anything to marry him when she clearly knows that he likes Aina. Mohsin knew of Aina's affair and forbade Aina from university, since he was the eldest of all so nobody dare to disagree him. Eventually, Aina convinces her family to meet Imran's family. However, Imran's father wants him to marry Annie so that all the properties and money stays the same between the families. Imran's family manages to convince him that they are going to Aina's house for the proposal when in reality he is getting engaged to Annie. Realising that he has been fooled by his family, Imran tries to confront Aina's family but is sent away.\n\nThings take an interesting turn when Imran's father threatens to divorce his mother if he does agree to marry Annie. Aina and Imran decide to meet at a park and he tells her about the divorce and Aina leaves him. Aina brokenheartedly agreed on engagement with Noman (Arsalan Faisal). But deep inside she couldn't forget Imran and therefore she met Imran again and both of them decided to get marry secretly. Sajal and Faraz happily got married and started living a happy married life. Faraz. being opposite of his brother Mohsin was much mild person with no ego issues convinces Mohsin and Aina's  mother to let Aina continue with her studies. Aina manages to convince her fianc\u00e9 to delay the wedding because she wants to continue her studies when in reality she is also meeting Imran. Annie gets suspicious with Imran when he is always out the house. She then catches Aina and Imran red-handed. Annie told everything to Imran's father who abandoned him and Imran started living at his friend's place. Problems started arising among Imran and Aina when both of them started facing financial issues  imran started thinking that Aina is using him for granted. Later imran got pressurized from his father and he divorced aina. Soon aina found that she is pregnant. Soon Faraz discovered and reacted ao fiercely that Aina's mother had a heart attack and on her death bed she asked Faraz to take care of Aina and Sajal and not to tell about Aina to anyone. Aina's mother died. Her death was quite mysterious which provoked Mohsin and Nadia but Faraz started ignoring his brother and Nadia in order to hide Aina's pregnancy. Sajal after her mother's death turned out so cruel and venom-spewing sister to Aina. As Aina didn't want an abortion and therefore Faraz decided to end Aina's engagement with Noman and left for Islamabad along with his wife and Aina. This filled Mohsin with great rage and he abandoned Faraz, who decided that to deliver Aina's baby and pretend him as his and Sajal's. Unfortunately Sajal found her pregnant. Sajal blamed all the situation to Aina and Aina called Imran's mother to adopt his upcoming child as she can't keep him. Sajal had a miscarriage and followed barren life while Imran's mother told Imran about his child, who now is married to Annie. Meanwhile, Imran called Aina but a maid attended the call and told Imran that madam had a miscarriage. Imran assumed it for Aina and decided to forget Aina closing her chapter. Soon Aina gave birth to a baby boy whom Sajal quickly adopted and tried to keep Aina away from her son. Mohsin and Nadia were expecting twins now and Faraz decided to meet Mohsin and Nadia and to end this misunderstanding between them. Sajal and Faraz left for Karachi along with Maaz (Aina's son). Mohsin showed rude behaviour to Faraz who returned to Islamabad. Aina decided to overcome her problems and sorrows and to lead a normal life and started a job as a teacher.\n\nTheir lives were going well when suddenly Mohsin called upon Faraz to Karachi due to Nadia's bad health. Faraz decided to stay in Karachi now along with Sajal and Aina staying at Mohsin's place. Nadia died and gave birth to a daughter and a son. This left Mohsin with great sorrow who regret over his cruel and selfish behavior towards his late wife. Aina started taking care of mohsin's daughter but mohsin was the same man with great rage and ego towards everyone especially aina. Noman (aina's ex-fiance) met aina and desired of marrying her, aina avoided noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested mohsin and sajal andboth of them wanted to get rid of aina convinced aina to marry noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to noman after knowing about aina's affair noman rejected aina. This filled mohsin and sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with sajal and maaz but kept this secret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by mohsin and sajal. Faraz's unending care for aina as a younger sister raised sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurted both faraz and aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became highly furious in the rain where she yelled at mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family.\n\nThis made Aina worried as she thought that her son maaz is going so far and how will she live with mohsin. On the other side mohsin became worried as well and requested faraz not to go and asked about aina over this faraz offered mohsin to marry aina for the sake of his children. This shocked mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that faraz would not leave for America. This left mohsin with shock as he wondered about aina's agreement over his proposal but mohsin disagreed over proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, imran and annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally annie met aina in a mall and told her that imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating  she is living a happy life as well without imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told imran sarcastically who fiercely asked annie to leave his home. On other side aina intensively asked mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to marry her. Imran managed to meet aina and asked for apology aina slapped imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past.

After her sister's death, she also raised her two sons and a daughter. Faraz (Zain Mirza) and Mohsin ([[Emmad Irfani]]). Mohsin is a very conservative, overly furious and egotistic man and doesn't like the fact that his cousins Aina and Sajal are getting out of the house looking for a job and going to university. Mohsin is married to Nadia (Zainab Jameel) and also has a daughter. Sajal is engaged to her cousin (Faraz) and Mohsin and Faraz's sister, Aliya is married to Nadia's brother, Fahad.\n  \nAina likes a boy named Imran (Asad Zaman Khan) who belongs to a very rich family. They both like each other and want to get married. However, Imran has a cousin named Annie who will do anything to marry him when she clearly knows that he likes Aina. Mohsin knew of Aina's affair and forbade Aina from university, since he was the eldest of all so nobody dare to disagree him. Eventually, Aina convinces her family to meet Imran's family. However, Imran's dad wants him to get married to Annie so that all the properties and money stays the same between the families. Imran's family manages to convince him that they are going to Aina's house for the proposal when in reality he is getting engaged to Annie. Realising that he has been fooled by his family, Imran tries to confront Aina's family but is sent away.\n\nThings take an interesting turn when Imran's father threatens to divorce his mother if he does agree to marry Annie. Aina and Imran decide to meet at a park and he tells her about the divorce and Aina leaves him. Aina brokenheartedly agreed on engagement with Noman (Arsalan Faisal). But deep inside she couldn't forget Imran and therefore she met Imran again and both of them decided to get marry secretly. Sajal and Faraz happily got married and started living a happy married life. Faraz. being opposite of his brother Mohsin was much mild person with no ego issues convinces Mohsin and Aina's  mother to let Aina continue with her studies. Aina manages to convince her fianc\u00e9 to delay the wedding because she wants to continue her studies when in reality she is also meeting Imran. Annie gets suspicious with Imran when he is always out the house. She then catches Aina and Imran red-handed. Annie told everything to Imran's father who abandoned him and Imran started living at his friend's place. Problems started arising among Imran and Aina when both of them started facing financial issues  imran started thinking that Aina is using him for granted. Later imran got pressurized from his father and he divorced aina. Soon aina found that she is pregnant. Soon Faraz discovered and reacted ao fiercely that Aina's mother had a heart attack and on her death bed she asked Faraz to take care of Aina and Sajal and not to tell about Aina to anyone. Aina's mother died. Her death was quite mysterious which provoked Mohsin and Nadia but Faraz started ignoring his brother and Nadia in order to hide Aina's pregnancy. Sajal after her mother's death turned out so cruel and venom-spewing sister to Aina. As Aina didn't want an abortion and therefore Faraz decided to end Aina's engagement with Noman and left for Islamabad along with his wife and Aina. This filled Mohsin with great rage and he abandoned Faraz, who decided that to deliver Aina's baby and pretend him as his and Sajal's. Unfortunately Sajal found her pregnant. Sajal blamed all the situation to Aina and Aina called Imran's mother to adopt his upcoming child as she can't keep him. Sajal had a miscarriage and followed barren life while Imran's mother told Imran about his child, who now is married to Annie. Meanwhile, Imran called Aina but a maid attended the call and told Imran that madam had a miscarriage. Imran assumed it for Aina and decided to forget Aina closing her chapter. Soon Aina gave birth to a baby boy whom Sajal quickly adopted and tried to keep Aina away from her son. Mohsin and Nadia were expecting twins now and Faraz decided to meet Mohsin and Nadia and to end this misunderstanding between them. Sajal and Faraz left for Karachi along with Maaz (Aina's son). Mohsin showed rude behaviour to Faraz who returned to Islamabad. Aina decided to overcome her problems and sorrows and to lead a normal life and started a job as a teacher.\n\nTheir lives were going well when suddenly Mohsin called upon Faraz to Karachi due to Nadia's bad health. Faraz decided to stay in Karachi now along with Sajal and Aina staying at Mohsin's place. Nadia died and gave birth to a daughter and a son. This left Mohsin with great sorrow who regret over his cruel and selfish behavior towards his late wife. Aina started taking care of mohsin's daughter but mohsin was the same man with great rage and ego towards everyone especially aina. Noman (aina's ex-fiance) met aina and desired of marrying her, aina avoided noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested mohsin and sajal andboth of them wanted to get rid of aina convinced aina to marry noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to noman after knowing about aina's affair noman rejected aina. This filled mohsin and sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with sajal and maaz but kept this secret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by mohsin and sajal. Faraz's unending care for aina as a younger sister raised sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurted both faraz and aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became highly furious in the rain where she yelled at mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family.\n\nThis made Aina worried as she thought that her son maaz is going so far and how will she live with mohsin. On the other side mohsin became worried as well and requested faraz not to go and asked about aina over this faraz offered mohsin to marry aina for the sake of his children. This shocked mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that faraz would not leave for America. This left mohsin with shock as he wondered about aina's agreement over his proposal but mohsin disagreed over proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, imran and annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally annie met aina in a mall and told her that imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating  she is living a happy life as well without imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told imran sarcastically who fiercely asked annie to leave his home. On other side aina intensively asked mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to get married to her.  Imran managed to meet aina and asked for apology aina slapped imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Ayna \"Aani\" \n* [[Emmad Irfani]] as Mohsin  \n* [[Asad Zaman Khan]] as Imran\n* Shazia Naz as Sajal\n* Zain Mirza as Faraz \n* [[Hira Hussain]] as Annie \n* [[Maryam Nafees]] as Tabinda \"Taabi\" \n* [[Hina Altaf]] as Rania\n* Raeed Muhammed as Maaz\n* Zainab Jameel as Nadia (dead)\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Nayyara (dead)\n* [[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]] as Sohail (dead)\n* Umer Naru as Afaaq \n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Zainab\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Aliya\n* Agha Jararuddin as Aashir\n* Fouzia Mushtaq as Zubaida \n* Shahid as Noman  \n* Neema Alam\n* Zainab Fatima ([[child actor]]) as the young Tabinda \"Taabi\"\n* Rashida Tabassum\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Hum TV]]\n* [[2016 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n{{Television in Pakistan |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuch_Na_Kaho_(TV_series)"}

New studios were opened in the town of [[Wagin, Western Australia|Wagin]] in 2003 to provide local programs.\n\nIn 1992, manager of regional stations Tom Murrell, launched a new morning current affairs program focussing on Great Southern issues and presented by Sarah Knight, which was broadcast from 9am to 11am, and complemented the Great Southern breakfast program presented by Bill McCutcheon.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=ABC Radio Program Based on Great Southern|date=15 March 1992|work=The Narrogin Observer|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2014, the station formerly called ABC South Coast and Great Southern was renamed ABC Great Southern, based in newly renovated offices in Albany. Previously, the 558am Great Southern band had been a relay of what was broadcast from Albany.\n\nLocal programs include Great Southern-specific breakfast and mornings programs, hosted by Andrew Collins and John Cecil respectively. ABC Great Southern also carries the Regional Drive program, which is broadcast by all ABC stations in WA outside of Perth.\n\nWhen local programs are not broadcast the station is a relay of [[720 ABC Perth]].\n\n6WA broadcasts on 558&nbsp;kHz and is a 50,000 watt transmitter located at Minding, 15&nbsp;km west of Wagin. Its signal is received in Perth, much of the Wheatbelt, Great Southern and parts of the South West. The service also broadcasts on 630&nbsp;kHz from 6AL, a 5,000 watt transmitter at Albany, which is heard along the South Coast from [[Ravensthorpe, Western Australia|Ravensthorpe]] in the east to near [[Walpole, Western Australia|Walpole]] in the west.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of radio stations in Australia]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite web |title=The History of the ABC in Wagin |url= http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/10/2185200.htm |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2008 |publisher=[[ABC Online]] }}\n\n{{ABC Local Radio}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ABC Great Southern}}\n[[Category:ABC Local Radio|Great Southern]]\n[[Category:Radio stations in Western Australia]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Great_Southern"}

The Wodi Wodi and Wandrawandian, Dharawal sub groups from the [[Illawarra]]-Shoalhaven area accessed the valley year round. Local Dharawal names are still used such as \"Noggarah\", a big gully and \"Parronrah\", suitable camping areas on the river side flats. Kangaroos and other wildlife abounded and the valley was considered a refuge or game reserve, sometimes used as a meeting place for the various family groups to replenish on their journey to the \"Cowpastures\" around the Camden/Appin area, where larger gatherings took place with neighbouring clans such as the Gundungurra from the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], to trade and conduct ceremony. Quite often disputes were also addressed through a formal process.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe arrival of the cedar getters and cattlemen in the 1800s changed the Aboriginal way of life and eventually only two family groups were recorded as living in the valley; at Trimbles Creek, north end of the valley and along the river on the southern side of the main village. By the early 1900s these remaining family groups were displaced from their lands and relocated with their remaining family groups clustered along the Illawarra/Shoalhaven coast, in places such as the (former) government reserves at Coomaditchee, Roseby Park and Wreck Bay.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nRegardless of the physical exorcising of the Aboriginal people from the land, the rich Aboriginal landscape of this valley remains captured in the numerous traditional campsites marked by stone artefact scatters along the \"Parronrah\" and axe grinding grooves at Barrengarry; and also in the special places such as rock art sites in the sandstone overhangs along the \"Noggarah\" that feed into the main river, accompanied by the sharing of stories and song lines describing the important connections people have to country, and most importantly in the continuing culture of the Aboriginal people of the region today.<ref name=nswshr-2024/><ref>Information provided by Rod Wellington</ref>\n\nEuropean settlement of the valley began in the late 1810s, with Richard Brooks sending cattle into the valley from the already settled districts of [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] and [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] in 1817 and then taking up a grant in the valley in 1820. Others moved into the valley from Sutton Forest to occupy land around [[Brogers Creek, New South Wales|Brogers Creek]]. Cedar- getting also commenced in the first half of this century, with Kangaroo Valley known for its red cedar. Kangaroo Valley was surveyed by Hoddle in 1831. Several areas were selected for cattle stations in the 1830s, but the 1841 census showed only seven men inhabiting the valley.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n[[Charles Throsby]] had passed through Kangaroo Valley in 1818 in search of a route from the coast to the settled districts along the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] ([[Hume Highway]]). Throsby's route may have laid the line for the [[Cambewarra, New South Wales|Cambewarra]] Road. The Cambewarra Road remained an important connection between the more closely settled districts to the north-west, with road access to [[Parramatta]] and [[Sydney]], and the south coast. With access from Sydney to [[Wollongong]] still difficult into the early twentieth century, travelling to the south coast via the Cambewarra Road, remained a popular way (and still is today) to reach the south coast.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n[[Henry Osborne (Australian politician)|Henry Osborne]], an Irish settler was a prominent landholder in the valley as well at other locations across the state and in 1837 held over 4000 acres. Charles McCaffrey, one of a group of settlers from Fermanagh, Ireland, brought dairy farming into the [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]]-Shoalhaven region, settling at Barrengarry in 1846. He soon began a dairy and butter production. Once Kangaroo Valley was opened to free settlement, the population grew from 200 in 1861, to 1,400 in 1881 as dairy farmers flocked to the valley. The region developed to become the Colony's major butter producer. However, travelling out of the region to the coast and [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] was still restricted by having to cross a ford over the Kangaroo River.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs the local farming activities reached a peak in the 1870s, it was decided to construct a two span timber truss bridge over the Kangaroo River of the \"Old [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]]\" (Old PWD) design. The call for tenders was advertised in the [[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|Government Gazette]] 21 August 1874, p.&nbsp;2531. The awarding of the contract to build the bridge for A\u00a33,000 to the Braidwood based company, Kelly and Walsh was advertised in the Government Gazette 11 September 1876 p.&nbsp;3608. According to Clark (1998) there were many unforseen difficulties encountered during construction which resulted in the shifting of the site of the bridge to help with bridge construction. The bridge which was named the Kangaroo Valley Bridge was opened on 14 August 1879 by [[Thomas Garrett (Australian politician)|Thomas Garrett]], MP. The new bridge significantly improved access for the residents of the Valley, supported the five butter factories, the main township which had now gained a school, Post Office, churches and hotel and the nearby village of Barrengarry.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAlthough this timber truss bridge was constructed to be a \"permanent\" structure, it was soon discovered that the bridge's condition was deteriorating. In 1893 two large girders and wire rope were placed under the structure for additional strength. At the same time, planning began for the replacement of the bridge with a new suspension bridge which was to become far-famed as \"the greatest feat of engineering in the valley and the second greatest in the colony of New South Wales\".<ref name=nswshr-2024/><ref>Bayley (1953) in Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd (2001, 5)</ref>\n\nFarm amalgamations in the twentieth century have reduced the population greatly, and hobby farmers and retirees are increasingly attracted to the valley. Otherwise, the character of the township has not changed significantly in the last 130 years with a number of heritage buildings remaining. The valley is now a popular tourist destination with a range of accommodation choices available, including bed and breakfasts. The bridge forms an important landmark and an attraction, as well as to this day being still the main access across the Kangaroo River. The bridge is well-known to those who reside in the valley, and to the wider public of Sydney and the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] region.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of early bridges constructed in NSW=== \nThe first bridge constructed in NSW was built in 1788. The bridge was a simple timber bridge constructed over the [[Tank Stream]], near what is today the intersection of Pitt and Bridge Streets in the [[Sydney central business district]]. Soon after its construction, it was washed away and needed to be replaced. The first \"permanent\" bridge in NSW was the first bridge's successor. This was a stone arch bridge with a span of {{convert|24|ft|m|0|order=flip}} erected in 1803. However this was not a triumph of colonial bridge engineering, as it collapsed after only three years of service. It took a further five years for the bridge to be rebuilt in an improved form. Prior to the arrival of [[David Lennox]] in the Colony in 1832, NSW was without expert knowledge in bridge design and construction. Lennox, who had worked with the famous bridge engineer Thomas Telford, became the Superintendent of Bridges for NSW in 1833.<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-1>RTA, 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nDuring the first 60 years of the Colony, the majority of bridges were built from stone or timber, in the same manner as bridges being constructed in Britain and Europe. Stone was the bridge building material of choice in NSW, with construction costs kept low by the use of convict labour. However, with the cessation of convict transportation in the 1840s and subsequent rise in labour costs, bridge designers were forced to explore the use of other materials in bridge construction, leading to the eventual adoption of timber as the economical alternative. The size and quantity of readily available Australian hardwoods in the 1800s allowed the design and construction of efficient timber truss bridge designs reaching respectable spans.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of suspension bridges in NSW=== \nThe history of the construction of suspension road bridges in NSW is rather limited compared to the more commonly built timber truss, steel, lift and concrete bridges that have been constructed in NSW since the 1800s. Suspension bridges have been more widely used as pedestrian bridges such as at river, creek and bay crossings (for example [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]], [[Moonan Flat]] and Parsley Bay, [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]]).<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe first suspension road bridge constructed in NSW was at Long Gully, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]] in Sydney<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-2>Bridge No 172</ref> that was opened to traffic in 1892.<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-3>Figure 2</ref>\n\nIt was built as a timber deck suspension bridge with steel cables and ornate sandstone turreted towers by private developers to promote future residential development to the north. The original suspension bridge was constructed with a {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} main span that was supported by steel cables and hanger rods. The deck was stiffened by an undertruss which was pin connected at the centre of the span. The steel cables were supported on sandstone towers and anchored into bedrock at each end of the gorge. The wooden deck contained two traffic lanes plus two tram tracks and pedestrian footways.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Following taking ownership of Northbridge Bridge in 1935, the then [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] carried out inspections of the bridge which revealed that significant corrosion was occurring in the steelwork and cables. It was decided to replace the suspension bridge with a reinforced concrete arch with the original sandstone towers retained. The bridge was re-opened to traffic in 1939.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nHampden Bridge at Kangaroo Valley was the second suspension bridge to be built in NSW and is now the only surviving suspension road bridge from the Nineteenth Century. It replaced a previous timber truss bridge built in 1879. The new bridge was designed by Ernest Macartney De Burgh. It is noteworthy that De Burgh, in 1894 designed a suspension pedestrian bridge at the village of [[Tuena]], NSW. Whilst this bridge was of a differing design, it is likely that De Burgh had incorporated some of design calculations into the development of the design of Hampden Bridge. Hampden Bridge was opened in 1898.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of the Hampden Bridge=== \n;Design and construction \nDesign for the new suspension bridge to replace the deteriorating timber bridge began when the Department of Public Works Engineer, Ernest de Burgh visited the site on 21 April 1895 to survey the site for the new bridge. De Burgh's design for the bridge included stone towers quarried on site to support steel cables, steel hangers and timber decking with two stiffening trusses formed by the timber and steel railing of the bridge. De Burgh in the design of the stiffening trusses adopted the same design he had used on 20 freestanding timber truss bridges that were built between 1900 and 1905, for example Landsdowne Bridge over Mulwaree Ponds.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAn article titled ''A Magnificent Bridge - The New Structure over Kangaroo River'' appeared in ''The Kangaroo Valley Times'' in April 1896 announcing the imminent construction of the new bridge to be upstream of the previous bridge. The article also included a detailed description of the new bridge, including the following extract: \"The new bridge is to be constructed on the suspension principle, the spans being supports of ends of cables being about {{convert|253|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. To carry the cables there will be erected on each side of the river a pair of towers of sandstone masonry, produced from the immediate vicinity of the bridge. The actual length of the bridge will be about {{convert|400|ft|m|0|order=flip}} from pilaster to pilaster, and as the approaches measures about {{convert|528|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the total length of bridge and approaches will be {{convert|928|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.\"<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe company Loveridge & Hudson were engaged as the builders for the new bridge. Loveridge & Hudson had previously worked on a number of significant projects in Sydney, including modifications to the [[Customs House, Sydney|Customs House]] at [[Circular Quay]] and the renowned High Victorian architectural style [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]], [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney]].<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe first milestone celebrated in the construction period was on 30 May 1896 when the keystone to the southern end pier was laid by Florence Comer whose family had a number of associations with the Kangaroo Valley region. The keystone to the northern end pier was then laid less than 4 months later on 3 September 1896 by Barrengarry businessman Israel Karnofsky.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nConstruction progressed into the second half of 1896 with the completion of one abutment, partial completion of the other abutment; all masonry work, parapets and excavations undertaken for the placement of the concrete thrust blocks. However, a significant setback was the erection of the wire cables. New wire cables had to be sought from London, UK as the previously acquired cables were not satisfactory. It was not until July 1897 that first of the wire cables could be installed on the bridge. Without any more major setbacks, the construction of the bridge was progressed leading to its opening to traffic in February 1898.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nOn 2 February 1898, the Hampden Bridge was declared open to traffic by valley resident [[John King (Australian politician)|John King]] who also opened the former timber truss bridge. Leading up to the official opening, a number of tasks were identified as part of the \"clean up\" including the removal of the old timber bridge. However, this was not required as on 12 February 1898, the largest flood since 1870 ({{convert|18.5|m|ft|0}}) hit the region with a flood peak of {{convert|16.7|m}} resulting in the bridge breaking up and being washed downstream. Importantly, the new bridge was constructed {{convert|2|m}} higher than the previous bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe official opening took place on 19 May 1898. The opening ceremony was performed by the Minister for Works, [[James Henry Young]], MP before a crowd of 400 people. He was accompanied by Robert R. P. Hickson, Engineer-in-Chief and Ernest De Burgh, bridge designer. The Minister in his opening speech remarked that he \"might go over the great Australian continent, and would find nothing equal of it\". The bridge was named after Lord Hampden, [[Governor of New South Wales]] from 1895 to 1899. Total construction cost of the bridge was A\u00a38,382.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn 1987 the bridge was declared as one of fifty most historic bridges in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n==Description==\nA well-known local tourist attraction, Hampden Bridge carries Moss Vale Road (B73) across the Kangaroo River in the picturesque Kangaroo Valley, {{convert|120|km}} southwest of Sydney. The bridge is located in an undulating river valley terrain, with a sheer [[Sydney sandstone|sandstone]] face on its northern side and sandy inclined riverbank on the southern side. The river flows westward under the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> The bridge features four large [[Gothic Revival|Victorian Gothic Revival]] [[crenellate]]d [[turret]]s made of locally quarried sandstone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rogersandall.com/Spiked_Medieval-Spells.php |author=Sandall, R. |title=Medieval spells |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822124653/http://www.rogersandall.com/Spiked_Medieval-Spells.php |archivedate=22 August 2009}}</ref> This elaborate form, and the relatively sophisticated structural design of the span, reflect the importance of this river crossing at the time of construction: the Cambewarra Road (now the Moss Vale Road) was then a major route from Sydney to the south coast of NSW.<ref>{{Cite NSW HD|4301059|Hampden Bridge, Kangaroo Valley|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe deck is stiffened by timber side [[trusses]] which are hinged at midspan. The bridge, with a clear main [[Span (architecture)|span]] of {{convert|77|m}}, a sag in the cables of {{convert|15|m}}, sandstone tower height of {{convert|16.8|m}} and height above water also of {{convert|16.8|m}}, is an impressive structure in the local landscape and has been a landmark icon of the region for more than 100 years. The bridge is a single lane for vehicular traffic, with two narrow pedestrian walkways; with a maximum truck load of {{convert|42.5|t|ST LT}}, and no more than one truck on the bridge at a time.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nHampden Bridge is the only surviving suspension bridge from the colonial period in New South Wales;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kangaroovalleytourist.asn.au/content/members/hampdenbridge.html |title=Hampden Bridge |work=Kangaroo Valley Tourist |access-date=19 September 2006 }}</ref> and is the oldest and only timber suspension bridge still carrying vehicular traffic still in operation within Australia.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nIn 2012 the bridge underwent a major A$3&nbsp;million renovation by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], after many years of lobbying by local resident Bruce Ramsay, who agitated for the preservation of this iconic structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Towers and abutments===\n\nThe towers, constructed mainly from sandstone quarried on the site are of Victorian Gothic style, similar to the (former) suspension bridge at Northbridge in Sydney. Each tower has two [[columns]], joined by an elliptically arched crossbeam above traffic height. As described by ''The Kangaroo Valley Times'' of April 1896, \"These towers will be about {{convert|42|ft|m|0|order=flip}} high, built on concrete blocks resting on the present sandstone formation, the masonry to towers being {{convert|8|sqft|m2|0|order=flip}}. Each pair of towers will be connected by a wall containing an arched doorway {{convert|18|ft|m|0|order=flip}} high, and as the top sides of the centre walls and heads of towers will be finished with battlement tops, the whole will present the appearance of a structure similar to the famous \"Traitor's\" gate of the Tower of London...\".<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn section, the towers are formed by a solid mass concrete core and finished with sandstone blocks. They sit on mass concrete which in turn was cast onto excavations to solid sandstone. Immediately below the roller saddle bearings supporting the cables, the mass concrete is surmounted by bedstones composed of the rarely found hard trachyte weighing 3 tonnes and quarried at Mount Gibraltar at Bowral. The cables enter the towers through openings close to the battlement height of the cross wall, and each tower is then topped with an enlarged battlement. The finish of the sandstone is a combination of smooth [[ashlar]] battlement details and rock-faced finish on the main [[column]] faces. The original design incorporated drainage gratings in the floor of the upper battlements.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nExtending out from the base of each tower are sandstone [[parapet]] walls framing the approaches to the bridge. These are rubble filled, and topped with footpaths, kerbs and drainage grates on each side of the roadway. The parapet walls connect the towers to the cable anchorage structures. These consist of a shaft sunk some 25&nbsp;ft into sound sandstone. At the bottom of each shaft is an enlarged chamber where riveted steel beams transfer the tensile forces from the cables to upthrust in the sandstone above. At the surface there are cast iron shoulder castings which turn the cables from inclined to vertical. The thrust forces from these are transferred into the sandstone bedrock via further 5 ton trachyte thrust blocks set in concrete. Each anchor pit is surmounted by a small crenelated [[turret]], with an access cover adjacent. This allows access to the bottom of the pit via a full height access ladder.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nOne of the significant construction tasks was the excavation of drainage tunnels for the pit. On the Nowra side, the main drainage drive was some {{convert|100|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, opening to the northeast of the abutment, with a cross cut to the western pit. On the Moss Vale side the main drive was {{convert|60|ft|m|0|order=flip}} long. These tunnels were excavated by drilling and blasting.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Suspension cables and anchorages=== \nThe main cables of the bridge on each side, consist of fourteen 36mm diameter steel wire ropes, each with a specified tensile strength of {{convert|79.6|t|ST LT}}. The fourteen ropes are grouped into two cables of seven ropes each, and each rope consists of six strands, each having seven wires. They are anchored vertically in pits at either end of the bridge and have facility for length adjustment. Each rope has its own anchorage yoke around which it passes and is then fastened back to itself using six U-bolt clips. The fourteen yokes are connected by links and bolts to three anchorage girders using a pattern of 4-6-4, and these girders bear against the top of the anchorage pits.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nFrom the anchorage, the ropes run upwards, over a shoulder casting which bears on the thrust block, leave the sandstone [[pilaster]], run directly to the tower where they turn again on turning saddles which have roller bearings, and cross the span with a low point approximately one metre above deck level. In plan the cables angle inwards from the anchorage pits till they leave the towers, and then form a curve back to the tower on the far side of the bridge. This curve is created by the plane of the suspension hangers. The maintenance files on the bridge, describe that in 1970 the cables were coated with Davidsons X3016 Anticorrosive primer, BA77 Lumatint and Line 176 Black Finish.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Suspension hangers and cross girders===\n\nFrom the cables, suspension rods of varying length hang in an inclined plane at {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip}} centres to support the deck. Anchorage on the suspension cables is by way of suspension clips which have a U-bolt to support the eye at the top end of the hanger rods. They terminate through crossbeams which were originally timber, but are now boxes of galvanised steel formed by welding channel sections together. The hangers terminate with wedge-shaped washers, nuts and lock-nuts to allow adjustment of vertical profile.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nDeck Sitting on the cross beams, the current deck consists of longitudinal timber stringers supporting transverse decking of timbers topped by longitudinal timber sheeting, with a bituminous seal. The stringers are of varying depth to provide a camber to the deck.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs part of that work and to compensate for the loss of lateral and torsional stiffness of the new deck, a steel undertruss was installed. This connected to the abutment at each end and, by so doing, changed the manner in which the bridge was designed to articulate. It has since had a history of connection failures. Packed above deck level to allow drainage, there is a timber kerb on each side giving a clearance of {{convert|18|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. In its current configuration, plastic flaps are fixed approx 1m in from each kerb to provide pedestrian access to the bridge, leaving approximately {{convert|3.5|m|ft|0}} carriageway for traffic.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Deck trusses===\n\nA suspension bridge is inherently a very flexible structure, with its vertical geometry (referred to as a funicular polygon which approximates a catenary shape which applies when the load on a cable is completely uniform) varying to balance the loads at each node. Stiffening of a minor nature is provided by the deck, but this is insufficient to prevent large vertical movements for heavy vehicles. To control this effect, this bridge is provided with stiffening trusses along each side of the deck. Each [[truss]] is pinned at the abutment and at the centre of the span. The truss form is of the Pratt truss configuration with timber top and bottom chords and timber verticals, with steel rod crossed diagonals. This configuration allows the truss to transfer loads from where it is applied in both directions to the elastic supports provided at each node by the suspension cables.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe top and bottom chords consist of pairs of horizontal timber whilst the verticals are single timbers. Splices in the chords have been affected with steel side plates, some of which may be original and some replaced. The original mild steel diagonal rods have been replaced with high strength steel rods (presumably grade 8.8 steel with an ultimate tensile strength of 800 MPa). These bear on galvanised steel thrust plates which are either original or similar to the original detail. To assist with durability, the chords and vertical tops have been capped with galvanised steel flashing.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nBearings and Centre Hinge The bottom chords of the side trusses terminate at mid-span at a pin joining the two truss halves, and at the abutments in bearings. The northern bearing and centre pin are of fixed pin type whilst the southern bearing is of a swing link style, detailed to allow longitudinal movement. This movement is a combination of thermal and geometric due to articulation of the suspension system. Materials used in the bearings and other ferric components include cast and [[wrought iron]] and also cast and wrought steel.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn addition, the bridge consists of a number of other features of a secondary nature. This includes [[lighting]] which illuminates the towers. These are in vandal resistant boxes mounted outside the approach parapets. Downpipes and drainage was installed to remove water ponding in 1974 works. Galvanised wire mesh grillesare provided to prevent bird access to the suspension cable saddle areas on each tower. Security [[grille]]s are provided to prevent entry to the anchor pit drainage tunnels. A mesh grille was added as a nut catcher at the end of each steel truss diagonal. A maintenance gantry is suspended from the underside of the bridge. The gantry is a lightweight steel truss structure supporting a personnel platform whcih can be skidded from the upstream to the downstreem side of the bridge. Utilitiy pipes include a water main on the eastern side at the roadway level and two PVC conduits on the western side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nA number of plaques and historical markers are present either on the bridge or in its vicinity.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n=== Condition === \nAs at 5 July 2018, the bridge and its various components are in a good condition due to regular maintenance and upkeep.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> The bridge is highly intact and retains a high degree of integrity.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n \n=== Modifications and dates === \nAdapted from the Hampden Bridge Conservation Management Plan:<ref name=nswshr-2024/> \n* The bridge has undergone regular routine maintenance to preserve its operational use since its opening in 1898. \n* 1938-42{{spaced endash}}Major redecking works were undertaken. \n* 196{{spaced endash}}Load limit of {{convert|20|t|ST LT}} and speed limit of {{convert|15|mph|km/h|0|order=flip}} imposed on the bridge. \n* 1986{{spaced endash}}Road accident on bridge caused damage to sandstone bridge structure resulting in partial demolition of eastern bridge approach. \n* 2003{{spaced endash}}RTA imposed a {{convert|42.5|t|ST LT|adj=on}} load limit in August 2003. {{convert|50|t|ST LT|adj=on}} or [[B-train|B-doubles]] would be prohibited. \n* 2004{{spaced endash}}The RTA was instructed to install a duplicate \"Narrow Bridge\" and \"One Lane\" warning sign on the Moss Vale side and to investigate road safety options on the approaches and [[Monitor (architecture)|monitor]] implementation of signage. \n* 2005{{spaced endash}}Signage approaching the bridge \"no passing or overtaking\". \n* 2008/2009{{spaced endash}}Some timber decking was replaced as required to keep the bridge safe. \n* 2011{{spaced endash}}Major works undertaken (To be confirmed)<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \nAs at 10 July 2018, Hampden Bridge is of state significance as the second major suspension bridge in NSW, and as the only surviving timber decked vehicular suspension bridge constructed in the nineteenth century (1898). The bridge is associated with engineer Ernest Macartney de Burgh, and builders Loveridge and Hudson. Hampden bridge has the capacity to represent some of the key characteristics of a small class of Australian suspension bridges, both vehicular and footbridges; many of which do not survive, or do not survive in their original form. The Hampden Bridge also has historic significance because it facilitated the agricultural prominence of the Kangaroo Valley area in the first decades of the twentieth century. The form of the bridge, its relatively sophisticated structural design and elaborate tower castellations, reflects the cultural importance of this crossing at its time of construction, on what was then both a major route to the south of the state, and an area of emerging prosperity. The bridge now facilitates the growing importance of the area as a tourist destination. It is readily viewed and interpreted from the surrounding recreational areas and is held in high esteem by the local and wider community for its historic, aesthetic and technical qualities.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nHampden Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 August 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nIn service for over 110 years, on a route of major importance for the dairy industry of Kangaroo Valley and a route for communication and transport between both Sydney and inland centres and the south coast, Hampden Bridge facilitated the agricultural prominence of the Kangaroo Valley area in the first decades of the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe application of a relatively sophisticated but uncommon structural design, in combination with elaborate (and structurally unnecessary) tower castellations and other embellishments, reflect the cultural importance afforded this crossing on what was then both a major route to the south of the state, and an area of emerging prosperity. The bridge now facilitates the growing importance of the area as a tourist destination.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs a meeting and gathering place for the local Aboriginal people, the land occupied by Hampden Bridge is of historic significance. Kangaroo Valley was a place frequented as a meeting and gathering and the Dharawal (Tarawal or Thuruwal) travelled through the valley. The rock art sites nearby and camping areas are evidences of active Aboriginal occupation in this region.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nHampden Bridge, as a major work of design and construction and a rare application of the suspension bridge principles in NSW, is strongly associated with in particular, E.M. De Burgh, eminent design engineer in NSW, who designed the bridge and has today a bridge named after him over the [[Lane Cove River]], near [[Macquarie Park, New South Wales|Macquarie Park]] in Sydney. He was also responsible for the design of the [[Maldon, New South Wales|Maldon]] suspension bridge, completed in 1903. In 1913 he was appointed chief engineer for water supply and sewerage, and was responsible for the design and construction of the Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean dams (Sydney water supply), the Chichester scheme for [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and the Umberumberka scheme for [[Broken Hill]]. In 1921\u201325 he was a member of the [[Federal, New South Wales|Federal]] Capital Advisory Committee and prepared the original plans for [[Canberra]]'s water supply.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe bridge construction is also associated with the prominent late nineteenth century stonework and construction specialists, Loveridge and Hudson, with their company name having carried into the twentieth century. Loveridge and Hudson founded in 1882 are also notable for their quarrying and application of the rarely deposited rock, trachyte (also known as [[Bowral]] tracyhte) which was used in Hampden Bridge<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-4>Meyers, 2009</ref> as well in the construction of a number of historic buildings in Sydney (for example [[Queen Victoria Building]] and Equitable Life Assurance), Canberra (for example National Library and Treasury buildings) and the Southern Highlands (for example Bowral Courthouse).<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n \nThe bridge is a highly attractive and distinctive structure. It has outstanding landmark qualities, spanning a serpentine ravine and announcing its presence with magnificent castellated sandstone towers which are joined by an elliptically arched cross beam under which traffic passes. The structure forms a gateway to the Kangaroo Valley township and to the South Coast beyond along the road from [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]]. The construction of the bridge at the end of the nineteenth century was a major and technically challenging undertaking incorporating sophisticated structural engineering for its time.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe early suspension bridge form is well suited to the site, with its deep, sheer sided ravine, and the necessity for a single long span was exemplified by loss of the previous two spanned, timber truss bridge to a major flood. Notwithstanding, the loss of some original fabric over time necessitated by maintenance and structural reasons, the defining components of the bridge (towers and suspension system) are readily visible and interpretable from deck level and from public spaces provided to each side of the bridge, its context and setting and in the gully below. The movement of the deck and cables as heavy traffic passes across the bridge is a distinctive experience for drivers, pedestrians and observers.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> The early suspension form clearly demonstrates the available technology and scope of construction at the time of its construction. It is a demonstration of the inventiveness of the early engineers in finding design solutions to develop infrastructure in daunting terrain. As such it ranks with other engineering feats such as the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]].<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHampden Bridge has rarity value at a State level as the only surviving timber decked vehicular suspension bridge from the nineteenth century. The bridge is a rare example of a historic type of road bridge of which few were ever constructed in NSW. It was the second major suspension bridge in NSW. As the sole surviving suspension bridge in NSW, it provides rare evidence of this bridge type and construction especially since the earlier Long Gully, Northbridge suspension bridge was replaced with a concrete arch bridge in 1929.It retains rare qualities of early suspension bridge design and technology which were not commonly applied elsewhere in the state or in other engineering structures.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIt provides clear demonstration of a point in bridge design evolution which was rarely utilised in NSW in the late nineteenth century despite the availability of the technology. It also has a rare and hence unusual group of anchor structures which have a high degree of aesthetic detail when most of the construction effort for them should have been focussed on their strength and function.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge is of significance for its rarity value at the state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n== See also == \n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Australian roads|Engineering|Transport|Architecture}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)]]\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography === \n* {{cite book|author=Worley Parsons Pty Ltd|date=2011|title=Hampden Bridge Conservation Management Plan}}\n\n=== Attribution === \n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Hampden Bridge|dno=5056028|id=2024|year=2020|accessdate=18 February 2020}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hampden Bridge, Kangaroo Valley}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://visitkangaroovalley.com.au/hampden-bridge |title=Hampden Bridge |work=Visit Kangaroo Valley |publisher=Kangaroo Valley Chamber of Tourism and Commerce |date=n.d. }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/technology/industry/display/103041-historic-engineering-marker-hampden-bridge/photo/2 |title=Historic Engineering Marker -

The Wodi Wodi and Wandrawandian, Dharawal sub groups from the [[Illawarra]]-Shoalhaven area accessed the valley year round. Local Dharawal names are still used such as \"Noggarah\", a big gully and \"Parronrah\", suitable camping areas on the river side flats. Kangaroos and other wildlife abounded and the valley was considered a refuge or game reserve, sometimes used as a meeting place for the various family groups to replenish on their journey to the \"Cowpastures\" around the Camden/Appin area, where larger gatherings took place with neighbouring clans such as the Gundungurra from the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], to trade and conduct ceremony. Quite often disputes were also addressed through a formal process.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe arrival of the cedar getters and cattlemen in the 1800s changed the Aboriginal way of life and eventually only two family groups were recorded as living in the valley; at Trimbles Creek, north end of the valley and along the river on the southern side of the main village. By the early 1900s these remaining family groups were displaced from their lands and relocated with their remaining family groups clustered along the Illawarra/Shoalhaven coast, in places such as the (former) government reserves at Coomaditchee, Roseby Park and Wreck Bay.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nRegardless of the physical exorcising of the Aboriginal people from the land, the rich Aboriginal landscape of this valley remains captured in the numerous traditional campsites marked by stone artefact scatters along the \"Parronrah\" and axe grinding grooves at Barrengarry; and also in the special places such as rock art sites in the sandstone overhangs along the \"Noggarah\" that feed into the main river, accompanied by the sharing of stories and song lines describing the important connections people have to country, and most importantly in the continuing culture of the Aboriginal people of the region today.<ref name=nswshr-2024/><ref>Information provided by Rod Wellington</ref>\n\nEuropean settlement of the valley began in the late 1810s, with Richard Brooks sending cattle into the valley from the already settled districts of [[Berrima, New South Wales|Berrima]] and [[Sutton Forest, New South Wales|Sutton Forest]] in 1817 and then taking up a grant in the valley in 1820. Others moved into the valley from Sutton Forest to occupy land around [[Brogers Creek, New South Wales|Brogers Creek]]. Cedar- getting also commenced in the first half of this century, with Kangaroo Valley known for its red cedar. Kangaroo Valley was surveyed by Hoddle in 1831. Several areas were selected for cattle stations in the 1830s, but the 1841 census showed only seven men inhabiting the valley.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n[[Charles Throsby]] had passed through Kangaroo Valley in 1818 in search of a route from the coast to the settled districts along the [[Great South Road (New South Wales)|Great South Road]] ([[Hume Highway]]). Throsby's route may have laid the line for the [[Cambewarra, New South Wales|Cambewarra]] Road. The Cambewarra Road remained an important connection between the more closely settled districts to the north-west, with road access to [[Parramatta]] and [[Sydney]], and the south coast. With access from Sydney to [[Wollongong]] still difficult into the early twentieth century, travelling to the south coast via the Cambewarra Road, remained a popular way (and still is today) to reach the south coast.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n[[Henry Osborne (Australian politician)|Henry Osborne]], an Irish settler was a prominent landholder in the valley as well at other locations across the state and in 1837 held over 4000 acres. Charles McCaffrey, one of a group of settlers from Fermanagh, Ireland, brought dairy farming into the [[Kiama, New South Wales|Kiama]]-Shoalhaven region, settling at Barrengarry in 1846. He soon began a dairy and butter production. Once Kangaroo Valley was opened to free settlement, the population grew from 200 in 1861, to 1,400 in 1881 as dairy farmers flocked to the valley. The region developed to become the Colony's major butter producer. However, travelling out of the region to the coast and [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] was still restricted by having to cross a ford over the Kangaroo River.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs the local farming activities reached a peak in the 1870s, it was decided to construct a two span timber truss bridge over the Kangaroo River of the \"Old [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]]\" (Old PWD) design. The call for tenders was advertised in the [[Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales|Government Gazette]] 21 August 1874, p.&nbsp;2531. The awarding of the contract to build the bridge for A\u00a33,000 to the Braidwood based company, Kelly and Walsh was advertised in the Government Gazette 11 September 1876 p.&nbsp;3608. According to Clark (1998) there were many unforseen difficulties encountered during construction which resulted in the shifting of the site of the bridge to help with bridge construction. The bridge which was named the Kangaroo Valley Bridge was opened on 14 August 1879 by [[Thomas Garrett (Australian politician)|Thomas Garrett]], MP. The new bridge significantly improved access for the residents of the Valley, supported the five butter factories, the main township which had now gained a school, Post Office, churches and hotel and the nearby village of Barrengarry.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAlthough this timber truss bridge was constructed to be a \"permanent\" structure, it was soon discovered that the bridge's condition was deteriorating. In 1893 two large girders and wire rope were placed under the structure for additional strength. At the same time, planning began for the replacement of the bridge with a new suspension bridge which was to become far-famed as \"the greatest feat of engineering in the valley and the second greatest in the colony of New South Wales\".<ref name=nswshr-2024/><ref>Bayley (1953) in Austral Archaeology Pty Ltd (2001, 5)</ref>\n\nFarm amalgamations in the twentieth century have reduced the population greatly, and hobby farmers and retirees are increasingly attracted to the valley. Otherwise, the character of the township has not changed significantly in the last 130 years with a number of heritage buildings remaining. The valley is now a popular tourist destination with a range of accommodation choices available, including bed and breakfasts. The bridge forms an important landmark and an attraction, as well as to this day being still the main access across the Kangaroo River. The bridge is well-known to those who reside in the valley, and to the wider public of Sydney and the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] region.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of early bridges constructed in NSW=== \nThe first bridge constructed in NSW was built in 1788. The bridge was a simple timber bridge constructed over the [[Tank Stream]], near what is today the intersection of Pitt and Bridge Streets in the [[Sydney central business district]]. Soon after its construction, it was washed away and needed to be replaced. The first \"permanent\" bridge in NSW was the first bridge's successor. This was a stone arch bridge with a span of {{convert|24|ft|m|0|order=flip}} erected in 1803. However this was not a triumph of colonial bridge engineering, as it collapsed after only three years of service. It took a further five years for the bridge to be rebuilt in an improved form. Prior to the arrival of [[David Lennox]] in the Colony in 1832, NSW was without expert knowledge in bridge design and construction. Lennox, who had worked with the famous bridge engineer Thomas Telford, became the Superintendent of Bridges for NSW in 1833.<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-1>RTA, 2006</ref><ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nDuring the first 60 years of the Colony, the majority of bridges were built from stone or timber, in the same manner as bridges being constructed in Britain and Europe. Stone was the bridge building material of choice in NSW, with construction costs kept low by the use of convict labour. However, with the cessation of convict transportation in the 1840s and subsequent rise in labour costs, bridge designers were forced to explore the use of other materials in bridge construction, leading to the eventual adoption of timber as the economical alternative. The size and quantity of readily available Australian hardwoods in the 1800s allowed the design and construction of efficient timber truss bridge designs reaching respectable spans.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of suspension bridges in NSW=== \nThe history of the construction of suspension road bridges in NSW is rather limited compared to the more commonly built timber truss, steel, lift and concrete bridges that have been constructed in NSW since the 1800s. Suspension bridges have been more widely used as pedestrian bridges such as at river, creek and bay crossings (for example [[Hunter River (New South Wales)|Hunter River]], [[Moonan Flat]] and Parsley Bay, [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]]).<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe first suspension road bridge constructed in NSW was at Long Gully, [[Northbridge, New South Wales|Northbridge]] in Sydney<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-2>Bridge No 172</ref> that was opened to traffic in 1892.<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-3>Figure 2</ref>\n\nIt was built as a timber deck suspension bridge with steel cables and ornate sandstone turreted towers by private developers to promote future residential development to the north. The original suspension bridge was constructed with a {{convert|500|ft|m|0|order=flip}} main span that was supported by steel cables and hanger rods. The deck was stiffened by an undertruss which was pin connected at the centre of the span. The steel cables were supported on sandstone towers and anchored into bedrock at each end of the gorge. The wooden deck contained two traffic lanes plus two tram tracks and pedestrian footways.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Following taking ownership of Northbridge Bridge in 1935, the then [[Department of Main Roads (New South Wales)|Department of Main Roads]] carried out inspections of the bridge which revealed that significant corrosion was occurring in the steelwork and cables. It was decided to replace the suspension bridge with a reinforced concrete arch with the original sandstone towers retained. The bridge was re-opened to traffic in 1939.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nHampden Bridge at Kangaroo Valley was the second suspension bridge to be built in NSW and is now the only surviving suspension road bridge from the Nineteenth Century. It replaced a previous timber truss bridge built in 1879. The new bridge was designed by Ernest Macartney De Burgh. It is noteworthy that De Burgh, in 1894 designed a suspension pedestrian bridge at the village of [[Tuena]], NSW. Whilst this bridge was of a differing design, it is likely that De Burgh had incorporated some of design calculations into the development of the design of Hampden Bridge. Hampden Bridge was opened in 1898.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===History of the Hampden Bridge=== \n;Design and construction \nDesign for the new suspension bridge to replace the deteriorating timber bridge began when the Department of Public Works Engineer, Ernest de Burgh visited the site on 21 April 1895 to survey the site for the new bridge. De Burgh's design for the bridge included stone towers quarried on site to support steel cables, steel hangers and timber decking with two stiffening trusses formed by the timber and steel railing of the bridge. De Burgh in the design of the stiffening trusses adopted the same design he had used on 20 freestanding timber truss bridges that were built between 1900 and 1905, for example Landsdowne Bridge over Mulwaree Ponds.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAn article titled ''A Magnificent Bridge - The New Structure over Kangaroo River'' appeared in ''The Kangaroo Valley Times'' in April 1896 announcing the imminent construction of the new bridge to be upstream of the previous bridge. The article also included a detailed description of the new bridge, including the following extract: \"The new bridge is to be constructed on the suspension principle, the spans being supports of ends of cables being about {{convert|253|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. To carry the cables there will be erected on each side of the river a pair of towers of sandstone masonry, produced from the immediate vicinity of the bridge. The actual length of the bridge will be about {{convert|400|ft|m|0|order=flip}} from pilaster to pilaster, and as the approaches measures about {{convert|528|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, the total length of bridge and approaches will be {{convert|928|ft|m|0|order=flip}}.\"<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe company Loveridge & Hudson were engaged as the builders for the new bridge. Loveridge & Hudson had previously worked on a number of significant projects in Sydney, including modifications to the [[Customs House, Sydney|Customs House]] at [[Circular Quay]] and the renowned High Victorian architectural style [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]], [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney]].<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe first milestone celebrated in the construction period was on 30 May 1896 when the keystone to the southern end pier was laid by Florence Comer whose family had a number of associations with the Kangaroo Valley region. The keystone to the northern end pier was then laid less than 4 months later on 3 September 1896 by Barrengarry businessman Israel Karnofsky.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nConstruction progressed into the second half of 1896 with the completion of one abutment, partial completion of the other abutment; all masonry work, parapets and excavations undertaken for the placement of the concrete thrust blocks. However, a significant setback was the erection of the wire cables. New wire cables had to be sought from London, UK as the previously acquired cables were not satisfactory. It was not until July 1897 that first of the wire cables could be installed on the bridge. Without any more major setbacks, the construction of the bridge was progressed leading to its opening to traffic in February 1898.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nOn 2 February 1898, the Hampden Bridge was declared open to traffic by valley resident [[John King (Australian politician)|John King]] who also opened the former timber truss bridge. Leading up to the official opening, a number of tasks were identified as part of the \"clean up\" including the removal of the old timber bridge. However, this was not required as on 12 February 1898, the largest flood since 1870 ({{convert|18.5|m|ft|0}}) hit the region with a flood peak of {{convert|16.7|m}} resulting in the bridge breaking up and being washed downstream. Importantly, the new bridge was constructed {{convert|2|m}} higher than the previous bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe official opening took place on 19 May 1898. The opening ceremony was performed by the Minister for Works, [[James Henry Young]], MP before a crowd of 400 people. He was accompanied by Robert R. P. Hickson, Engineer-in-Chief and Ernest De Burgh, bridge designer. The Minister in his opening speech remarked that he \"might go over the great Australian continent, and would find nothing equal of it\". The bridge was named after Lord Hampden, [[Governor of New South Wales]] from 1895 to 1899. Total construction cost of the bridge was A\u00a38,382.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn 1987 the bridge was declared as one of fifty most historic bridges in NSW.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n==Description==\nA well-known local tourist attraction, Hampden Bridge carries Moss Vale Road (B73) across the Kangaroo River in the picturesque Kangaroo Valley, {{convert|120|km}} southwest of Sydney.

Each tower has two [[columns]], joined by an elliptically arched crossbeam above traffic height. As described by ''The Kangaroo Valley Times'' of April 1896, \"These towers will be about {{convert|42|ft|m|0|order=flip}} high, built on concrete blocks resting on the present sandstone formation, the masonry to towers being {{convert|8|sqft|m2|0|order=flip}}. Each pair of towers will be connected by a wall containing an arched doorway {{convert|18|ft|m|0|order=flip}} high, and as the top sides of the centre walls and heads of towers will be finished with battlement tops, the whole will present the appearance of a structure similar to the famous \"Traitor's\" gate of the Tower of London...\".<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn section, the towers are formed by a solid mass concrete core and finished with sandstone blocks. They sit on mass concrete which in turn was cast onto excavations to solid sandstone. Immediately below the roller saddle bearings supporting the cables, the mass concrete is surmounted by bedstones composed of the rarely found hard trachyte weighing 3 tonnes and quarried at Mount Gibraltar at Bowral. The cables enter the towers through openings close to the battlement height of the cross wall, and each tower is then topped with an enlarged battlement. The finish of the sandstone is a combination of smooth [[ashlar]] battlement details and rock-faced finish on the main [[column]] faces. The original design incorporated drainage gratings in the floor of the upper battlements.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nExtending out from the base of each tower are sandstone [[parapet]] walls framing the approaches to the bridge. These are rubble filled, and topped with footpaths, kerbs and drainage grates on each side of the roadway. The parapet walls connect the towers to the cable anchorage structures. These consist of a shaft sunk some 25&nbsp;ft into sound sandstone. At the bottom of each shaft is an enlarged chamber where riveted steel beams transfer the tensile forces from the cables to upthrust in the sandstone above. At the surface there are cast iron shoulder castings which turn the cables from inclined to vertical. The thrust forces from these are transferred into the sandstone bedrock via further 5 ton trachyte thrust blocks set in concrete. Each anchor pit is surmounted by a small crenelated [[turret]], with an access cover adjacent. This allows access to the bottom of the pit via a full height access ladder.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nOne of the significant construction tasks was the excavation of drainage tunnels for the pit. On the Nowra side, the main drainage drive was some {{convert|100|ft|m|0|order=flip}}, opening to the northeast of the abutment, with a cross cut to the western pit. On the Moss Vale side the main drive was {{convert|60|ft|m|0|order=flip}} long. These tunnels were excavated by drilling and blasting.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Suspension cables and anchorages=== \nThe main cables of the bridge on each side, consist of fourteen 36mm diameter steel wire ropes, each with a specified tensile strength of {{convert|79.6|t|ST LT}}. The fourteen ropes are grouped into two cables of seven ropes each, and each rope consists of six strands, each having seven wires. They are anchored vertically in pits at either end of the bridge and have facility for length adjustment. Each rope has its own anchorage yoke around which it passes and is then fastened back to itself using six U-bolt clips. The fourteen yokes are connected by links and bolts to three anchorage girders using a pattern of 4-6-4, and these girders bear against the top of the anchorage pits.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nFrom the anchorage, the ropes run upwards, over a shoulder casting which bears on the thrust block, leave the sandstone [[pilaster]], run directly to the tower where they turn again on turning saddles which have roller bearings, and cross the span with a low point approximately one metre above deck level. In plan the cables angle inwards from the anchorage pits till they leave the towers, and then form a curve back to the tower on the far side of the bridge. This curve is created by the plane of the suspension hangers. The maintenance files on the bridge, describe that in 1970 the cables were coated with Davidsons X3016 Anticorrosive primer, BA77 Lumatint and Line 176 Black Finish.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Suspension hangers and cross girders===\n\nFrom the cables, suspension rods of varying length hang in an inclined plane at {{convert|6|ft|m|0|order=flip}} centres to support the deck. Anchorage on the suspension cables is by way of suspension clips which have a U-bolt to support the eye at the top end of the hanger rods. They terminate through crossbeams which were originally timber, but are now boxes of galvanised steel formed by welding channel sections together. The hangers terminate with wedge-shaped washers, nuts and lock-nuts to allow adjustment of vertical profile.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nDeck Sitting on the cross beams, the current deck consists of longitudinal timber stringers supporting transverse decking of timbers topped by longitudinal timber sheeting, with a bituminous seal. The stringers are of varying depth to provide a camber to the deck.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs part of that work and to compensate for the loss of lateral and torsional stiffness of the new deck, a steel undertruss was installed. This connected to the abutment at each end and, by so doing, changed the manner in which the bridge was designed to articulate. It has since had a history of connection failures. Packed above deck level to allow drainage, there is a timber kerb on each side giving a clearance of {{convert|18|ft|m|0|order=flip}} between kerbs. In its current configuration, plastic flaps are fixed approx 1m in from each kerb to provide pedestrian access to the bridge, leaving approximately {{convert|3.5|m|ft|0}} carriageway for traffic.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n===Deck trusses===\n\nA suspension bridge is inherently a very flexible structure, with its vertical geometry (referred to as a funicular polygon which approximates a catenary shape which applies when the load on a cable is completely uniform) varying to balance the loads at each node. Stiffening of a minor nature is provided by the deck, but this is insufficient to prevent large vertical movements for heavy vehicles. To control this effect, this bridge is provided with stiffening trusses along each side of the deck. Each [[truss]] is pinned at the abutment and at the centre of the span. The truss form is of the Pratt truss configuration with timber top and bottom chords and timber verticals, with steel rod crossed diagonals. This configuration allows the truss to transfer loads from where it is applied in both directions to the elastic supports provided at each node by the suspension cables.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe top and bottom chords consist of pairs of horizontal timber whilst the verticals are single timbers. Splices in the chords have been affected with steel side plates, some of which may be original and some replaced. The original mild steel diagonal rods have been replaced with high strength steel rods (presumably grade 8.8 steel with an ultimate tensile strength of 800 MPa). These bear on galvanised steel thrust plates which are either original or similar to the original detail. To assist with durability, the chords and vertical tops have been capped with galvanised steel flashing.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nBearings and Centre Hinge The bottom chords of the side trusses terminate at mid-span at a pin joining the two truss halves, and at the abutments in bearings. The northern bearing and centre pin are of fixed pin type whilst the southern bearing is of a swing link style, detailed to allow longitudinal movement. This movement is a combination of thermal and geometric due to articulation of the suspension system. Materials used in the bearings and other ferric components include cast and [[wrought iron]] and also cast and wrought steel.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIn addition, the bridge consists of a number of other features of a secondary nature. This includes [[lighting]] which illuminates the towers. These are in vandal resistant boxes mounted outside the approach parapets. Downpipes and drainage was installed to remove water ponding in 1974 works. Galvanised wire mesh grillesare provided to prevent bird access to the suspension cable saddle areas on each tower. Security [[grille]]s are provided to prevent entry to the anchor pit drainage tunnels. A mesh grille was added as a nut catcher at the end of each steel truss diagonal. A maintenance gantry is suspended from the underside of the bridge. The gantry is a lightweight steel truss structure supporting a personnel platform whcih can be skidded from the upstream to the downstreem side of the bridge. Utilitiy pipes include a water main on the eastern side at the roadway level and two PVC conduits on the western side of the bridge.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nA number of plaques and historical markers are present either on the bridge or in its vicinity.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n=== Condition === \nAs at 5 July 2018, the bridge and its various components are in a good condition due to regular maintenance and upkeep.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> The bridge is highly intact and retains a high degree of integrity.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n \n=== Modifications and dates === \nAdapted from the Hampden Bridge Conservation Management Plan:<ref name=nswshr-2024/> \n* The bridge has undergone regular routine maintenance to preserve its operational use since its opening in 1898. \n* 1938-42{{spaced endash}}Major redecking works were undertaken. \n* 196{{spaced endash}}Load limit of {{convert|20|t|ST LT}} and speed limit of {{convert|15|mph|km/h|0|order=flip}} imposed on the bridge. \n* 1986{{spaced endash}}Road accident on bridge caused damage to sandstone bridge structure resulting in partial demolition of eastern bridge approach. \n* 2003{{spaced endash}}RTA imposed a {{convert|42.5|t|ST LT|adj=on}} load limit in August 2003. {{convert|50|t|ST LT|adj=on}} or [[B-train|B-doubles]] would be prohibited. \n* 2004{{spaced endash}}The RTA was instructed to install a duplicate \"Narrow Bridge\" and \"One Lane\" warning sign on the Moss Vale side and to investigate road safety options on the approaches and [[Monitor (architecture)|monitor]] implementation of signage. \n* 2005{{spaced endash}}Signage approaching the bridge \"no passing or overtaking\". \n* 2008/2009{{spaced endash}}Some timber decking was replaced as required to keep the bridge safe. \n* 2011{{spaced endash}}Major works undertaken (To be confirmed)<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n== Heritage listing == \nAs at 10 July 2018, Hampden Bridge is of state significance as the second major suspension bridge in NSW, and as the only surviving timber decked vehicular suspension bridge constructed in the nineteenth century (1898). The bridge is associated with engineer Ernest Macartney de Burgh, and builders Loveridge and Hudson. Hampden bridge has the capacity to represent some of the key characteristics of a small class of Australian suspension bridges, both vehicular and footbridges; many of which do not survive, or do not survive in their original form. The Hampden Bridge also has historic significance because it facilitated the agricultural prominence of the Kangaroo Valley area in the first decades of the twentieth century. The form of the bridge, its relatively sophisticated structural design and elaborate tower castellations, reflects the cultural importance of this crossing at its time of construction, on what was then both a major route to the south of the state, and an area of emerging prosperity. The bridge now facilitates the growing importance of the area as a tourist destination. It is readily viewed and interpreted from the surrounding recreational areas and is held in high esteem by the local and wider community for its historic, aesthetic and technical qualities.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nHampden Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 August 2019 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nIn service for over 110 years, on a route of major importance for the dairy industry of Kangaroo Valley and a route for communication and transport between both Sydney and inland centres and the south coast, Hampden Bridge facilitated the agricultural prominence of the Kangaroo Valley area in the first decades of the twentieth century.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe application of a relatively sophisticated but uncommon structural design, in combination with elaborate (and structurally unnecessary) tower castellations and other embellishments, reflect the cultural importance afforded this crossing on what was then both a major route to the south of the state, and an area of emerging prosperity. The bridge now facilitates the growing importance of the area as a tourist destination.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nAs a meeting and gathering place for the local Aboriginal people, the land occupied by Hampden Bridge is of historic significance. Kangaroo Valley was a place frequented as a meeting and gathering and the Dharawal (Tarawal or Thuruwal) travelled through the valley. The rock art sites nearby and camping areas are evidences of active Aboriginal occupation in this region.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''\n\nHampden Bridge, as a major work of design and construction and a rare application of the suspension bridge principles in NSW, is strongly associated with in particular, E.M. De Burgh, eminent design engineer in NSW, who designed the bridge and has today a bridge named after him over the [[Lane Cove River]], near [[Macquarie Park, New South Wales|Macquarie Park]] in Sydney. He was also responsible for the design of the [[Maldon, New South Wales|Maldon]] suspension bridge, completed in 1903. In 1913 he was appointed chief engineer for water supply and sewerage, and was responsible for the design and construction of the Cordeaux, Avon and Nepean dams (Sydney water supply), the Chichester scheme for [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and the Umberumberka scheme for [[Broken Hill]]. In 1921\u201325 he was a member of the [[Federal, New South Wales|Federal]] Capital Advisory Committee and prepared the original plans for [[Canberra]]'s water supply.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe bridge construction is also associated with the prominent late nineteenth century stonework and construction specialists, Loveridge and Hudson, with their company name having carried into the twentieth century. Loveridge and Hudson founded in 1882 are also notable for their quarrying and application of the rarely deposited rock, trachyte (also known as [[Bowral]] tracyhte) which was used in Hampden Bridge<ref name=nswshr-2024-2024-4>Meyers, 2009</ref> as well in the construction of a number of historic buildings in Sydney (for example [[Queen Victoria Building]] and Equitable Life Assurance), Canberra (for example National Library and Treasury buildings) and the Southern Highlands (for example Bowral Courthouse).<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n \nThe bridge is a highly attractive and distinctive structure. It has outstanding landmark qualities, spanning a serpentine ravine and announcing its presence with magnificent castellated sandstone towers which are joined by an elliptically arched cross beam under which traffic passes. The structure forms a gateway to the Kangaroo Valley township and to the South Coast beyond along the road from [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]]. The construction of the bridge at the end of the nineteenth century was a major and technically challenging undertaking incorporating sophisticated structural engineering for its time.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nThe early suspension bridge form is well suited to the site, with its deep, sheer sided ravine, and the necessity for a single long span was exemplified by loss of the previous two spanned, timber truss bridge to a major flood. Notwithstanding, the loss of some original fabric over time necessitated by maintenance and structural reasons, the defining components of the bridge (towers and suspension system) are readily visible and interpretable from deck level and from public spaces provided to each side of the bridge, its context and setting and in the gully below. The movement of the deck and cables as heavy traffic passes across the bridge is a distinctive experience for drivers, pedestrians and observers.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> The early suspension form clearly demonstrates the available technology and scope of construction at the time of its construction. It is a demonstration of the inventiveness of the early engineers in finding design solutions to develop infrastructure in daunting terrain. As such it ranks with other engineering feats such as the [[Zig Zag Railway]] at [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]].<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge meets this criterion at a state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nHampden Bridge has rarity value at a State level as the only surviving timber decked vehicular suspension bridge from the nineteenth century. The bridge is a rare example of a historic type of road bridge of which few were ever constructed in NSW. It was the second major suspension bridge in NSW. As the sole surviving suspension bridge in NSW, it provides rare evidence of this bridge type and construction especially since the earlier Long Gully, Northbridge suspension bridge was replaced with a concrete arch bridge in 1929.It retains rare qualities of early suspension bridge design and technology which were not commonly applied elsewhere in the state or in other engineering structures.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\nIt provides clear demonstration of a point in bridge design evolution which was rarely utilised in NSW in the late nineteenth century despite the availability of the technology. It also has a rare and hence unusual group of anchor structures which have a high degree of aesthetic detail when most of the construction effort for them should have been focussed on their strength and function.<ref name=nswshr-2024/> Hampden Bridge is of significance for its rarity value at the state level.<ref name=nswshr-2024/>\n\n== See also == \n{{stack|{{portal|New South Wales|Australian roads|Engineering|Transport|Architecture}}}}\n* [[List of bridges in Australia]]\n* [[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n* [[Hampden Bridge (Wagga Wagga)]]\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography === \n* {{cite book|author=Worley Parsons Pty Ltd|date=2011|title=Hampden Bridge Conservation Management Plan}}\n\n=== Attribution === \n{{NSW-SHR-CC|name=Hampden Bridge|dno=5056028|id=2024|year=2020|accessdate=18 February 2020}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hampden Bridge, Kangaroo Valley}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://visitkangaroovalley.com.au/hampden-bridge |title=Hampden Bridge |work=Visit Kangaroo Valley |publisher=Kangaroo Valley Chamber of Tourism and Commerce |date=n.d. }}\n*{{cite web |url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/technology/industry/display/103041-historic-engineering-marker-hampden-bridge/photo/2 |title=Historic Engineering Marker - Hampden Bridge |work=Historic Engineer Marker |publisher=Monument Australia |date=2010 }}\n\n{{Road infrastructure in regional New South Wales}}\n\n[[Category:1898 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Road bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1898]]\n[[Category:Suspension bridges in Australia]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Southern Tablelands]]\n[[Category:Sandstone bridges in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "remove {{tl|small}} as per MOS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampden_Bridge,_Kangaroo_Valley"}

A [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] force commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Douglas H. Cooper]] composed mostly of [[cavalry]] led by Colonel [[Joseph O. Shelby]] and a brigade of [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Native Americans]] moved into southwestern [[Missouri]] and encamped near the town of Newtonia.  A [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] force commanded by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James G. Blunt]] moved to intercept Cooper's force.  Blunt's advance force, led by Brigadier General [[Frederick Salomon]], reached the vicinity of Newtonia on September 29, and attacked Cooper's position at Newtonia on September 30.  While the Union assault was initially successful, a Confederate [[counterattack]] drove the Union troops off of the field.  After the retreating Union column was hit by [[artillery]] fire, the retreat turned into a disorderly [[rout]].  However, the later advance of a large Union force led Cooper to decide to retreat out of the state of Missouri.\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victories at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Island Number Ten]] in early 1862, the state of [[Missouri]] went through a period of decreased military activity.  However, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[Sterling Price]] sent some of his troops into Missouri in order to get supplies and new volunteers, and Confederate officers such as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Joseph C. Porter]] raided into the state.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=141}}  The region was also plagued by [[guerrilla warfare]], including the prominent [[bushwhacker]] [[William Quantrill]].  At one point Quantrill's guerrillas combined with a regular Confederate force commanded by Colonel [[John T. Hughes]].  This combined force defeated a Union force at the [[First Battle of Independence]] on August 11.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=144{{endash}}145}}  Union forces suffered another defeat on August 15, this time at the [[Battle of Lone Jack]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=146{{endash}}147}}  Eventually, the chaotic state of affairs led to the Union's commander of the [[Department of the Missouri]], [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[John M. Schofield]], being replaced by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Samuel R. Curtis]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=149}}\n\nAs part of this chaotic state of affairs, Confederate Colonel [[Douglas H. Cooper]] began an incursion into southwestern Missouri.  Cooper's force included the Confederate [[cavalry]] of Colonel [[Joseph O. Shelby]] as well as a brigade of [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Confederate-sympathizing Native Americans]].  The Confederates reached the town of [[Newtonia, Missouri|Newtonia]], where they were welcomed by some of the local citizens.  Meanwhile, Union troops under Brigadier General [[James G. Blunt]] learned that Cooper was in Newtonia and began moving south to intercept the Confederate force.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=147}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Newtonia I Battlefield Missouri.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Newtonia I Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nBlunt's advance force was commanded by Brigadier General [[Frederick Salomon]], who sent a small force to [[Granby, Missouri]] on September 29 to determine if the town was occupied.  While no Confederates occupied the town proper, Salomon's advance guard encountered a portion of Shelby's cavalry.  The next day, Salomon would advance to Newtonia, beginning the First Battle of Newtonia.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=124}}  Historian [[Shelby Foote]] would later estimate the total strength of Salomon's column to be about 4,000 men.  Foote also estimated the total Confederate strength to be around 5,500 men,{{sfn|Foote|1958|p=784}} an estimate which is consistent with the range found in other sources.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=125}}\n\nOn September 30, Cooper sent a portion of his force forward into Newtonia, and sent an [[artillery battery]] commanded by Hiram Bledsoe to support them.  Shelby's troopers were left in reserve.  Salomon sent twelve of his [[cannons]] forwards, which were eventually able to suppress Bledsoe's battery.  Salomon then sent some of his infantry, including the [[9th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|9th Wisconsin]], to [[Flank (military)|flank]] the forward Confederate line.  The movement was successful, and Cooper's men were driven out of Newtonia.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=125}}  However, a [[counterattack]] by Shelby's Confederates blunted the Union attack, and a combined charge by Shelby and the Native American soldiers drove Salomon's infantry from the field.  Some of the Union artillery was hit by Confederate fire, causing the Union retreat to turn into a [[rout]].  Some of the Union soldiers fled all the way to [[Sarcoxie, Missouri]], which was about ten miles away from Newtonia.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=134}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDespite defeating Salomon's Union force, the Confederate position around Newtonia was still not secure.  Salomon had represented only the advance guard of a much larger Union force, and Cooper decided to fall back instead of risking a battle.  Shelby's cavalry was tasked with providing Cooper with a [[rear guard]], and the Native American troops retreated back to [[Indian Territory]].{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=126}}   The rest of the Confederates retreated back into northwestern [[Arkansas]].  During the battle at Newtonia, the Confederates suffered 78 casualties, while the Union lost 245 men.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=134}}  As the Confederates engaged at Newtonia retreated from Missouri, other Confederate troops attacked and forced the surrender of a small Union garrison at the [[Battle of Clark's Mill]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=148{{endash}}149}}  First Newtonia would be the first battle in the American Civil War in which Native Americans played a significant role on both sides.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ostmeyer |first1=Andy |title=Damnable Time |url=https://www.joplinglobe.com/news/local_news/damnable-time/article_cc8be2c7-a000-5a93-94c7-84834c13d206.html |publisher=The Joplin Globe |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 1864, the [[Second Battle of Newtonia]] would be fought near the site of the 1862 battle.  In the 1864 battle, a Union army commanded by Blunt attacked and defeated a Confederate army led by Sterling Price as the Confederates retreated southwards after being defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Westport|Westport, Missouri]] and [[Battle of Mine Creek|Mine Creek, Kansas]].

A [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] force commanded by [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Douglas H. Cooper]] composed mostly of [[cavalry]] led by Colonel [[Joseph O. Shelby]] and a brigade of [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Native Americans]] moved into southwestern [[Missouri]] and encamped near the town of Newtonia.  A [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] force commanded by [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James G. Blunt]] moved to intercept Cooper's force.  Blunt's advance force, led by Brigadier General [[Frederick Salomon]], reached the vicinity of Newtonia on September 29, and attacked Cooper's position at Newtonia on September 30.  While the Union assault was initially successful, a Confederate [[counterattack]] drove the Union troops off of the field.  After the retreating Union column was hit by [[artillery]] fire, the retreat turned into a disorderly [[rout]].  However, the later advance of a large Union force led Cooper to decide to retreat out of the state of Missouri.\n\n==Background==\nAfter [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victories at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] and the [[Battle of Island Number Ten]] in early 1862, the state of [[Missouri]] went through a period of decreased military activity.  However, [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] general [[Sterling Price]] sent some of his troops into Missouri in order to get supplies and new volunteers, and Confederate officers such as [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Joseph C. Porter]] raided into the state.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=141}}  The region was also plagued by [[guerrilla warfare]], including the prominent [[bushwhacker]] [[William Quantrill]].  At one point Quantrill's guerrillas combined with a force commanded by official Confederate officer Colonel [[John T. Hughes]].  This combined force defeated a Union force at the [[First Battle of Independence]] on August 11.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=144{{endash}}145}}  Union forces suffered another defeat on August 15, this time at the [[Battle of Lone Jack]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=146{{endash}}147}}  Eventually, the chaotic state of affairs led Union [[Department of the Missouri]] commander [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[John M. Schofield]] to be replaced by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Samuel R. Curtis]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=149}}\n\nAs part of this chaotic state of affairs, Confederate Colonel [[Douglas H. Cooper]] began an incursion into southwestern Missouri.  Cooper's force included the Confederate [[cavalry]] of Colonel [[Joseph O. Shelby]] as well as a brigade of [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Confederate-sympathizing Native Americans]].  Cooper's force reached the town of [[Newtonia, Missouri]], where the Confederates were welcomed by some of the local citizens.  Meanwhile, Union troops under Brigadier General [[James G. Blunt]] learned that Cooper was in Newtonia and began moving south to intercept the Confederate force.{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|p=147}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Newtonia I Battlefield Missouri.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Newtonia I Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nBlunt's advance force was commanded by Brigadier General [[Frederick Salomon]], who sent a small force to [[Granby, Missouri]] on September 29 to determine if the town was occupied.  While no Confederates occupied the town proper, Salomon's advance guard encountered a portion of Shelby's cavalry.  The next day, Salomon would advance to Newtonia, beginning the First Battle of Newtonia.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=124}}  Historian [[Shelby Foote]] would later estimate the total strength of Salomon's column to be about 4,000 men.  Foote also estimated the total Confederate strength to be around 5,500 men,{{sfn|Foote|1958|p=784}} an estimate which is consistent with the range found in other sources.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=125}}\n\nOn September 30, Cooper sent a portion of his force forward into Newtonia, and sent an [[artillery battery]] commanded by Hiram Bledsoe to support them.  Shelby's troopers were left in reserve.  Salomon sent twelve of his [[cannons]] forwards, which were eventually able to suppress Bledsoe's battery.  Salomon then sent some of his infantry, including the [[9th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment|9th Wisconsin]], to [[Flank (military)|flank]] the forward Confederate line.  The movement was successful, and Cooper's men were driven out of Newtonia.{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=125}}  However, a [[counterattack]] by Shelby's Confederates blunted the Union attack, and a combined charge by Shelby and the Native American soldiers drove Salomon's infantry from the field.  Some of the Union artillery was hit by Confederate fire, causing the Union retreat to turn into a [[rout]].  Some of the Union soldiers fled all the way to [[Sarcoxie, Missouri]], which was about ten miles away from Newtonia.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=134}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nDespite defeating Salomon's Union force, the Confederate position around Newtonia was still not secure.  Salomon had represented only the advance guard of a much larger Union force, and Cooper decided to fall back instead of risking a battle.  Shelby's cavalry was tasked with providing Cooper with a [[rear guard]], and the Native American troops retreated back to [[Indian Territory]].{{sfn|O'Flaherty|1954|p=126}}   The rest of the Confederates retreated back into northwestern [[Arkansas]].  During the battle at Newtonia, the Confederates suffered 78 casualties, while the Union lost 245 men.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=134}}  As the Confederates engaged at Newtonia retreated from Missouri, other Confederate troops attacked and forced the surrender of a small Union garrison at the [[Battle of Clark's Mill]].{{sfn|Gerteis|2012|pp=148{{endash}}149}}  First Newtonia would be the first battle in the American Civil War in which Native Americans played a significant role on both sides.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ostmeyer |first1=Andy |title=Damnable Time |url=https://www.joplinglobe.com/news/local_news/damnable-time/article_cc8be2c7-a000-5a93-94c7-84834c13d206.html |publisher=The Joplin Globe |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn October 28, 1864, the [[Second Battle of Newtonia]] would be fought near the site of the 1862 battle.  In the 1864 battle, a Union army commanded by Blunt attacked and defeated a Confederate army led by Sterling Price as the Confederates retreated southwards after being defeated at the battles of [[Battle of Westport|Westport, Missouri]] and [[Battle of Mine Creek|Mine Creek, Kansas]].  Much as he did in the 1862 battle, Shelby would play a prominent role for the Confederates in the Second Battle of Newtonia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Second Battle of Newtonia |url=https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/newtonia |website=battlefields.org |publisher=American Battlefield Trust |accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==First Battle of Newtonia Historic District==\nThe '''First Battle of Newtonia Historic District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was first listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2004.

This causes Phil to realize that he is seeing images of his former love rival, [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]), being murdered on New Years Eve 2005. The dream ends with Phil finding himself face-to-face with [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny Allen]] ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]), the square's criminal kingpin who appears to taunt Phil by laughing towards him. Later on that morning, Phil seemingly wishes to spend time with his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) by arranging for them to go and play a round of [[golf]]. Grant agrees and the brothers set off to play gold, but stop at a roadside caf\u00e9 in Essex. There, the two discuss their own personal problems - namely Phil's struggle to avoid a relapse in his [[alcoholism]] - over lunch. A strange man walks into the caf\u00e9 and makes a sarcastic joke about Phil and Grant's bald heads, remarking: \"[[Right Said Fred]] have reformed.\" The stranger follows Phil into the toilets and starts singing \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\". Phil reacts by punching the stranger and knocking him out. When they leave the caf\u00e9, Grant tells Phil that he has been seeing a therapist in a bid to confront his demons. They pass a large house in the countryside and Phil orders Grant to stop. Phil announces that he is ready to confront his demons and that they have arrived at Johnny's house.\n\nPhil scours Johnny's house in a bid to break in, while Grant begs him to stop being stupid. Phil explains that he is keeping the promise that he made with Dennis' wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) to confront Johnny for Dennis's murder, which Johnny had ordered. Johnny spots Phil on his [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system and quickly finds him. Phil attacks Johnny but Johnny manages to overpower him with a stick. Grant soon arrives on the scene and finds Phil being threatened by Johnny and his henchman, [[Danny Moon]] ([[Jake Maskall]]). Grant beats up Danny, while Johnny re-enters his office and starts arguing with his daughter [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) - who is angry with him for being an alcoholic. Phil finally intimidates Johnny into admitting his involvement in Dennis' death, and begins to throttle him. [[Image:Phil&Grant&Danny.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] face execution at the hands of [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny]]'s henchman [[Danny Moon|Danny]]]]\n\nPhil's anger towards Johnny gets more intense and he threatens to shoot him, but Grant stops him from pulling the trigger just in time. Danny once again tries to defend Johnny but receives another beating from Phil and Grant, and stays at the house while Johnny flees in his car. Phil and Grant give chase to Johnny and follow him to a deserted goods yard, where Phil almost runs him over. Johnny escapes and then Grant and Phil get into an argument. Grant insults Phil for being a bad father and almost gets run over himself, but Phil smashes the car into a pile of skips instead. The skips collapse on Phil's car but he emerges unscathed. Johnny returns from where he had left the Mitchells and holds them at gunpoint.\n\nArmed with a gun, Johnny frogmarches Phil and Grant to a soundproofed cell back at his house. Grant quickly establishes that Johnny is intent on killing them both, and his expectations are confirmed when Johnny orders Danny to lead them away into the nearby woods to kill them both and then bury their bodies. Phil hears a gunshot and opens his eyes to see Danny lying dead on the floor. Phil turns his head to see Danny's brother, [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]), standing nearby with a gun - looking mortified; Jake had just killed Danny despite not wanting to do so. Jake is devastated at having killed his brother, as he only wanted to stop him from killing someone. After the Mitchells leave, Jake buries Danny's body in the woods. Meanwhile, Ruby discovers mobile phone footage of Dennis' murder. She announces that she has informed the police about Johnny's crimes and that they are on their way to the house. Johnny is arrested and immediately confesses to the police that he murdered his gangland predecessor, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), and later ordered Danny to kill Dennis. \n\n===Aftermath===\nJohnny is eventually convicted of killing Andy and ordering the murder of Dennis. He receives a sentence of life imprisonment and the judge recommends that he should spend at least 27 years behind bars before being considered for release, but six months into his sentence, he suffers a heart attack in prison and dies in hospital the next day - after receiving a visit from Ruby's boyfriend, [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), and being taunted by the latter over his plan to extract their family assets.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EastEnders}}\n\n[[Category:EastEnders storylines]]\n[[Category:2006 in British television]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Johnny&Danny.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny]] and [[Danny Moon|Danny]] plan their revenge on the [[Mitchell family|Mitchells]]]]\n\n\"'''Get Johnny Week'''\" is a week-long storyline in the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', which was first screened at the end of March 2006.

A strange man walks into the caf\u00e9 and makes a sarcastic joke about Phil and Grant's bald heads, remarking: \"[[Right Said Fred]] have reformed.\" The stranger follows Phil into the toilets and starts singing \"[[I'm Too Sexy]]\". Phil reacts by punching the stranger and knocking him out. When they leave the caf\u00e9, Grant tells Phil that he has been seeing a therapist in a bid to confront his demons. They pass a large house in the countryside and Phil orders Grant to stop. Phil announces that he is ready to confront his demons and that they have arrived at Johnny's house.\n\nPhil scours Johnny's house in a bid to break in, while Grant begs him to stop being stupid. Phil explains that he is keeping the promise that he made with Dennis' wife [[Sharon Watts|Sharon]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) to confront Johnny for Dennis's murder, which Johnny had ordered. Johnny spots Phil on his [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] system and quickly finds him. Phil attacks Johnny but Johnny manages to overpower him with a stick. Grant soon arrives on the scene and finds Phil being threatened by Johnny and his henchman, [[Danny Moon]] ([[Jake Maskall]]). Grant beats up Danny, while Johnny re-enters his office and starts arguing with his daughter [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) - who is angry with him for being an alcoholic. Phil finally intimidates Johnny into admitting his involvement in Dennis' death, and begins to throttle him. [[Image:Phil&Grant&Danny.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] face execution at the hands of [[Johnny Allen (EastEnders)|Johnny]]'s henchman [[Danny Moon|Danny]]]]\n\nPhil's anger towards Johnny gets more intense and he threatens to shoot him, but Grant stops him from pulling the trigger just in time. Danny once again tries to defend Johnny but receives another beating from Phil and Grant, and stays at the house while Johnny flees in his car. Phil and Grant give chase to Johnny and follow him to a deserted goods yard, where Phil almost runs him over. Johnny escapes and then Grant and Phil get into an argument. Grant insults Phil for being a bad father and almost gets run over himself, but Phil smashes the car into a pile of skips instead. The skips collapse on Phil's car but he emerges unscathed. Johnny returns from where he had left the Mitchells and holds them at gunpoint.\n\nArmed with a gun, Johnny frogmarches Phil and Grant to a soundproofed cell back at his house. Grant quickly establishes that Johnny is intent on killing them both, and his expectations are confirmed when Johnny orders Danny to lead them away into the nearby woods to kill them both and then bury their bodies. Phil hears a gunshot and opens his eyes to see Danny lying dead on the floor. Phil turns his head to see Danny's brother, [[Jake Moon]] ([[Joel Beckett]]), standing nearby with a gun - looking mortified; Jake had just killed Danny despite not wanting to do so. Jake is devastated at having killed his brother, as he only wanted to stop him from killing someone. After the Mitchells leave, Jake buries Danny's body in the woods. Meanwhile, Ruby discovers mobile phone footage of Dennis' murder. She announces that she has informed the police about Johnny's crimes and that they are on their way to the house. Johnny is arrested and immediately confesses to the police that he murdered his gangland predecessor, [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]), and later ordered Danny to kill Dennis. \n\n===Aftermath===\nJohnny is eventually convicted of killing Andy and ordering the murder of Dennis. He receives a sentence of life imprisonment and the judge recommends that he should spend at least 27 years behind bars before being considered for release, but six months into his sentence, he suffers a heart attack in prison and dies in hospital the next day - after receiving a visit from Ruby's boyfriend, [[Sean Slater]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), and being taunted by the latter over his plan to extract their family assets.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EastEnders}}\n\n[[Category:EastEnders storylines]]\n[[Category:2006 in British television]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlot:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Johnny_Week"}

It was historically associated with a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'' (\"flask\"; ''pl. fiaschi''). However, the ''fiasco'' is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] (later [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]) created the Chianti recipe of 70% [[Sangiovese]], 15% [[Canaiolo]] and 15% [[Malvasia|Malvasia bianca]] in the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\">J. Robinson (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'' Third Edition pg 162\u2013163 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nThe first definition of a wine-area called ''Chianti'' was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of [[Gaiole (Chianti)|Gaiole]], [[Castellina (Chianti)|Castellina]] and [[Radda (Chianti)|Radda]]; the so-called ''Lega del Chianti'' and later ''Provincia del Chianti'' (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely re-drawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and R\u00f9fina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new Chianti Classico area added ''in Chianti'' to their name-such as [[Greve in Chianti]] which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled \"Chianti Classico\" come from the biggest sub-area of Chianti, that includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may boast the black rooster seal (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers.<ref>Consorzio del Marchio Storico</ref><ref>Consorzio del vino Chianti Classico</ref>  Other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of [[Florence]] and Montalbano in the south of [[Pistoia]], originate in the respective named provinces: [[Province of Siena|Siena]] for the Colli Senesi, [[Province of Florence|Florence]] for the Colli Fiorentini, [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] for the Colli Aretini and [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]] for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed ''Montespertoli''.\n\nDuring the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\">M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 147\u2013159 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}</ref> Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4\u20137) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as [[Chianti Superiore]], although Chianti from the \"Classico\" sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as \"Superiore\".\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Chianti (region)|History of Chianti}}\n\n[[File:Grand Duke CosimoIII of Tuscany by van Douven.jpg|left|thumb|150px|left|In 1716 Cosimo III de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, legislated the first official boundaries of the Chianti region in what is today part of the Chianti Classico DOCG.]]\n\nThe earliest documentation of a \"Chianti wine\" dates back to the 13th century when viticulture was known to flourish in the ''\"Chianti Mountains\"'' around Florence. The merchants in the nearby townships of Castellina, Gaiole and Radda formed the ''Lega del Chianti'' (League of Chianti) to produce and promote the local wine. In 1398, records note that the earliest incarnation of Chianti was as a white wine.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\" /> In 1716 [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' ([[Castellina in Chianti]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]] and [[Radda in Chianti]]) as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long stretch|abbr=off|order=flip}} of hillside north of Greve near [[:it:Spedaluzzo|Spedaluzzo]] as the only officially recognised producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until July 1932, when the Italian government expanded the Chianti zone to include the outlying areas of [[Barberino Val d'Elsa]], [[Chiocchio]], [[:it:Robbiano|Robbiano]], [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]] and [[:it:Strada in Chianti|Strada]]. Subsequent expansions in 1967 would eventually bring the Chianti zone to cover a very large area all over central Tuscany.\n\n[[File:Bettino Ricasoli.jpg|150px|thumb|Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] developed the first \"modern\" Chianti recipe that was Sangiovese based.]]\n\nBy the 18th century, Chianti was widely recognised as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make Chianti at this point is unknown. [[Ampelographer]]s find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer [[Cosimo Villifranchi]] who noted that [[Canaiolo]] was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, [[Mammolo]] and [[Marzemino]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/> It was not until the work of the Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] that the modern \"Chianti recipe\" as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\">H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 414-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}</ref> Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and [[Malvasia]] playing supporting roles. In the mid-19th century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include [[Trebbiano]]) and 5% other local red varieties. In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the \"Ricasoli formula\" of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10\u201330% Malvasia and Trebbiano.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe late 19th century saw a period of economic and political upheaval. First came [[Uncinula necator|oidium]] and then the [[phylloxera epidemic]] would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' heralded the beginning of the [[Italian diaspora]] that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\"/> Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like [[Trebbiano]] and Sangiovese clones such as the ''Sangiovese di Romagna'' from the nearby [[Romagna]] region. Following the [[Second World War]], the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 376-379\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 376-379 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref> By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''fiasco''. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality wine. These wines eventually became known as the \"[[Super Tuscans]]\".<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n[[File:Italian DOCG Chianti label.jpg|left|thumb|The Italian DOCG Chianti label]]\nMany of the producers behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% [[varietal]] Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending [[French (wine)|French]] grape varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques such as the use of new [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]]. The prices and [[wine ratings]] of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Chianti subregions==\n[[File:sottozone chianti.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Chianti wine area within Tuscany]]\n\nThe Chianti region covers a vast area of Tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regions. Other well known Sangiovese-based [[Tuscan wines]] such as [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]] could be bottled and labelled under the most basic designation of \"Chianti\" if their producers chose to do so.<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\">T. Stevenson ''\"The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia\"'' pg 282-286 Dorling Kindersley 2005 {{ISBN|0-7566-1324-8}}</ref> Within the collective Chianti region more than 8 million cases of wines classified as DOC level or above are produced each year. Today, most Chianti falls under two major designations of Chianti DOCG, which includes basic level Chianti, as well as that from seven designated sub-zones, and Chianti Classico DOCG.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/> Together, these two Chianti zones produce the largest volume of DOC/G wines in Italy.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe Chianti DOCG covers all the Chianti wine and includes a large stretch of land encompassing the western reaches of the [[province of Pisa]] near the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the Florentine hills in the province of Florence to the north, to the [[province of Arezzo]] in the east and the Siena hills to the south. Within this regions are vineyards that overlap the DOCG regions of Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]]. Any Sangiovese-based wine made according to the Chianti guidelines from these vineyards can be labelled and marked under the basic Chianti DOCG should the producer wish to use the designation.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nWithin the Chianti DOCG there are eight defined sub-zones that are permitted to affix their name to the [[wine label]].<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\"/>  Wines that are labelled as simply Chianti are made either from a blend from these sub-zones or include grapes from peripheral areas not within the boundaries of a sub-zone. The sub-zones are (clockwise from the north): the Colli Fiorentini which is located south of the city of Florence; Chianti Rufina in the northeastern part of the zone located around the commune of [[Rufina]]; Classico in the centre of Chianti, across the provinces of Florence and Siena; Colli Aretini in the Arezzo province to the east; Colli Senesi south of Chianti Classico in the Siena hills, which is the largest of the sub-zones and includes the Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano areas; Colline Pisane, the westernmost sub-zone in the province of Pisa; Montespertoli located within the Colli Fiorentini around the commune of [[Montespertoli]]; Montalbano in the north-west part of the zone which includes the [[Carmignano (wine)|Carmignano]] DOCG.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/> {{As of|2006}}, there were {{convert|786|acre|ha|order=flip}} under production in Montalbano, {{convert|2236|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Fiorentini, {{convert|140|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Montespertoli, {{convert|1840|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Rufina, {{convert|8780|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Senesi, {{convert|380|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Colline Pisane, {{convert|1603|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Aretini, and an additional {{convert|25511|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the peripheral areas that do not fall within one of the sub-zone classifications.

The four communes of Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti are located entirely within the boundaries of the Classico area with parts of Barberino Val d'Elsa, San Casciano in Val di Pesa and [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]] in the [[province of Florence]] as well as [[Castelnuovo Berardenga]] and [[Poggibonsi]] in the [[province of Siena]] included within the permitted boundaries of Chianti Classico. The soil and geography of this subregion can be quite varied, with altitudes ranging from {{convert|820|to|2000|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}, and rolling hills producing differing [[macroclimate]]s. There are two main soil types in the area: a weathered sandstone known as ''[[alberese]]'' and a bluish-gray [[chalk]]y [[marlstone]] known as ''[[galestro]]''.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/> The soil in the north is richer and more fertile with more ''galestro'', with the soil gradually becoming harder and stonier with more ''albarese'' in the south. In the north, the [[Arno River]] can have an influence on the climate, keeping the temperatures slightly cooler, an influence that diminishes further south in the warmer Classico territory towards Castelnuovo Berardenga.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nChianti Classico are premium Chianti wines that tend to be medium-bodied with firm [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] and medium-high to high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]]. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-[[palate]] and [[finish (wine)|finish]] than at the front of the mouth. As with [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]], Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the [[most ripe (wine)|most ripe]] and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nThe production of Chianti Classico is realised under the supervision of [[:it:Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico|Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico]], a union of producers in the Chianti Classico subregion. The Consorzio was founded with the aim of promoting the wines of the subregion, improving quality and preventing [[wine fraud]]. Since the 1980s, the foundation has sponsored extensive research into the viticultural and winemaking practice of the Chianti Classico area, particularly in the area of clonal research. In the last three decades, more than 50% of the vineyards in the Chianti Classico subregion have been replanted with improved Sangiovese clones and modern vineyard techniques as part of the Consorzio Chianti Classico's project \"Chianti 2000\".<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nIn 2014 a new category of Chianti Classico was introduced: Chianti Classico Gran Selezione.<ref name=CCGS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|title=Chianti Classico Gran Selezione: Identity Card|work=chianticlassico.com|publisher=Consorzio Vino Chianti Classico|accessdate=January 22, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122121031/http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gran Selezione is made exclusively from a winery\u2019s own grapes grown according to stricter regulations compared to regular Chianti Classico.<ref name=CCGS /> Gran Selezione is granted to a Chianti Classico after it passes a suitability test conducted\nby authorised laboratories and after it is approved by a special tasting committee.<ref name=CCGS />  The creation of the Chianti Classico Gran Selezione DOCG has been criticized, with some describing it as being \"Needless; an extra layer of confusion created by marketing people hoping to help Chianti Classico out of a sales crisis.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.decanter.com/premium/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-revisited-382839/|title=What has Gran Selezione done for Chianti? - Decanter|date=2018-01-23|work=Decanter|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-09/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-makes-a-super-premium-wine-grab|title=Chianti Classico Makes a Grab for the Super-Premium Market|last=McCoy|first=Elin|date=|website=Bloomberg|publication-date=10 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Greater Chianti region ===\n\n[[File:Fiaschi of basic Chianti.jpg|right|thumb|''Fiaschi'' of basic Chianti that does not specify any sub-zone on the label.

Located in the [[Arno]] valley near the town of [[Pontassieve]], the Rufina region includes much area in the [[Pomino]] region, an area that has a long history of wine production. The area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to {{convert|2,950|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}. The [[vineyard soil]]s of the area are predominantly [[marl]] and [[chalk]]. The Florentine merchant families of the [[Antinori]] and [[Frescobaldi]] own the majority of the vineyards in Rufina. Chianti from the Rufina area is characterised by its multi-layered [[complexity (wine)|complexity]] and elegance.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe Colli Fiorentini subregion has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy Florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries. Many foreign \"[[flying winemaker]]s\" have had a hand in this development, bringing global [[viticulture]] and wine-making techniques to the Colli Fiorentini. Located in the hills between the Chianti Classico area and Arno valley, the wines of the Colli Fiorentini vary widely depending on producer, but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/> The Montespertoli sub-zone was part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-zone until 2002 when it became its own tiny enclave.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n\nThe Montalbano subregion is located in the shadow of the Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar situation exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Grapes and classification==\nSince 1996 the blend for Chianti and Chianti Classico has been 75\u2013100% Sangiovese, up to 10% Canaiolo and up to 20% of any other approved red grape variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Syrah.

Lighter [[body (wine)|bodied]] styles will generally have a higher proportion of white grape varieties blended in, while Chiantis that have only red grape varieties will be fuller and richer. While only 15% of Cabernet Sauvignon is permitted in the blend, the nature of the grape variety can have a dominant personality in the Chianti blend and be a strong influence in the wine.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nChianti Classico wines are characterised in their youth by their predominantly floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet. As the wine ages, aromas of tobacco and leather can emerge. Chiantis tend to have medium-high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]] and medium [[tannins (wine)|tannins]]. Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of cherry, plum and raspberry and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert [[Tom Stevenson]] notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage, with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\"/>\n\n===Chianti Superiore===\nChianti Superiore is an Italian DOCG wine produced in the provinces of Arezzo, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato and Siena, in Tuscany. Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996.<ref>D.M. 5.08.1996</ref> Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. Vineyards registered in Chianti sub-zones other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Aging is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of aging, of which three must be in the bottle. Therefore, it cannot be bottled before the June after picking or sold to consumers before the next September.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"4\" align=center| 2004 production<ref name=\"Unione Italiana Vini\"/>\n|-\n! || Chianti Superiore || Other Chianti || % Ch.

However, the ''fiasco'' is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] (later [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]) created the Chianti recipe of 70% [[Sangiovese]], 15% [[Canaiolo]] and 15% [[Malvasia|Malvasia bianca]] in the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\">J. Robinson (ed) ''The Oxford Companion to Wine'' Third Edition pg 162\u2013163 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nThe first definition of a wine-area called ''Chianti'' was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of [[Gaiole (Chianti)|Gaiole]], [[Castellina (Chianti)|Castellina]] and [[Radda (Chianti)|Radda]]; the so-called ''Lega del Chianti'' and later ''Provincia del Chianti'' (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely re-drawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and R\u00f9fina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new Chianti Classico area added ''in Chianti'' to their name-such as [[Greve in Chianti]] which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled \"Chianti Classico\" come from the biggest sub-area of Chianti, that includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may boast the black rooster seal (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers.<ref>Consorzio del Marchio Storico</ref><ref>Consorzio del vino Chianti Classico</ref>  Other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of [[Florence]] and Montalbano in the south of [[Pistoia]], originate in the respective named provinces: [[Province of Siena|Siena]] for the Colli Senesi, [[Province of Florence|Florence]] for the Colli Fiorentini, [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] for the Colli Aretini and [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]] for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed ''Montespertoli''.\n\nDuring the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\">M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 147\u2013159 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}</ref> Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4\u20137) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as [[Chianti Superiore]], although Chianti from the \"Classico\" sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as \"Superiore\".\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Chianti (region)|History of Chianti}}\n\n[[File:Grand Duke CosimoIII of Tuscany by van Douven.jpg|left|thumb|150px|left|In 1716 Cosimo III de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, legislated the first official boundaries of the Chianti region in what is today part of the Chianti Classico DOCG.]]\n\nThe earliest documentation of a \"Chianti wine\" dates back to the 13th century when viticulture was known to flourish in the ''\"Chianti Mountains\"'' around Florence. The merchants in the nearby townships of Castellina, Gaiole and Radda formed the ''Lega del Chianti'' (League of Chianti) to produce and promote the local wine. In 1398, records note that the earliest incarnation of Chianti was as a white wine.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\" /> In 1716 [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' ([[Castellina in Chianti]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]] and [[Radda in Chianti]]) as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long stretch|abbr=off|order=flip}} of hillside north of Greve near [[:it:Spedaluzzo|Spedaluzzo]] as the only officially recognised producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until July 1932, when the Italian government expanded the Chianti zone to include the outlying areas of [[Barberino Val d'Elsa]], [[Chiocchio]], [[:it:Robbiano|Robbiano]], [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]] and [[:it:Strada in Chianti|Strada]]. Subsequent expansions in 1967 would eventually bring the Chianti zone to cover a very large area all over central Tuscany.\n\n[[File:Bettino Ricasoli.jpg|150px|thumb|Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] developed the first \"modern\" Chianti recipe that was Sangiovese based.]]\n\nBy the 18th century, Chianti was widely recognised as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make Chianti at this point is unknown. [[Ampelographer]]s find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer [[Cosimo Villifranchi]] who noted that [[Canaiolo]] was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, [[Mammolo]] and [[Marzemino]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/> It was not until the work of the Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] that the modern \"Chianti recipe\" as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\">H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 414-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}</ref> Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and [[Malvasia]] playing supporting roles. In the mid-19th century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include [[Trebbiano]]) and 5% other local red varieties. In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the \"Ricasoli formula\" of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10\u201330% Malvasia and Trebbiano.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe late 19th century saw a period of economic and political upheaval. First came [[Uncinula necator|oidium]] and then the [[phylloxera epidemic]] would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' heralded the beginning of the [[Italian diaspora]] that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\"/> Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like [[Trebbiano]] and Sangiovese clones such as the ''Sangiovese di Romagna'' from the nearby [[Romagna]] region. Following the [[Second World War]], the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 376-379\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 376-379 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref> By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''fiasco''. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality wine. These wines eventually became known as the \"[[Super Tuscans]]\".<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n[[File:Italian DOCG Chianti label.jpg|left|thumb|The Italian DOCG Chianti label]]\nMany of the producers behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% [[varietal]] Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending [[French (wine)|French]] grape varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques such as the use of new [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]]. The prices and [[wine ratings]] of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Chianti subregions==\n[[File:sottozone chianti.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Chianti wine area within Tuscany]]\n\nThe Chianti region covers a vast area of Tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regions. Other well known Sangiovese-based [[Tuscan wines]] such as [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]] could be bottled and labelled under the most basic designation of \"Chianti\" if their producers chose to do so.<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\">T.

Within this regions are vineyards that overlap the DOCG regions of Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]].

Located in the [[Arno]] valley near the town of [[Pontassieve]], the Rufina region includes much area in the [[Pomino]] region, an area that has a long history of wine production. The area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to {{convert|2,950|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}. The [[vineyard soil]]s of the area are predominantly [[marl]] and [[chalk]]. The Florentine merchant families of the [[Antinori]] and [[Frescobaldi]] own the majority of the vineyards in Rufina. Chianti from the Rufina area is characterised by its multi-layered [[complexity (wine)|complexity]] and elegance.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe Colli Fiorentini subregion has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy Florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries. Many foreign \"[[flying winemaker]]s\" have had a hand in this development, bringing global [[viticulture]] and wine-making techniques to the Colli Fiorentini. Located in the hills between the Chianti Classico area and Arno valley, the wines of the Colli Fiorentini vary widely depending on producer, but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/> The Montespertoli sub-zone was part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-zone until 2002 when it became its own tiny enclave.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n\nThe Montalbano subregion is located in the shadow of the Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar situation exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Grapes and classification==\nSince 1996 the blend for Chianti and Chianti Classico has been 75\u2013100% Sangiovese, up to 10% Canaiolo and up to 20% of any other approved red grape variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Syrah. Since 2006, the use of white grape varieties such as Malvasia and Trebbiano have been prohibited in Chianti Classico.<ref name=\"Robinson.com\">Jancis Robinson ''\"[http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20080701.html Chianti Classico - thoroughly red now] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126031131/http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/20080701.html |date=26 January 2013 }}\"'' 5 July 2008</ref> Chianti Classico must have a minimum [[alcohol level]] of at least 12% with a minimum of 7 months aging in oak, while Chianti Classicos labeled ''[[riserva]]'' must be aged at least 24 months at the winery, with a minimum alcohol level of at least 12.5%.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/> The harvest [[yields (wine)|yields]] for Chianti Classico are restricted to no more than {{convert|7.5|tonne/ha|0|abbr=in}}.

Lighter [[body (wine)|bodied]] styles will generally have a higher proportion of white grape varieties blended in, while Chiantis that have only red grape varieties will be fuller and richer. While only 15% of Cabernet Sauvignon is permitted in the blend, the nature of the grape variety can have a dominant personality in the Chianti blend and be a strong influence in the wine.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nChianti Classico wines are characterised in their youth by their predominantly floral and cinnamon spicy bouquet. As the wine ages, aromas of tobacco and leather can emerge. Chiantis tend to have medium-high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]] and medium [[tannins (wine)|tannins]]. Basic level Chianti is often characterised by its juicy fruit notes of cherry, plum and raspberry and can range from simple quaffing wines to those approaching the level of Chianti Classico. Wine expert [[Tom Stevenson]] notes that these basic everyday-drinking Chiantis are at their peak drinking qualities often between three and five years after vintage, with premium examples having the potential to age for four to eight years. Well-made examples of Chianti Classico often have the potential to age and improve in the bottle for six to twenty years.<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\"/>\n\n===Chianti Superiore===\nChianti Superiore is an Italian DOCG wine produced in the provinces of Arezzo, Florence, Pisa, Pistoia, Prato and Siena, in Tuscany. Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996.<ref>D.M. 5.08.1996</ref> Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. Vineyards registered in Chianti sub-zones other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Aging is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of aging, of which three must be in the bottle. Therefore, it cannot be bottled before the June after picking or sold to consumers before the next September.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"4\" align=center| 2004 production<ref name=\"Unione Italiana Vini\"/>\n|-\n! || Chianti Superiore || Other Chianti || % Ch.
