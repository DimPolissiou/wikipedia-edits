His works depicted historical, [[biblical]], and [[classical antiquity|classical]] subject matter in an [[Academic art|academic style]].  His paintings were enormously popular, and expensive, during his lifetime, but fell out of critical favour for many decades in the early 20th century.  \n\nLeighton was the bearer of the shortest-lived [[peerage]] in history; after only one day his hereditary peerage became extinct upon his death.<ref>[http://www.leighrayment.com/reppeers/peerrecords.htm Peerage records] \u2013 Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Flaming June, by Frederic Lord Leighton (1830-1896).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Flaming June]]'' (1895; [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]]).]]\n[[File:Lord Leighton, Frederic, After Vespers, 1871.jpg|thumb|''After Vespers'' (1871; [[Princeton University Art Museum]])]]\n\nLeighton was born in [[Scarborough, England|Scarborough]] to Augusta Susan and Dr. Frederic Septimus Leighton.

He then received his artistic training on the European continent, first from [[Eduard von Steinle]] and then from [[Giovanni Costa]]. At age 17, in the summer of 1847, he met the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in Frankfurt and drew his portrait, in graphite and gouache on paper \u2014 the only known full-length study of Schopenhauer done from life.<ref>Crowther, Paul, and Miruna Cuzman. \"A Rediscovered Contemporary Full-Length Sketch-Portrait of Schopenhauer by Frederic, Lord Leighton.\" Schopenhauer Jahrbuch, 92 Band, Konigshausen und Neumann, 2011: 301\u2013306.</ref> When he was 24 he was in [[Florence]]; he studied at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]], and painted the procession of the [[Cimabue]] Madonna through the Borgo Allegri. From 1855 to 1859 he lived in Paris, where he met [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]].\n\nIn 1860, he moved to London, where he associated with the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s. He designed [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s tomb for [[Robert Browning]] in the [[English Cemetery, Florence]] in 1861. In 1864 he became an associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and in 1878 he became its President (1878\u201396).  His 1877 sculpture, ''[[Athlete Wrestling with a Python]]'', was considered at its time to inaugurate a renaissance in contemporary British sculpture, referred to as the [[New Sculpture]]. American art critic [[Earl Shinn]] claimed at the time that \"Except Leighton, there is scarce any one capable of putting up a correct frescoed figure in the archway of the Kensington Museum.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shinn|first1=Earl|title=The World's Art: From the International Exhibition|date=1880|publisher=Lovering|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=S6tBAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His paintings represented Britain at the great [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exhibition]].\n\nLeighton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1878,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=24651 |date=29 November 1878 |page=6695}}</ref> and was created a baronet, of Holland Park Road in the Parish of [[St Mary Abbots]], Kensington, in the County of Middlesex, eight years later.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25551 |date=22 January 1886 |page=328 }}</ref> He was the first painter to be given a [[peerage]], in the [[1896 New Year Honours]].

Enquiry is furthermore hindered by the fact that Leighton left no diaries and his letters are telling in their lack of reference to his personal circumstances. No definite primary evidence has yet come to light that effectively dispels the secrecy that Leighton built up around himself, although it is clear that he did court a circle of younger men around his artistic studio.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOn his death his [[baron]]y was extinguished after existing for only a day; this is a record in the [[Peerage]].

His works depicted historical, [[biblical]], and [[classical antiquity|classical]] subject matter in an [[Academic art|academic style]].  His paintings were enormously popular, and expensive, during his lifetime, but fell out of critical favour for many decades in the early 20th century.  \n\nLeighton was the bearer of the shortest-lived [[peerage]] in history; after only one day his hereditary peerage became extinct upon his death.<ref>[http://www.leighrayment.com/reppeers/peerrecords.htm Peerage records] \u2013 Leigh Rayment's Peerage Page</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Flaming June, by Frederic Lord Leighton (1830-1896).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Flaming June]]'' (1895; [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]]).]]\n[[File:Lord Leighton, Frederic, After Vespers, 1871.jpg|thumb|''After Vespers'' (1871; [[Princeton University Art Museum]])]]\n\nLeighton was born in [[Scarborough, England|Scarborough]] to Augusta Susan and Dr. Frederic Septimus Leighton.

He then received his artistic training on the European continent, first from [[Eduard von Steinle]] and then from [[Giovanni Costa]]. At age 17, in the summer of 1847, he met the philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in Frankfurt and drew his portrait, in graphite and gouache on paper \u2014 the only known full-length study of Schopenhauer done from life.<ref>Crowther, Paul, and Miruna Cuzman. \"A Rediscovered Contemporary Full-Length Sketch-Portrait of Schopenhauer by Frederic, Lord Leighton.\" Schopenhauer Jahrbuch, 92 Band, Konigshausen und Neumann, 2011: 301\u2013306.</ref> When he was 24 he was in [[Florence]]; he studied at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti]], and painted the procession of the [[Cimabue]] Madonna through the Borgo Allegri. From 1855 to 1859 he lived in Paris, where he met [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]] and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet|Millet]].\n\nIn 1860, he moved to London, where he associated with the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s. He designed [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'s tomb for [[Robert Browning]] in the [[English Cemetery, Florence]] in 1861. In 1864 he became an associate of the [[Royal Academy]] and in 1878 he became its President (1878\u201396).  His 1877 sculpture, ''[[Athlete Wrestling with a Python]]'', was considered at its time to inaugurate a renaissance in contemporary British sculpture, referred to as the [[New Sculpture]]. American art critic [[Earl Shinn]] claimed at the time that \"Except Leighton, there is scarce any one capable of putting up a correct frescoed figure in the archway of the Kensington Museum.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shinn|first1=Earl|title=The World's Art: From the International Exhibition|date=1880|publisher=Lovering|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=S6tBAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His paintings represented Britain at the great [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Paris Exhibition]].\n\nLeighton was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] in 1878,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=24651 |date=29 November 1878 |page=6695}}</ref> and was created a baronet, of Holland Park Road in the Parish of [[St Mary Abbots]], Kensington, in the County of Middlesex, eight years later.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=25551 |date=22 January 1886 |page=328 }}</ref> He was the first painter to be given a [[peerage]], in the [[1896 New Year Honours]].

Enquiry is furthermore hindered by the fact that Leighton left no diaries and his letters are telling in their lack of reference to his personal circumstances. No definite primary evidence has yet come to light that effectively dispels the secrecy that Leighton built up around himself, although it is clear that he did court a circle of younger men around his artistic studio.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOn his death his [[baron]]y was extinguished after existing for only a day; this is a record in the [[Peerage]]. His house in [[Holland Park]], London has been turned into a museum, the [[Leighton House Museum]]. It contains many of his drawings and paintings, as well as some of his former art collection including works by [[Old Masters]] and his contemporaries such as a painting dedicated to Leighton by [[Sir John Everett Millais]]. The house also features many of Leighton's inspirations, including his collection of Iznik tiles. Its centrepiece is the magnificent Arab Hall.

In studying Collette's typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, \"[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.\" She also wrote that Collette makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like ''Miss You Already'' and ''Lucky Them''.

Kingston took note of Collette's use of physicality to convey her characters' emotions as in ''Emma'' and ''United States of Tara''. She remarked that Collette's acting method references the components of [[Stanislavski's system|Stanislavski\u2019s System of Acting]]. In studying Collette's typecasting as mothers, Kingston wrote, \"[Collette] selectively chooses roles of women and mothers which she can portray in ways that are multidimensional and different from another.\" She also wrote that Collette makes conscious efforts to break from the typecasting, with leading roles in films like ''Miss You Already'' and ''Lucky Them''. At the end of her analysis, Kingston concluded, \"Collette truly is a chameleon in both the versatility of her acting style and in the kind of roles she is willing to approach with a physicality-based method.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcgillchannelundergraduatereview.com/2018/04/toni-collette-character-as-craft/|title=Toni Collette: Character as Craft \u2013 The Channel|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n[[File:Toni Collette by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|236x236px|Collette at the 2015 [[San Diego Comic-Con|San Diego Comic Con]] promoting [[Krampus (film)|''Krampus'']] (2015)|alt=]]\n\nIn her twenties she found it difficult to adapt to being in the media spotlight and, as a result, struggled with [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]] and [[panic attack]]s.<ref name=\":1\" /> During this period she travelled extensively, shaved her head five times and bought a flat in [[Brixton]], London.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |access-date=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archive-date= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\n\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

[[World Health Organization]] reports that the clinical picture in severe cases is strikingly different from the disease pattern seen during epidemics of seasonal influenza. While people with certain underlying medical conditions are known to be at increased risk, many severe cases occur in previously healthy people. In severe cases, patients generally begin to deteriorate around three to five days after symptom onset. Deterioration is rapid, with many patients progressing to respiratory failure within 24 hours, requiring immediate admission to an intensive care unit. Upon admission, most patients need immediate respiratory support with [[mechanical ventilation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html|title=Clinical features of severe cases of pandemic influenza|date=16 October 2009|work=Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 13|publisher=[[World Health Organization]] (WHO) |access-date=17 January 2010|location=Geneva, Switzerland| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119214956/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/notes/h1n1_clinical_features_20091016/en/index.html| archive-date= 19 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n===Complications===\n\nMost complications have occurred among previously unhealthy individuals, with [[obesity]] and [[respiratory disease]] as the strongest risk factors.

Secondary [[bacterial pneumonia|bacterial infection]] is more common in children.

The effectiveness was based on European and Asian studies and expert opinion. The delay in vaccine administration demonstrated the shortcomings of the world's capacity for vaccine-production, as well as problems with international distribution.

A case-study of the preparation, planning, mitigation, and response efforts during the fall of 2009 is that of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)which took several steps to increase the emergency department(ED) surge capacity response. CHOP used portions of the main lobby area as an ED waiting room; several of the region's hospital-based outpatient facilities were in use during evening and weekend hours for non-emergency cases; the ED's 24-hour short-stay unit was utilized to care for ED patients in a longer-term capacity; non-board certified physicians (in pediatric emergency medicine) and inpatient-unit medical nurses were utilized for ED patient care; hospital units normally utilized for other medical or therapeutic purposes were transformed into ED patient rooms; and rooms normally used for only one patient were expanded to at least a capacity of 2.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scarfone RJ, Coffin S, Fieldston ES, Falkowski G, Cooney MG, Grenfell S | title = Hospital-based pandemic influenza preparedness and response: strategies to increase surge capacity | journal = Pediatric Emergency Care | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 565\u201372 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21642799 | doi = 10.1097/PEC.0b013e31821dc9d1 }}</ref>\n\n==Comparisons to other pandemics and epidemics==\n\n{{Update section|date=March 2020|reason=This section needs to reflect how the 2009 flu pandemic compares to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]}}\nAnnual influenza epidemics are estimated to affect 5\u201315% of the global population.

[[Robert Gauthiot]], (the first Buddhist Sogdian scholar) and [[Paul Pelliot]], (who while exploring in [[Dunhuang]], retrieved Sogdian material) began investigating the Sogdian material that Pelliot had discovered. Gauthiot published many articles based on his work with Pelliot's material, but died during the First World War. One of Gauthiot's most impressive articles was a glossary to the Sogdian text, which he was in the process of completing when he died. This work was continued by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] after Gauthiot's death.<ref name=Utz>Utz, David. (1978). ''Survey of Buddhist Sogdian studies.'' Tokyo: The Reiyukai Library.</ref>\n\nVarious Sogdian pieces have been found in the Turfan text corpus by the [[German Turfan expeditions]]. These expeditions were controlled by the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref name=Utz /> These pieces consist almost entirely of religious works by Manichaean and Christian writers, including [[Bible translations into Sogdian|translations of the Bible]]. Most of the Sogdian religious works are from the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref name=iranian>''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293577/Iranian-languages/74634/The-Middle-Iranian-stage#ref=603453 \"Iranian Languages\"]''(2009). [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-09</ref>\n\nDunhuang and Turfan were the two most plentiful sites of Manichean, Buddhist, and Christian Sogdian texts. Sogdiana itself actually contained a much smaller collection of texts. These texts were business related, belonging to a minor Sogdian king, [[Divashtich]]. These business texts dated back to the time of the Muslim conquest, about 700.<ref name=iranian />\n\n==Writing system==\nLike all the writing systems employed for Middle Iranian languages, the [[Sogdian alphabet]] ultimately derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet]]. Like its close relatives, the [[Pahlavi scripts]], written Sogdian contains many [[logogram]]s or [[ideogram]]s, which were Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones. The Sogdian script is the direct ancestor of the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]], itself the forerunner of the [[Traditional Mongolian alphabet]].\n\nAs in other writing systems descended from the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], there are no special signs for vowels. As in the parent Aramaic system, the consonantal signs \u2019 y w can be used as [[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] for the long vowels [a: i: u:] respectively. However, unlike it, these consonant signs would also sometimes serve to express the short vowels (which could also sometimes be left unexpressed, as they ''always'' are in the parent systems).<ref name=clauson/> To distinguish long vowels from short ones, an additional aleph could be written before the sign denoting the long vowel.<ref name=clauson>Clauson, Gerard. 2002. Studies in Turkic and Mongolic linguistics. P.103-104.</ref>\n\nThe Sogdian language also used the [[Manichaean alphabet]], which consisted of 29 letters.<ref>Gershevitch, Ilya. (1954). ''A Grammar of Manichean Sogdian.'' p.1. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref>\n\nIn transcribing Sogdian script into Roman letters, Aramaic ideograms are often noted by means of capitals.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\n\n====Light stems====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Robert Gauthiot]], (the first Buddhist Sogdian scholar) and [[Paul Pelliot]], (who while exploring in [[Dunhuang]], retrieved Sogdian material) began investigating the Sogdian material that Pelliot had discovered. Gauthiot published many articles based on his work with Pelliot's material, but died during the First World War. One of Gauthiot's most impressive articles was a glossary to the Sogdian text, which he was in the process of completing when he died. This work was continued by [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] after Gauthiot's death.<ref name=Utz>Utz, David. (1978). ''Survey of Buddhist Sogdian studies.'' Tokyo: The Reiyukai Library.</ref>\n\nVarious Sogdian pieces have been found in the Turfan text corpus by the [[German Turfan expeditions]]. These expeditions were controlled by the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].<ref name=Utz /> These pieces consist almost entirely of religious works by Manichaean and Christian writers, including [[Bible translations into Sogdian|translations of the Bible]]. Most of the Sogdian religious works are from the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref name=iranian>''[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/293577/Iranian-languages/74634/The-Middle-Iranian-stage#ref=603453 \"Iranian Languages\"]''(2009).

Sogdiana itself actually contained a much smaller collection of texts. These texts were business related, belonging to a minor Sogdian king, [[Divashtich]]. These business texts dated back to the time of the Muslim conquest, about 700.<ref name=iranian />\n\n==Writing system==\nLike all the writing systems employed for Middle Iranian languages, the [[Sogdian alphabet]] ultimately derives from the [[Aramaic alphabet]]. Like its close relatives, the [[Pahlavi scripts]], written Sogdian contains many [[logogram]]s or [[ideogram]]s, which were Aramaic words written to represent native spoken ones. The Sogdian script is the direct ancestor of the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]], itself the forerunner of the [[Traditional Mongolian alphabet]].\n\nAs in other writing systems descended from the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]], there are no special signs for vowels. As in the parent Aramaic system, the consonantal signs \u2019 y w can be used as [[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]] for the long vowels [a: i: u:] respectively. However, unlike it, these consonant signs would also sometimes serve to express the short vowels (which could also sometimes be left unexpressed, as they ''always'' are in the parent systems).<ref name=clauson/> To distinguish long vowels from short ones, an additional aleph could be written before the sign denoting the long vowel.<ref name=clauson>Clauson, Gerard. 2002. Studies in Turkic and Mongolic linguistics. P.103-104.</ref>\n\nThe Sogdian language also used the [[Manichaean alphabet]], which consisted of 29 letters.<ref>Gershevitch, Ilya. (1954). ''A Grammar of Manichean Sogdian.'' p.1. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref>\n\nIn transcribing Sogdian script into Roman letters, Aramaic ideograms are often noted by means of capitals.\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\n\n====Light stems====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action.

He has written newspaper articles and autobiographical, historical and fictional books. \n\nHe was born in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in the United States, to Canadian parents, and immigrated to Canada.  He graduated from [[Macdonald Campus|Macdonald Agricultural College]] of [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]] [[Quebec]] in 1956. \n\n== Career ==\nLowell Green started his radio broadcasting career in [[Brantford]], Ontario, and subsequently moved to radio stations in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] Ontario and [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal Quebec]].  Green arrived in Ottawa at CFRA in 1960 as a news and [[farm]] reporter.  In 1966, he began hosting ''Greenline'', and eventually became the longest-running open-line talk show host in [[North America]]. He retired briefly from radio in the 1980s, but returned in 1990.  Two of his historic broadcasts are being preserved at [[Library and Archives Canada]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Green|first=Lowell|url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Death_in_October.html?id=vDEJuHHU0GUC&redir_esc=y|title=Death in October|date=|publisher=eBookIt.com|year=|isbn=978-1-4566-1102-6|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he returned to CFRA and hosted ''The Lowell Green Show'' until his official retirement on 4 January 2016.

There were so many bottles and containers of polluted water that [[Canada Post]] objected and did not want to deliver them all.  According to Green, the uproar led to the creation of the [[Rideau Valley Conservation Authority]] and the clean-up of both the Rideau River and the [[Ottawa River]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWith the creation of the S''ave The Centennial Flame'' Campaign, a month of relentless broadcasts, and over three-thousand petitions from his loyal audience which he affectionately called \"The CFRA Nation\", the [[Centennial Flame]] was preserved and has continued to shine brightly on  [[Parliament Hill]] since 1967.<ref name=\":1\" />   \n\nTogether with his listeners, he has helped promote and organize the [[Unity Rally|''Unity Rally'']], a  political rally encouraging Quebecers to vote \"No\" during the [[1995 Quebec referendum|1995 Quebec Independence referendum]] held in [[Place du Canada]] in Montreal Quebec.<ref name=\":0\">[[Talk:Lowell Green#your lowell green story is badly outdated and totally negative.|Lowell Green:Talk | Lowell Green responds on 16 October 2017]]</ref>  In 1975, after the tragic school shooting that occurred at the [[St. Pius X High School (Ottawa)|St. Pius X High School]] in Ottawa, Lowell Green and thousands of his supporters joined his ''Fire Arms Safety Association'' which successfully lobbied and convinced [[Parliament of Canada|Members of Parliament]] and [[Senate of Canada|Senators]] to introduce and pass gun law legislation in Canada.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nAlong with the [[Operation Come Home|Reverend Norman Johnston]], he founded the Ottawa chapter of the [[Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada|''Big Brothers'']]'','' was founder of the ''Help Santa Toy Parade'' in Ottawa, has contributed to ongoing efforts to help modernize and renovate the ''Saint Vincent Hospital'' and ''\u00c9lisabeth Bruy\u00e8re Hospital'' in Ottawa.
