Amid its many [[Architecture of the California Missions|Mission Style]] academic and residential buildings are the historic mission gardens, rose garden, and palm trees. The campus benefits from the area's [[mediterranean climate]], with more than 300 days of sun a year.\n\nUntil 1939, the law school inhabited present-day St. Joseph's Hall at the center of campus. Under the tenure of Dean Edwin Owens, Bergin Hall was constructed and became home to the school in 1939. The new building was built using monies collected through Santa Clara football's successful appearances in the [[Sugar Bowl]] and named after [[Thomas Bergin]], Santa Clara's first graduate, a California legal pioneer, and an early donor to the School of Law.\n\nThe Edwin Heafey Law Library was constructed in 1963, and expanded in 1973 to include more space for library materials.  Heafey was renovated and expanded again in 1988.  The collection contains over 400,000 volumes in print and digital formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/library/about-the-library/|title=About the Library - Santa Clara Law|website=law.scu.edu}}</ref>  Additionally, the library manages an [[institutional repository]] which currently contains over 4,000 digital items including a collection of papers related to the Congressional hearings regarding the [[Watergate Scandal]] donated by Congressman [[Don Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/watergate/|title=This series is a collection of papers produced during the Watergate Hearings that were donated by Congressman Don Edwards to the Heafey Law Library. - Law Library Collections - Santa Clara Law|website=digitalcommons.law.scu.edu}}</ref>  Other digital collections include documents relating to litigation over the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act]] (also known as [[Obamacare]]) and the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/communities.html|title=Browse by Collection or Center - Santa Clara University School of Law Digital Commons|website=digitalcommons.law.scu.edu}}</ref>\n[[File:Charney Hall Law Library .jpg|thumb|Charney Hall - Law Library Reference Desk]]\nAlso in 1973, Bannan Hall was built, including space for the Law School on the ground floor.  In 2008 Dean [[Donald Polden]] announced the law school would have exclusive use of Bannan Hall, and the building was renovated and used exclusively by the law school shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 2018, the Law school moved into Charney Hall, a new $60 million building built specifically to house the Law school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/about-us-a-bold-vision/strategic-priorities/charney-hall/|title=Charney Hall {{!}} Santa Clara Law|website=law.scu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>  The 96,000-square-foot building is a vast improvement over the school's existing facilities, which are spread over very different buildings, one of which was built a century ago.

Amid its many [[Architecture of the California Missions|Mission Style]] academic and residential buildings are the historic mission gardens, rose garden, and palm trees. The campus benefits from the area's [[mediterranean climate]], with more than 300 days of sun a year.\n\nUntil 1939, the law school inhabited present-day St. Joseph's Hall at the center of campus. Under the tenure of Dean Edwin Owens, Bergin Hall was constructed and became home to the school in 1939. The new building was built using monies collected through Santa Clara football's successful appearances in the [[Sugar Bowl]] and named after [[Thomas Bergin]], Santa Clara's first graduate, a California legal pioneer, and an early donor to the School of Law.\n\nThe Edwin Heafey Law Library was constructed in 1963, and expanded in 1973 to include more space for library materials.  Heafey was renovated and expanded again in 1988.  The collection contains over 400,000 volumes in print and digital formats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/library/about-the-library/|title=About the Library - Santa Clara Law|website=law.scu.edu}}</ref>  Additionally, the library manages an [[institutional repository]] which currently contains over 4,000 digital items including a collection of papers related to the Congressional hearings regarding the [[Watergate Scandal]] donated by Congressman [[Don Edwards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/watergate/|title=This series is a collection of papers produced during the Watergate Hearings that were donated by Congressman Don Edwards to the Heafey Law Library. - Law Library Collections - Santa Clara Law|website=digitalcommons.law.scu.edu}}</ref>  Other digital collections include documents relating to litigation over the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act]] (also known as [[Obamacare]]) and the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/communities.html|title=Browse by Collection or Center - Santa Clara University School of Law Digital Commons|website=digitalcommons.law.scu.edu}}</ref>\n[[File:Charney Hall Law Library .jpg|thumb|Charney Hall - Law Library Reference Desk]]\nAlso in 1973, Bannan Hall was built, including space for the Law School on the ground floor.  In 2008 Dean [[Donald Polden]] announced the law school would have exclusive use of Bannan Hall, and the building was renovated and used exclusively by the law school shortly thereafter.\n\nIn 2018, the Law school moved into Charney Hall, a new $60 million building built specifically to house the Law school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law.scu.edu/about-us-a-bold-vision/strategic-priorities/charney-hall/|title=Charney Hall {{!}} Santa Clara Law|website=law.scu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref>  The 96,000-square-foot building is a vast improvement over the school's existing facilities, which are spread over very different buildings, one of which was built a century ago.

This move by China caught India by surprise and by 12 October, Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India in both the North-West and North-Eastern parts of the border and captured vast portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate, however India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no peaceful agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked diplomatic claim over. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders and, its political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks & Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the Government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was also targeted at the incompetence of then-Defence Minister, [[Krishna Menon]] who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the disastrous Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter offensive on Pakistan. Pakistan launched [[Operation Grand Slam]] in reply on 1 September, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive throughout its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.\n[[File:1965 Indo-Pak War DestroyedShermanTank.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army officer next to a destroyed Pakistani Sherman tank, after the battle of ''Asal Uttar.'']]\nInitially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector. After launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan, India was able to capture three important mountain positions in Kashmir. By 9 September, the Indian Army had made considerable in-roads into Pakistan.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital [[Srinagar]]-[[Leh]] Highway ([[National Highway 1 (India)|NH 1A]]), [[Batalik]] and [[Dras]].\n[[File:KWM.jpg|thumb|Kargil War Memorial looking at National Highway 1 from the foot of Tololing]]\n\nOnce the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops and [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] was launched. However, since the heights were under Pakistani control, India was at a clear strategic disadvantage. From their [[observation post]]s, the Pakistani forces had a clear line-of-sight to lay down [[indirect fire|indirect artillery fire]] on NH 1A, inflicting heavy casualties on the Indians.<ref name=\"NLI\">[http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 Indian general praises Pakistani valour at Kargil] 5 May 2003 Daily Times, Pakistan {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116123416/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_5-5-2003_pg7_14 |date=16 January 2009 }}</ref> This was a serious problem for the Indian Army as the highway was its main logistical and supply route.<ref>Kashmir in the Shadow of War By Robert Wirsing Published by M.E.

Once the NH 1A area was cleared, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control. The [[Battle of Tololing]], among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. Nevertheless, some posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully under way, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range. The Indian Army mounted some direct frontal ground assaults which were slow and took a heavy toll given the steep ascent that had to be made on peaks as high as {{convert|18000|ft|m}}.

Exercise Shakti is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations and drills in snowbound and mountainous areas. The second joint military exercise between the two countries was held in September 2013 with the first one being held in India in October 2011. The theme of the exercise is to conduct platoon level joint counter insurgency operations in high altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries about global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other's military procedures thus increasing the scope for interoperability and better responsiveness to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with the French Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |title=Indo-French joint Army exercise Shakti 2013 begins today |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706090958/http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |title=Indo-French Joint Army Exercise \"Shakti 2016\" |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018110057/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Shoorveer'''\n\nOn first week of April 2012 the Indian Army launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery guns and infantry combat vehicles as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named \"Shoorveer\", was being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command and ended in the first week of May. This was the largest ever exercise conducted by Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with honing of basic battle procedures and tactical drills at a tactical level.\n\nA number of field firings were carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of the weapon systems. Many innovations and modifications carried out by units and formations to enhance combat power were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increased combat tempo to set the stage for a major joint army-air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |title=Indian Army gears up for war game in Rajasthan desert |publisher=FacenFacts |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605123334/http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Rudra Akrosh'''\n\nIn May 2012 the Indian army started testing the preparedness level of its units and to validate new age technology, battle concepts, organizational structures and networked operations. The Western Army Command conducted its summer training exercises in Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir. Code named Exercise Rudra Akrosh, the war games were aimed at validating the operational and transformational effectiveness of various formations under the Western Army Command. The exercise which entered its culmination phase was also witnessed by Western Army Commander Lt General S R Ghosh. It included various summer training manoeuvres where approximately 20,000 troops tested battle skills with state-of-the-art weapons systems in complete integration with the fighter and transport aircraft provided by the Indian Air Force. Besides interacting with the soldiers and officers co-ordinating the war games, Lt Gen Ghosh witnessed various battle manoeuvres by infantry troops, mechanised infantry, tanks, artillery, Heli-borne troops and surveillance equipment. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and attack helicopters were also co-opted in the operational scenario. Recently, the Jaipur-based South Western Command&mdash;also known as Sapta Shakti command&mdash;conducted its summer war games with more than 50,000 troops, latest weaponry and air assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises, IBN Live News |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928032748/http://ibnlive.in.com/generalnewsfeed/news/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises/997533.html |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}{{dead link|date=April 2016|reason=failed bot fix, 28 February}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/western-army-command-conducts-summer-training-exercises-112051100459_1.html |title=Western Army Command conducts summer training exercises |date=2012-05-11 |work=Business Standard India |access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Nomadic Elephant'''\n\nThe Indian Army has been conducting training exercises with the [[Mongolian Army]].

However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]].\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With the role of India increasing, and the requirement for protection of India's interests in far-off countries become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=2018-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=2017-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC - Kashmir News Zone|date=2017-12-15|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

These include the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's Army\", it is formed of two Regiments; [[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]] and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all. The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji|Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji, PVSM]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability. Thus, the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance. As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile. The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2018 2.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Indian Army soldier during a training exercise.]]\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on the basis of region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence. Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]] and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the union of India as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region, caste/community or religion, such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

Post independence, the corps has participated in all the [[wars involving India]], starting from the [[1947 Indo-Pakistani War]] to the [[1999 Kargil conflict]]. The corps enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery from the Army's artillery regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.\n\n'''Para (Special Forces)'''\n\n[[Para (Special Forces)]], commonly known as '''Para SF''', is the [[special operations]] unit of Indian Army.

The MI (as it is commonly referred to) was constituted in 1941 and was initially created to check corruption in the Army's own ranks. With time, its role has evolved into cross border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups and counter-terrorism. In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]] wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime Intelligence organisation of the Indian Army. {{as of|2012}}, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created [[National Technical Research Organisation]] and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |title=How Indian Army's Military Intelligence Directorate works : Special Report&nbsp;\u2013 India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031141954/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier apex scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's Office,  it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of its kind in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|title=State govt allots land for NTRO in Borda village|work=IBNLive|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235147/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Field formations===\nBelow are the basic field formations of the Indian Army:\n\n*[[Command (military formation)|Command]]: Indian Army has six operational commands and one training command.

Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned up flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe forces of the [[East India Company]] in India were forced by casualties to dye their white summer [[tunic]]s to neutral tones, initially a tan called [[khaki]] (from the [[Hindi]] word for \"dusty\"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on [[dun]] for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]].

The [[Nizam of Hyderabad|Nizam]], refused to accede his state to the Union of India. The following stand-off between the [[Government of India]] and the Nizam ended on 12 September 1948 when India's then deputy Prime Minister [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]] ordered Indian troops to secure the [[Hyderabad State|state]]. During five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an [[Indian Air Force]] squadron of [[Hawker Tempest|Hawker Tempest aircraft]], routed the Hyderabad State forces. Five Indian Army infantry battalions and one armoured squadron were engaged in the operation. The following day, the State of Hyderabad was proclaimed as a part of the [[Union of India]]. Major General [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]], who led the [[Operation Polo]] and accepted the surrender of the Nizam's forces on 18 September 1948, was appointed the military governor of Hyderabad (1948\u20131949) to restore law and order.\n\n'''Medical assistance during Korean War (1950\u20131953)'''\n\n{{main|Korean War}}\nDuring the Korean War, India sent the 60th Indian (Parachute) Field Ambulance unit to aid the UN troops fighting against the Chinese and North Korean invasion of South Korea, though they decided against sending combat forces. The 60th PFA was included in the [[1st Commonwealth Division]]. In the aftermath of the war, an Indian infantry brigade formed the Custodian Force of India as some of the soldiers were also sent to Korea as part of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee to assist in the exchange of prisoners of war.

A small contingent of its troops entered Goa, Daman, and Diu to capture and secure the territory. After a brief conflict, in which 31 Portuguese soldiers were killed, the [[Portuguese Navy]] frigate [[NRP Afonso de Albuquerque]] destroyed, and over 3,000 Portuguese captured, Portuguese General [[Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Vassalo e Silva]] surrendered to Maj Gen KP Candeth (Kunhiraman Palat Kandoth) of the Indian Army, after twenty-six hours.

Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to Kashmir, and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\nSmall-scale clashes between Indian and Chinese forces broke out as India insisted on the disputed [[McMahon Line]] being regarded as the international border between the two countries. Chinese troops claimed not to have retaliated to the cross-border firing by Indian troops, despite sustaining losses.<ref>Bruce Bueno de Mesquita & David Lalman.

Meanwhile, Chinese troops had also made incursions into Indian-held territory, and tensions between the two reached a new high when Indian forces discovered a road constructed by China in [[Aksai Chin]]. After a series of failed negotiations, the [[People's Liberation Army]] attacked Indian Army positions at the Thag La ridge. This move by China caught India by surprise and by 12 October, Nehru gave orders for the Chinese to be expelled from Aksai Chin. However, poor co-ordination among various divisions of the Indian Army, and the late decision to mobilise the Indian Air Force in vast numbers, gave China a crucial tactical and strategic advantage over India. On 20 October, Chinese soldiers attacked India in both the North-West and North-Eastern parts of the border and captured vast portions of Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nAs the fighting moved beyond disputed territories, China called on the Indian government to negotiate, however India remained determined to regain lost territory. With no peaceful agreement in sight, China unilaterally withdrew its forces from Arunachal Pradesh. The reasons for the withdrawal are disputed with India claiming various logistical problems for China and diplomatic support from the United States, while China stated that it still held territory it had staked diplomatic claim over. The dividing line between the Indian and Chinese forces was named the [[Line of Actual Control]].\n\nThe poor decisions made by India's military commanders and, its political leadership, raised several questions. The [[Henderson-Brooks Report|Henderson-Brooks & Bhagat committee]] was soon set up by the Government of India to determine the causes of the poor performance of the Indian Army. Its report criticised the decision not to allow the Indian Air Force to target Chinese transport lines out of fear of a Chinese aerial counter-attack on Indian civilian areas. Much of the blame was also targeted at the incompetence of then-Defence Minister, [[Krishna Menon]] who resigned from his post soon after the war ended. Despite frequent calls for its release, the Henderson-Brooks report still remains classified.<ref>Claude Arpi. ''India and her neighbourhood: a French observer's views''.

Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was still recovering from the disastrous Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and launched a counter offensive on Pakistan. Pakistan launched [[Operation Grand Slam]] in reply on 1 September, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive throughout its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.\n[[File:1965 Indo-Pak War DestroyedShermanTank.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army officer next to a destroyed Pakistani Sherman tank, after the battle of ''Asal Uttar.'']]\nInitially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern sector.

Diplomatic tensions eased after the [[Lahore Summit]] was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism was short-lived since in mid-1999 Pakistani paramilitary forces and Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan heights in the [[Kargil district]] of India. These had been vacated by the Indian army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were supposed to be reoccupied in spring. The regular Pakistani troops who took control of these areas received important support, both in the form of arms and supplies, from Pakistan. Some of the heights under their control, which also included the Tiger Hill, overlooked the vital [[Srinagar]]-[[Leh]] Highway ([[National Highway 1 (India)|NH 1A]]), [[Batalik]] and [[Dras]].\n[[File:KWM.jpg|thumb|Kargil War Memorial looking at National Highway 1 from the foot of Tololing]]\n\nOnce the scale of the Pakistani incursion was realised, the Indian Army quickly mobilised about 200,000 troops and [[Operation Vijay (1999)|Operation Vijay]] was launched.

The [[Battle of Tololing]], among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. Nevertheless, some posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. As the operation was fully under way, about 250 artillery guns were brought in to clear the infiltrators in the posts that were in the [[Sightline|line-of-sight]]. At many vital points, neither artillery nor air power could dislodge the outposts manned by the Pakistan soldiers, who were out of visible range.

Exercise Shakti is conducted to practice and validate anti-terrorist operations and drills in snowbound and mountainous areas. The second joint military exercise between the two countries was held in September 2013 with the first one being held in India in October 2011. The theme of the exercise is to conduct platoon level joint counter insurgency operations in high altitude mountainous terrain under the UN Charter, thus emphasising the shared concerns of both countries about global terrorism. An added aim of the exercise is to qualitatively enhance knowledge of each other's military procedures thus increasing the scope for interoperability and better responsiveness to a common threat. The twelve-day exercise with the French Army is scheduled to be conducted in multiple modules in order to achieve complete integration between the two contingents at every stage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |title=Indo-French joint Army exercise Shakti 2013 begins today |publisher=Zeenews.india.com |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706090958/http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/indo-french-joint-army-exercise-shakti-2013-begins-today_875147.html |archivedate=6 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |title=Indo-French Joint Army Exercise \"Shakti 2016\" |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=11 August 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018110057/https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.161880577341913.1073741956.123788044484500&type=1 |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Shoorveer'''\n\nOn first week of April 2012 the Indian Army launched a massive summer exercise in the Rajasthan desert involving over 50,000 troops and several hundred artillery guns and infantry combat vehicles as part of its efforts to shore up its battle worthiness on the western front with Pakistan. The exercise, code-named \"Shoorveer\", was being conducted by the Jaipur-based South Western Command and ended in the first week of May. This was the largest ever exercise conducted by Indian army since 1947. The collective training started with honing of basic battle procedures and tactical drills at a tactical level.\n\nA number of field firings were carried out to check the accuracy and lethality of the weapon systems. Many innovations and modifications carried out by units and formations to enhance combat power were tested in the field. The troops built on the training momentum gradually, with increased combat tempo to set the stage for a major joint army-air force exercise in the later part of the exercise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |title=Indian Army gears up for war game in Rajasthan desert |publisher=FacenFacts |date=25 April 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605123334/http://www.facenfacts.com/NewsDetails/24655/indian-army-gears-up-for-war-game-in-rajasthan-desert.htm |archivedate=5 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Exercise Rudra Akrosh'''\n\nIn May 2012 the Indian army started testing the preparedness level of its units and to validate new age technology, battle concepts, organizational structures and networked operations.

However, over the years, the army has also taken up the responsibility of providing internal security, especially against insurgencies in [[Kashmir]] and the [[Northeast India|Northeast]].\nThe current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations attack at a point of Indian choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote several corps to the strike role. Currently, the army is also looking at enhancing its [[special forces]] capabilities. With the role of India increasing, and the requirement for protection of India's interests in far-off countries become important, the Indian Army and Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine brigade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |title=Army and navy plan to set up a marine brigade |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=9 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019211335/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/100770/India/army-and-navy-plan-to-set-up-a-marine-brigade.html |archivedate=19 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2017}}\n\n==Organisation==\n{{Main|List of serving generals of the Indian Army}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Principal Staff Officers at Headquarters, Indian Army \n!Post\n!Current Holder\n|- \n|[[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] \n|General [[Manoj Mukund Naravane]], PVSM, AVSM, SM, VSM, ADC\n|- \n|[[Vice Chief of Army Staff (India)|Vice Chief of Army Staff]]\n|Lieutenant General [[Satinder Kumar Saini]] AVSM,YSM,VSM\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Information Systems & Training)\n|\n|- \n|Deputy Chief of Army Staff  (Planning & Systems) \n|Lieutenant General Sudharshan Shrikant Hasabnis<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|title='Make in India' not just confined to India anymore, benefitting others: Jitendra Singh|work=Outlook|access-date=2018-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910094634/https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/make-in-india-not-just-confined-to-india-anymore-benefitting-others-jitendra-singh/1378556|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Adjutant-General (India)|Adjutant General]] \n|Lieutenant General Ashwani Kumar, AVSM<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|title=Official Website of Indian Army|website=uniindia.com|accessdate=2017-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707115430/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html==|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|title=Lt General Ashwani Kumar assumes charge as Adjutant General|access-date=12 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202223736/http://www.uniindia.com/lt-general-ashwani-kumar-assumes-charge-as-adjutant-general/india/news/923811.html|archive-date=2 December 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Military Secretary (India)|Military Secretary]] \n|Lieutenant General [[Jaswinder Singh Sandhu (general)|Jaswinder Singh Sandhu]], UYSM, AVSM, VSM<ref name=\"Kashmir News Zone\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|title=Lt Gen A K Bhatt to take over as 15 Corps GOC - Kashmir News Zone|date=2017-12-15|work=Kashmir News Zone|access-date=2017-12-29|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180816105614/http://www.kashmirnewszone.com/lt-gen-k-bhatt-take-15-corps-goc/|archive-date=16 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Master-General of the Ordnance|Master General of Ordnance]] \n|Lieutenant General S K Upadhya<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projectyourstate.com/index.php/Home/display/Lt-Gen-S-K-Upadhyay-designated-as-MGO|title=Lt Gen S K Upadhyay designated as MGO|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|- \n|[[Indian Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer-in-Chief]] \n|Lieutenant General [[S.

These include the following historic regiments dating back to the nineteenth century or earlier: [[1st Duke of York's Own Skinner's Horse|1st (Skinner's) Horse]], the [[2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse)]], the [[3rd Cavalry (India)|3rd Cavalry]], the [[4th Duke of Cambridge's Own Hodson's Horse|4th (Hodson's) Horse]], the [[7th Light Cavalry]], the [[8th King George's Own Light Cavalry|8th Light Cavalry]], the [[9th Royal Deccan Horse|9th (Deccan) Horse]], the [[14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse|14th (Scinde) Horse]], the [[The Poona Horse|17th (Poona) Horse]], the [[15th Lancers]], the [[16th Light Cavalry]], the [[18th Cavalry]], the 20th Lancers and the [[The Central India Horse (21st King George V's Own Horse)|21st (Central India) Horse]]. A substantial number of additional units designated as either \"Cavalry\" or \"Armoured\" Regiments have been raised since Independence.\n\n'''[[Mechanised infantry|Mechanised Infantry]]'''\n\nThe Mechanised Infantry is the newest Combat Arm of the Indian Army. Often referred to as \"tomorrow's arm in today's Army\", it is formed of two Regiments; [[Brigade of the Guards#Regimental Battalions|The Brigade of the Guards]] and [[Mechanised Infantry Regiment]] and comprises 48 Mechanised Infantry Battalions in all. The brain-child of raising of this arm was that of [[Krishnaswamy Sundarji|Gen Krishnaswamy Sundarji, PVSM]] (28 April 1930 \u2013 8 February 1999), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army from 1986 to 1988. During the late 70s, as part of Indian Army modernisation, there was an urgent need to re-calibrate the Indian Mechanised Forces by forming of Mechanised Infantry units to further the shock-action, fire-power, flexibility and mobility of Armoured formations to include ground-holding ability. Thus, the Mechanised Infantry Regiment was born by careful selection of existing Infantry battalions based on operational performance. As the need for more Mechanised battalions grew, the elite Brigade of The Guards were also converted to the Mechanised profile. The two Regiments along with the Armoured Corps form part of the Indian Army's elite \"Mechanised Forces\".\n\n'''Infantry'''\n[[File:Yudh Abhyas 2018 2.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Indian Army soldier during a training exercise.]]\nUpon its inception, the Indian Army inherited the British Army's organisational structure, which is still maintained today. Therefore, like its predecessor, an Indian infantry regiment's responsibility is not to undertake field operations but to provide battalions and well trained personnel to the field formations. As such it is common to find battalions of the same regiment spread across several brigades, divisions, corps, commands, and even theatres. Like its British and Commonwealth counterparts, troops enlisted within the regiment are immensely loyal, take great pride in the regiment to which they are assigned, and generally spend their entire career within the regiment.\n\nMost Indian Army infantry regiments recruit based on certain selection criteria, such as on the basis of region (for example, the [[Assam Regiment]]), caste/community ([[Jat Regiment]]), or religion ([[Sikh Regiment]]). Most regiments continue the heritage of regiments raised under the British Raj, but some have been raised after independence. Some regiments raised after independence have specialised in border defence, in particular the [[Ladakh Scouts]], the [[Arunachal Scouts]] and the [[Sikkim Scouts]].\n[[File:Indian Army Gurkha rifles.jpg|alt=|thumb|Indian Army Gorkha Rifles troopers, during a combat simulation in Fort Irwin, California.]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Rajput regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Rajput Regiment]] during a [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day Parade]]]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Sikh Light Infantry regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n[[File:Indian Army-Madras regiment.jpeg|right|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Madras Regiment]] during a Republic Day Parade]]\n\nOver the years there have been fears that troops' allegiance lay more with their regiments and the regions/castes/communities/religions from which they were recruited, as opposed to the union of India as a whole. Thus some \"all India\" or \"all class\" regiments have been created that recruit troops from all over India regardless of region, caste/community or religion, such as the [[Brigade of the Guards]] (which later converted to the Mechanised Infantry profile) and the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Infantry regiments in the Indian Army<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |title=Infantry Regiments |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007164813/http://bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Infantry.html?layout=default |archivedate=7 October 2013 }}</ref>\n!Regiment\n!Regimental Center\n!Raised\n|-\n|[[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]\n|[[Bangalore]], [[Karnataka]]\n|1945\n|-\n\n|[[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]]\n|[[Ramgarh Cantonment]], [[Jharkhand]]\n|1761\n|-\n|[[Madras Regiment]]\n|[[Wellington Cantonment]], [[Tamil Nadu]]\n|1758\n|-\n|[[The Grenadiers]]\n|[[Jabalpur]], [[Madhya Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Maratha Light Infantry]]\n|[[Belgaum]], Karnataka\n|1768\n|-\n|[[Rajputana Rifles]]\n|[[Delhi Cantonment]], [[New Delhi]]\n|1775\n|-\n|[[Rajput Regiment]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], [[Uttar Pradesh]]\n|1778\n|-\n|[[Jat Regiment]]\n|[[Bareilly]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1795\n|-\n|[[Sikh Regiment]]\n|Ramgarh Cantonment, Jharkhand\n|1846\n|-\n|[[Sikh Light Infantry]]\n|[[Fatehgarh]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[Dogra Regiment]]\n|[[Faizabad]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1877\n|-\n|[[Garhwal Rifles]]\n|[[Lansdowne, India|Lansdowne]], [[Uttarakhand]]\n|1887\n|-\n|[[Kumaon Regiment]]\n|[[Ranikhet]], Uttarakhand\n|1813\n|-\n|[[Assam Regiment]]\n|[[Shillong]], [[Meghalaya]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Bihar Regiment]]\n|[[Danapur Cantonment]], [[Bihar]]\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Mahar Regiment]]\n|[[Sagar, Madhya Pradesh|Sagar]], Madhya Pradesh\n|1941\n|-\n|[[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]]\n|Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh\n|1821\n|-\n|[[Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry]]\n|[[Avantipur]], [[Jammu and Kashmir]]\n|1947\n|-\n|[[Naga Regiment]]\n|Ranikhet, Uttarakhand\n|1970\n|-\n|[[1 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Sabathu]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]\n|1815\n|-\n|[[3 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1815\n|-\n|[[4 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Sabathu, Himachal Pradesh\n|1857\n|-\n|[[5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force)]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1858\n|-\n|[[8 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|1824\n|-\n|[[9 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh\n|1817\n|-\n|[[11 Gorkha Rifles]]\n|[[Lucknow]], Uttar Pradesh\n|1918\n|-\n|[[Ladakh Scouts]]\n|[[Leh]], Jammu and Kashmir\n|1963\n|-\n|[[Rashtriya Rifles]]\n|\n|1990\n|-\n|[[Arunachal Scouts]]\n|Shillong, Meghalaya\n|2010\n|-\n|[[Sikkim Scouts]]\n|\n|2013\n|}\n\n'''Artillery'''\n[[File:The DRDO's Pinaka Launcher system gliding down the Rajpath during the Republic Day Parade - 2006, in New Delhi on January 26, 2006.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Pinaka Multi Barrel Rocket Launcher]]s were used during the [[Kargil War]].]]\nThe [[Regiment of Artillery]] is the second largest arm of the Indian Army, constituting nearly one sixth of the Army's total strength.

The 1990s saw the formation of the Corps of Army Air Defence and the coalescing of all aviation assets into the Army Aviation Corps.

The Corps consists of three groups of combat engineers, namely the Madras Sappers, the Bengal Sappers and the Bombay Sappers. A group is roughly analogous to a regiment of Indian infantry, each group consisting of a number of engineer regiments. The engineer regiment is the basic combat engineer unit, analogous to an infantry battalion.\n\n'''Corps of Signals'''\n\n[[Indian Army Corps of Signals]] is a corps and the arm of the Indian Army which handles its [[military communications]].

The corps actively took part in the [[Second World War]] fighting on behalf of the [[British Empire]]. Post independence, the corps has participated in all the [[wars involving India]], starting from the [[1947 Indo-Pakistani War]] to the [[1999 Kargil conflict]]. The corps enjoyed autonomous status from 1994, after the bifurcation of the Corps of Air Defence Artillery from the Army's artillery regiment. A separate training school, the Army Air Defence College (AADC), was established to train its personnel.\n\n'''Para (Special Forces)'''\n\n[[Para (Special Forces)]], commonly known as '''Para SF''', is the [[special operations]] unit of Indian Army.

With time, its role has evolved into cross border intelligence, intelligence sharing with friendly nations, infiltrating insurgent groups and counter-terrorism. In the late 1970s, the MI was embroiled in the [[Samba spy scandal]] wherein three Indian Army officers were falsely implicated as Pakistani spies. The organisation has since emerged from the scandal as a prime Intelligence organisation of the Indian Army. {{as of|2012}}, the MI has seen many of its roles taken away by the newly created [[National Technical Research Organisation]] and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |title=How Indian Army's Military Intelligence Directorate works : Special Report&nbsp;\u2013 India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031141954/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bangladesh-indian-army-military-intelligence-directorate-sheikh-hasina/1/170880.html |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Since it was set up in 2004 as a premier apex scientific agency under the National Security Adviser in the Prime Minister's Office,  it also includes the National Institute of Cryptology Research and Development (NICRD), which is the first of its kind in Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|title=State govt allots land for NTRO in Borda village|work=IBNLive|accessdate=4 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017235147/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/state-govt-allots-land-for-ntro-in-borda-village/424811-3-236.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Field formations===\nBelow are the basic field formations of the Indian Army:\n\n*[[Command (military formation)|Command]]: Indian Army has six operational commands and one training command.

Substantive promotions up to lieutenant colonel or equivalent are based on time in service whereas those for colonel and above are based on selection, with promotion to colonel also based on time served.\n\n{{Equivalent ranks of Indian military}}\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!Equivalent<br />NATO code\n|colspan=1|OF-10\n|colspan=1|OF-9\n|colspan=1|OF-8\n|colspan=1|OF-7\n|colspan=1|OF-6\n|colspan=1|OF-5\n|colspan=1|OF-4\n|colspan=1|OF-3\n|colspan=1|OF-2\n|OF-1 \n|- align=center\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n|- align=center\n|+ '''Ranks of the Indian Army - Officer Ranks'''\n||'''Shoulder<br/>Insignia'''\n|| [[File:Field Marshal of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:General of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Lieutenant General of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Major General of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Brigadier of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Colonel of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Lieutenant Colonel of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Major of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Captain of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|| [[File:Lieutenant of the Indian Army.svg|40px]]\n|- align=center\n||'''Rank'''\n|| [[Field Marshal (India)|Field <br /> Marshal]]<sup>1</sup>\n|| [[General (India)|General]]<sup>2</sup>\n|| [[Lieutenant General (India)|Lieutenant <br /> General]]\n|| [[Major General|Major <br /> General]]\n|| [[Brigadier]]\n|| [[Colonel]]\n|| [[Lieutenant Colonel|Lieutenant <br /> Colonel]]\n|| [[Major]]\n|| [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]]\n|| [[Lieutenant]]\n|- align=center\n|colspan=8|\n|-\n|colspan=5|\n* <sup>1</sup>Honorary/wartime rank.\n* <sup>2</sup>Held only by the [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]]\n|}\n\n{{multiple image|caption_align=center|header_align=center|direction=vertical\n | image1 = An Indian Army paratrooper with the 50th Independent Para Brigade exits a CH47 Chinook helicopter during a partnered airborne training exercise with U.S. Army paratroopers in 2013.jpg\n | alt1 =\n | width1 = 240\n\n | image2 = An Indian Army paratrooper with the 50th Independent Para Brigade exits a CH47 Chinook helicopter in 2013.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | width2 = 240\n | footer = An Indian Army paratrooper with the [[50th Parachute Brigade (India)|50th Parachute Brigade]] jumps from a helicopter\n}}\n\n'''Other Ranks'''\n\n{{Indian_Army_enlisted_ranks}}\n\n===Uniforms===\n[[File:IndianArmyDelhi.JPG|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[Assam Regiment]] ]]\n\nThe Indian Army camouflage consists of shirts, trousers and cap of a synthetic material. Shirts are buttoned up with two chest pockets with buttoned up flaps. Trousers have two pockets, two thigh box pockets and a back pocket. The Indian Army Jungle [[camouflage]] dress features a jungle camouflage pattern and is designed for use in woodland environments. The Indian Army Desert camouflage, which features a desert camouflage pattern, is used by artillery and infantry posted in dusty, semi-desert and desert areas of [[Rajasthan]] and its vicinity.\n\nThe forces of the [[East India Company]] in India were forced by casualties to dye their white summer [[tunic]]s to neutral tones, initially a tan called [[khaki]] (from the [[Hindi]] word for \"dusty\"). This was a temporary measure which became standard in the Indian service in the 1880s. Only during the [[Second Boer War]] in 1902, did the entire [[British Army]] standardise on [[dun]] for [[Service Dress (British Army)|Service Dress]]. The Indian Army uniform standardises on dun for khaki.\nThe modern Indian Army wears distinctive parade uniforms characterised by variegated turbans and waist-sashes in regimental colours. The Gurkha and Garwhal Rifles and the Assam, Kumaon and Naga Regiments wear broad brimmed hats of traditional style. Traditionally, all rifle regiments (the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, the Garhwal Rifles, all Gorkha Rifles, and the Rajputana Rifles) as well as the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry wear [[rank badge]]s, buttons and blackened wire embroidered articles of uniform in black instead of the usual brass (or gold) colour as the original role of the rifle regiments was camouflage and concealment.\n\n===Medals and awards===\n{{Main|Awards and decorations of the Indian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe medals awarded by the President of India for gallantry displayed at the battlefield, in order of precedence, are- [[Param Vir Chakra]], [[Maha Vir Chakra]] and [[Vir Chakra]].\n\nThe medals awarded by the President for gallantry displayed away from the battlefield, in order of precedence, are- [[Ashoka Chakra (military decoration)|Ashoka Chakra]], [[Kirti Chakra]] and [[Shaurya Chakra]].\n\nMany of the recipients of these awards have been Indian Army personnel.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:Dr Seema Rao Woman Commando Trainer at Corps Battle School Northern Command Indian Army.png|alt=|thumb|A female officer in the Indian Army briefing soldiers on firing techniques.]]\nThe role of [[Women in Indian Armed Forces#Indian Army|women in the Indian army]] began when the \"Indian Military Nursing Service\" was formed in 1888, and nurses fought in World War I and II where 350 Indian Army nurses either died or were taken prisoner of war or declared missing in action, this includes nurses who died when SS Kuala was sunk by the Japanese Bombers in 1942.<ref>[http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indian-army-must-stop-its-discrimination-against-military-nurses/story-VmhPT6cKj3GW3M3KjCterK.html Indian Army must stop its discrimination against military nurses] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214073109/http://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indian-army-must-stop-its-discrimination-against-military-nurses/story-VmhPT6cKj3GW3M3KjCterK.html |date=14 December 2017 }}, [[Hindustan Times]], 13 December 2017.</ref> In 1992, the Indian Army began inducting women officers in non-medical roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joinindianarmy.nic.in/bravo/entry-schemes-women.htm|title=Entry Schemes Women : Officers Selection - Join Indian Army|website=joinindianarmy.nic.in|access-date=21 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225175117/http://joinindianarmy.nic.in/Bravo/entry-schemes-women.htm|archive-date=25 February 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 19 January 2007, the United Nations first all female peacekeeping force made up of 105 Indian policewomen was deployed to [[Liberia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=First All-Female U.N.

He is seen getting released and planning a robbery to steal a diamond with the help of his goofball cohort Percy ([[Tracy Morgan]]). After the successful robbery, the duo are almost arrested, but not before Calvin manages to stash the diamond in a nearby woman's purse. The thieves follow the handbag's owner to her home where they discover a couple, Darryl ([[Shawn Wayans]]) and Vanessa Edwards ([[Kerry Washington]]), who are eager to have a child.\n\nCalvin and Percy hatch a plot to pass Calvin off as a baby left on the couple's doorstep. After seeing Calvin, Darryl and Vanessa, wanting a child, immediately adopt the baby as their own. However, Vanessa's dad Francis \"Pops\" ([[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]]) has a bad feeling about Calvin. Friends of the couple find Calvin strange as well. Despite this, Calvin takes a liking to having a family and starts to feel remorse for using them. A local goon named Walken ([[Chazz Palminteri]]), discovers the deception and demands the diamond from Percy. \n\nDarryl and Vanessa decide to adopt Calvin but upon coming home from a date, they find Pops and Calvin having a brutal fight as the former has discovered Calvin\u2019s secret. Darryl finds it odd that Pops would harm an innocent child so he watches surveillance footage from a nanny cam bear and witnesses Calvin admit to his deception. Walken and his henchmen come by the house, convinced that Darryl is really Calvin - after Percy lies to get out of trouble. In a series of comedic maneuvers, Calvin manages to rescue Darryl and have Walken arrested. Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police.\n\nBefore he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends. The film ends at some point in the future with Calvin and Pops playing with Darryl and Vanessa's real baby, who looks ''exactly'' like Darryl (Shawn Wayans's face superimposed on that of the baby).\nKusseslikker\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Calvin Simms\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Darryl Edwards\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Vanessa Edwards\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Pops\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Percy \n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Greg\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Walken\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Soccer Mom  \n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Jimmy\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Rosco\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Brittany\n* [[Linden Porco]] as Calvin Body\n* [[Gabriel Pimentel]] as Calvin Body\n* [[John DeSantis]] as Bruno (credited as John De Santis)\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Richard\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Janet\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park]] as The Jeweler\n* [[Damien Dante Wayans]] as Officer Wilson\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as D-Rex (uncredited cameo)\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in the [[Vancouver]] area on September 17, 2005, and finished on January 21, 2006.\n\nThe scenes with Calvin Simms were played twice: once by nine year old 75&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft 6 in) tall [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Linden Porco]] together with the other actors, and once by [[Marlon Wayans]] alone, using a \"[[Chroma key|bluescreen]]\" technique with a green background and green clothes.

Darryl is given a substantial reward for the recovery of the diamond, and since Calvin saved his life, he doesn't turn him over to the police.\n\nBefore he leaves, Calvin thanks Darryl for taking care of him even though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl would make a great father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave. Calvin is crying hysterically, so Darryl decides to let Calvin stay and from that point on, the two men become the best of friends. The film ends at some point in the future with Calvin and Pops playing with Darryl and Vanessa's real baby, who looks ''exactly'' like Darryl (Shawn Wayans's face superimposed on that of the baby).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Calvin Simms\n* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Darryl Edwards\n* [[Kerry Washington]] as Vanessa Edwards\n* [[John Witherspoon (actor)|John Witherspoon]] as Pops\n* [[Tracy Morgan]] as Percy \n* [[Lochlyn Munro]] as Greg\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Walken\n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Soccer Mom  \n* [[David Alan Grier]] as Jimmy\n* [[Dave Sheridan (actor)|Dave Sheridan]] as Rosco\n* [[Brittany Daniel]] as Brittany\n* [[Linden Porco]] as Calvin Body\n* [[Gabriel Pimentel]] as Calvin Body\n* [[John DeSantis]] as Bruno (credited as John De Santis)\n* [[Fred Stoller]] as Richard\n* [[Alex Borstein]] as Janet\n* [[Kelly Coffield Park]] as The Jeweler\n* [[Damien Dante Wayans]] as Officer Wilson\n* [[Rob Schneider]] as D-Rex (uncredited cameo)\n\n==Production==\nFilming began in the [[Vancouver]] area on September 17, 2005, and finished on January 21, 2006.\n\nThe scenes with Calvin Simms were played twice: once by nine year old 75&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;ft 6 in) tall [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] actor [[Linden Porco]] together with the other actors, and once by [[Marlon Wayans]] alone, using a \"[[Chroma key|bluescreen]]\" technique with a green background and green clothes.

He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald>{{cite web |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |date=2009 |website=highered.mcgraw-hill.com |accessdate=2019-08-04}}</ref><ref name=truth>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}</ref> The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].\n\n===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===\n\nDevelopmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as \"[[ego integrity]]\". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald/><ref name=truth/>\n\n===Terror management theory===\n{{main|Terror management theory}}\n[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life\u2014Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald/><ref name=truth/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harmon-Jones |first1=Eddie |last2=Simon |first2=Linda |last3=Greenberg |first3=Jeff |last4=Pyszczynski |first4=Tom |last5=Solomon |first5=Sheldon |last6=McGregor |first6=Holly |date=January 1997 |title=Terror management theory and self-esteem: evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201336 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24 |pmid=9008372}}</ref>\n\nAs an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.<ref name=Castano2011/>{{rp|603}}\n\n===Being, time and Dasein===\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as \"clearing\". Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as \"stop denying being-for-death\").<ref name=concepts>Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010.

Washington, DC: Taylor & Francis.</ref> Apart from acceptances, his work also represents different aspects of the meaning of death fear that are rooted in the bases of death anxiety. The ten meanings he proposes are finality, uncertainty, annihilation, ultimate loss, life flow disruption, leaving the loved ones, pain and loneliness, prematurity and violence of death, failure of life work completion, judgment and retribution centered.\n\n===Other theories===\n\nOther theories on death anxiety were introduced in the late part of the twentieth century.<ref name=\"Langs 2003. p570\">Langs.\" Adaptive Insights into Death Anxiety\" The Psychoanalytic Review.2003.p570</ref> The existential approach, with theorists such as [[Rollo May]] and [[Viktor Frankl]], views an individual's personality as being governed by the continuous choices and decisions in relation to the realities of life and death.<ref>Schacter, Daniel L. \"Psychology\" 2011.

People tend to develop personal meanings of death which could accordingly be negative or positive for the individual. If they are positive, then the consequences of those meanings can be comforting (for example, ideas of a rippling effect<ref>{{cite book |last=Yalom |first=Irvin D. |authorlink=Irvin D.

Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men.

However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40\u201364 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).

He said he saw this as a disguise for a deeper source of concern. It was not actually death that people feared, because in Freud's view nobody believes in their own death. The unconscious does not deal with the passage of time or with negations, which does not calculate amount of time left in one's life. Furthermore, that which one does fear cannot be death itself, because one has never died. People who express death-related fears, actually are trying to deal with unresolved childhood conflicts that they cannot come to terms with or express emotion towards.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald>{{cite web |url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078883601/680442/Additional_Lifespan_Development_Topics.pdf |title=Additional Lifespan Development Topics |date=2009 |website=highered.mcgraw-hill.com |accessdate=2019-08-04}}</ref><ref name=truth>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-wan_XhkzcC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106|title=The Truth about Death and Dying|first1=Karen|last1=Meyers|first2=Robert N.|last2=Golden|first3=Fred|last3=Peterson|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781438125817}}</ref> The name Thanatophobia is made from the Greek figure of death known as [[Thanatos]].\n\n===Wisdom: ego integrity vs. despair===\n\nDevelopmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] formulated the psychosocial theory that explained that people progress through a series of crises as they grow older. The theory also envelops the concept that once an individual reaches the latest stages of life, they reach the level he titled as \"[[ego integrity]]\". Ego Integrity is when one comes to terms with their life and accepts it. It was also suggested that when a person reaches the stage of late adulthood they become involved in a thorough overview of their life to date. When one can find meaning or purpose in their life, they have reached the integrity stage. In opposition, when an individual views their life as a series of failed and missed opportunities, then they do not reach the ego integrity stage. Elders that have attained this stage of ego integrity are believed to exhibit less of an influence from death anxiety.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald/><ref name=truth/>\n\n===Terror management theory===\n{{main|Terror management theory}}\n[[Ernest Becker]] based this theory on existential views which turned death anxiety theories towards a new dimension. It said that death anxiety is not only real, but also it is people's most profound source of concern. He explained the anxiety as so intense that it can generate fears and phobias of everyday life\u2014Fears of being alone or in a confined space. Based on the theory, many of people's daily behavior consist of attempts to deny death and to keep their anxiety under strict regulation.<ref name=escp/><ref name=ald/><ref name=truth/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Harmon-Jones |first1=Eddie |last2=Simon |first2=Linda |last3=Greenberg |first3=Jeff |last4=Pyszczynski |first4=Tom |last5=Solomon |first5=Sheldon |last6=McGregor |first6=Holly |date=January 1997 |title=Terror management theory and self-esteem: evidence that increased self-esteem reduces mortality salience effects |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=24\u201336 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.1.24 |pmid=9008372}}</ref>\n\nAs an individual develops [[mortality salience]], i.e. becomes more aware of the inevitability of death, they will instinctively try to suppress it out of fear. The method of suppression usually leads to mainstreaming towards cultural beliefs, leaning for external support rather than treading alone. This behavior may range from simply thinking about death to severe phobias and desperate actions.<ref name=Castano2011/>{{rp|603}}\n\n===Being, time and Dasein===\n\n[[Martin Heidegger]], the German philosopher, on the one hand showed death as something conclusively determined, in the sense that it is inevitable for every human being, while on the other hand, it unmasks its indeterminate nature via the truth that one never knows when or how death is going to come. Heidegger does not engage in speculation about whether being after death is possible. He argues that all human existence is embedded in time: past, present, future, and when considering the future, we encounter the notion of death. This then creates angst. Angst can create a clear understanding in one that death is a possible mode of existence, which Heidegger described as \"clearing\". Thus, angst can lead to a freedom about existence, but only if we can stop denying our mortality (as expressed in Heidegger's terminology as \"stop denying being-for-death\").<ref name=concepts>Mohammad Samir Hossain and Peter Gilbert. 2010.

Recent studies that assess fear of death in children use questionnaire rating scales.<ref name=maya/> There are many tests to study this including The Death Anxiety Scale for Children (DASC) developed by Schell and Seefeldt.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Slaughter|first=Virginia|author2=Griffiths|title=Death Understanding and Fear of Death in Young Children|journal=Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry|date=October 2007|volume=12 | issue = 4|pages=525\u2013535|doi=10.1177/1359104507080980|pmid=18095535}}</ref> However the most common version of this test is the revised Fear Survey Schedule for Children (FSSC-R).<ref name=maya/>  The FSSC-R describes specific fearful stimuli and children are asked to rate the degree to which the scenario/item makes them anxious or fearful.<ref name=maya/>  The most recent version of the FSSC-R presents the scenarios in a pictorial form to children as young as 4. It is called the Koala Fear Questionnaire (KFQ).<ref name=maya/>  The fear studies show that children's fears can be grouped into five categories.

This may suggest that it is helpful to teach children about death (in a biological sense), in order to alleviate the fear.<ref>Slaughter, V., Griffiths, M. (2007).

A series of tests determined that significantly high levels of death anxiety tend to occur in close relationships with an intimate partner (more so amongst females than males).<ref>Beggs, J. R.The relationship between adult attachment style and death anxiety as related to a romantic partner. Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering, 5231.</ref>\n\n== Sexes ==\nThe connection between death anxiety and one's sex appears to be strong.  Studies show that females tend to have more death anxiety than males.  Thorson and Powell (1984) did a study to investigate this connection, and they sampled men and women from 16 years of age to over 60.  The Death Anxiety Scale showed higher mean scores for women than for men. Moreover, researchers believe that age and culture could be major influences in why women score higher on death anxiety scales than men.<ref name=\"Harrawood, L. K. 2008\">Harrawood, L. K., White, L.

However, during the next phase of life, the middle age adult years (40\u201364 years of age), death anxiety peaks at its highest levels when in comparison to all other age ranges throughout the lifespan.  Surprisingly, levels of death anxiety then slump off in the old age years of adulthood (65 years of age and older).  This is in contrast with most people's expectations, especially regarding all of the negative connotations younger adults have about the elderly and the aging process (Kurlychek & Trenner, 1982).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trenner|title=Accuracy of perception and attitude: An intergenerational investigation|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1982|volume=54|issue=1|pages=271\u2013274|doi=10.2466/pms.1982.54.1.271}}</ref>\n\n== Measuring ==\n\nThere are many ways to measure death anxiety and fear.<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\">Tomer.Eliason.\"Toward a comprehensive model of death anxiety\" Death Stuides.1996.p353</ref> Katenbaum and Aeinsberg (1972) devised three propositions for this measurement.<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\"/> From this start, the ideologies about death anxiety have been able to be recorded and their attributes listed.<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\"/> Methods such as imagery tasks to simple questionnaires and apperception tests such as the [[Stroop effect#Stroop test|Stroop test]] enable psychologists to adequately determine if a person is under stress due to death anxiety or suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\"/>\nThe Lester attitude death scale was developed in 1966 but not published until 1991 until its validity was established.<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\"/> By measuring the general attitude towards death and also the inconsistencies with death attitudes, participants are scaled to their favorable value towards death.<ref name=\"Tomer 1996. p353\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afterlife]]\n* [[Death row phenomenon]]\n* [[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\n* [[Eschatology]]\n* [[Immortality]]\n* ''[[The Denial of Death]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*N.
