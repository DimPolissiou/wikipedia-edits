At the same time, ''Fortune'' published companion \"''Fortune'' 50\" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). ''Fortune'' magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies.

At the same time, ''Fortune'' published companion \"''Fortune'' 50\" lists of the 50 largest commercial banks (ranked by assets), utilities (ranked by assets), life insurance companies (ranked by assets), retailers (ranked by gross revenues) and transportation companies (ranked by revenues). ''Fortune'' magazine changed its methodology in 1994 to include service companies. With the change came 291 new entrants to the famous list including three in the Top 10.<ref>{{cite news |last=Groves |first=Martha |date=26 April 1995 |title=Service Now Counts with Fortune 500 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-26/business/fi-59111_1_fortune-services-companies |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=12 October 2017}}</ref> There is a lag in creating the list, so for example, the 2019 ''Fortune'' 500 is based on each company's financial years ending in late 2018 (most commonly, on December 31), or early 2019.\n\n==Influence==\nAs of 2019, the ''Fortune'' 500 companies represent approximately two-thirds of the [[Economy of the United States#GDP|United States's Gross Domestic Product]] with approximately $13.7 trillion in revenue, $1.1 trillion in profits, and $22.6 trillion in total market value. These numbers also account for approximately 17% of the [[gross world product]]. The companies collectively employ a total of 28.7 million people worldwide, or 0.4% of the [[World population|Earth's total population]].<ref>{{cite

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson was also an archaeologist, and contributed articles on ancient sculpture to the ''Revue Arch\u00e9ologique'' and the ''M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions''.

It was pivotal in redirecting the Indonesian national revolution.\n\nIn his pamphlet Sjahrir addressed all crucial spearheads of the still ongoing revolutionary struggle for Indonesia's independence. His target audiences are firstly and primarily the Indonesian masses and their leaders involved in the revolution, secondly public opinion in the colonial metropolis of the Netherlands, home of the adversary and thirdly international public opinion.\n\nThe Dutch-language editions of 1946 contain opening words by ''Perhimpoenan Indonesia'' and were used to sway Dutch public opinion during the [[Linggadjati Agreement|''Linggadjati negotiations'']]. Its English translation was distributed at [[Westminster Hall]] to the British delegates to the [[United Nations]].<ref>Bayly, Christopher Harper, Tim ''Forgotten Wars, Freedom and revolution in Southeast Asia'' (Publisher: Harvard University Press, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02153-2}}  P.185 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0M4Pl_VCExgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=forgotten+wars&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mVUMUKznDMnO0QXyjKzlCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=forgotten%20wars&f=false  Googlebooks]</ref>\n\nSjahrir's writings successfully countered the myth that the Indonesian republic was the brainchild of the fascist imperial Japanese forces and not a deep national desire.\n\n==Context==\nAfter the defeat of the [[Japanese Empire]] and ''de facto'' end of [[World War II]], the capitulated and disillusioned Japanese Army and Navy in the former Dutch colony of the [[Dutch East Indies]] retreat to their barracks and await relief by Allied forces. Before the postponed arrival of Allied forces and their demobilisation the Japanese troops remain responsible to guard their former Allied POW's and European civilian prisoners.\n\nAugust 1945 Indonesian leaders are pressured by revolutionary youth groups, to unilaterally declare the independent Republic of Indonesia. Within a few months the power vacuum left by retreating Japanese forces and the gradually arriving Allied forces explodes into full scale revolutionary tension. Social outgroups that next to Dutch people, include [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Indo people|Dutch-Indonesian Eurasians]], and Christian Indonesians such as the [[Depok]], Ambonese and Menadonese people fall victim to violent atrocities.\n\nA chaotic time of extreme aggression erupts that is remembered by the Dutch and Indo European victims as the [[Bersiap]] period. Sjahrir was the first leader to strongly oppose and condemn the violence committed against (fellow) citizens.\n\n==Author==\n[[File:Soetan Sjahrir 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Public speaker Soetan Sjahrir]]\nAfter writing this pamphlet Sjahrir joined [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]], the president and vice-president of the unilaterally declared republic of Indonesia as their first prime-minister. While Sukarno and Hatta were accused of having collaborated with the Axis forces and being puppets of the Japanese military, Sjahrir's reputation as anti-fascist and resistance leader enabled him to engage in the original negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial administration as well as the later ''Linggadjati negotiations''.\n \n\"Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack.\" Sol Tas.<ref>[http://cip.cornell.edu/seap.indo/1107140092  Tas, Sol ''Souvenirs of Sjahrir'' P.150]</ref>\n\n==Content==\nThe pamphlet's content consists of a level headed analysis of the early situation of the revolution and clear recommendations for its successful continuation. Sjahrir warns against the negative effect the extreme violence has on the goodwill of international public opinion. Sjahrir clarifies the intense impact Japanese indoctrination has had on the Indonesian people, especially the youth (Indonesian: Pemuda). To deflect the ever growing hatred of the Japanese by the Indonesian people, the Japanese propaganda singled out ethnic target groups for persecution: westerners, [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Indo people]] (Eurasians), Menadonese people and Ambonese people. By the end of the Japanese occupation practices such as mandatory forced labour (Japanese: Romusha), that on average killed 80% of the Indonesian coolies, caused Indonesias rural and urban communities to become impoverished, dislocated, in uproar and disarray. Sjahrir explains Indonesians will never accept any form of colonisation ever again.\n\n==Publications==\nIn 1945 the Dutch-language pamphlet was originally written by Sjahrir in Jakarta, immediately thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' (Our Struggle). A Dutch-language book with his preliminary thoughts named \"Indonesische overpeinzingen\" (Indonesian musings) was published that same year by publisher Bezige Bij, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1946 a first edition of 9,000 pamphlets and second edition of an additional 8,000 pamphlets was printed in the Netherlands by 'Cloeck & Moedigh', published in the Dutch language by Uitgevery 'Vrij Nederland' Amsterdam under the auspices of [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]].<ref>Sjahrir, Soetan ''Onze Strijd'' (Publisher: Vrij Nederland, Amsterdam, 1946) P.4</ref>\n\nIn 1949 his book was translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York. The later English version contains a considerable amount of additional text.<ref>Kousbroek, Rudy Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom.

Only a nationalism that is founded in these feelings will take us further in world history.\n\nA national revolution is only the result of a democratic revolution, and nationalism should be second to democracy. The State of Indonesia is only a name we give to the essence we intend and aim for.\n\nFrom the start the world had been sympathetic towards our national struggle. Public opinion [...] was on our side, however recent developments show our peoples disarray and can't be accepted as features of our struggle for freedom, [..] distrust, features of fascist cruelty [...] particularly the murder and cruelty aimed at Indos, Ambonese, and Menadonese who in any case still are our fellow countrymen.\n\nThis hatred towards Indos, Ambonese, Menadonese can only be explained as a lack of national consciousness among the masses of our people.\n\nUntil now we have not taken the satisfactory political position towards these groups (Indo-Europeans, Indo-Asians, Ambonese, Menadonese and others). In fact things have happened that are plain wrong (and must be condemned) and detrimental to our revolution.\n\nHatred against minorities and foreigners are a hidden factor in any nationalist struggle..., but a nationalist movement that lets itself be carried away by xenophobia will in the end find the whole world against itself. The nationalist movement ... will demise in self-destruction.<ref>Sjahrir, Soetan ''Onze Strijd'' (Publisher: Vrij Nederland, Amsterdam, 1946) P15-16, 27 [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2656932]</ref>}}\n\n===Pages===\n<Gallery>\nFile:SoetanSjahrir OnzeStrijd PageB.jpg|'Onze Strijd' Page 16\nFile:SoetanSjahrir OnzeStrijd PageA.jpg|'Onze Strijd' Page 27\n</Gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bersiap]]\n* [[Sutan Sjahrir]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of Indonesia]]\n* [[Sjahrir I Cabinet]]\n* [[Sjahrir II Cabinet]]\n* [[Sjahrir III Cabinet]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes and citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Sjahrir, Soetan (1946).

It was pivotal in redirecting the Indonesian national revolution.\n\nIn his pamphlet Sjahrir addressed all crucial spearheads of the still ongoing revolutionary struggle for Indonesia's independence. His target audiences are firstly and primarily the Indonesian masses and their leaders involved in the revolution, secondly public opinion in the colonial metropolis of the Netherlands, home of the adversary and thirdly international public opinion.\n\nThe Dutch language editions of 1946 contain opening words by ''Perhimpoenan Indonesia'' and were used to sway Dutch public opinion during the [[Linggadjati Agreement|''Linggadjati negotiations'']]. Its English translation was distributed at [[Westminster Hall]] to the British delegates to the [[United Nations]].<ref>Bayly, Christopher Harper, Tim ''Forgotten Wars, Freedom and revolution in Southeast Asia'' (Publisher: Harvard University Press, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-674-02153-2}}  P.185 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0M4Pl_VCExgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=forgotten+wars&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mVUMUKznDMnO0QXyjKzlCg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=forgotten%20wars&f=false  Googlebooks]</ref>\n\nSjahrir's writings successfully countered the myth that the Indonesian republic was the brainchild of the fascist imperial Japanese forces and not a deep national desire.\n\n==Context==\nAfter the defeat of the [[Japanese Empire]] and ''de facto'' end of [[World War II]], the capitulated and disillusioned Japanese Army and Navy in the former Dutch colony of the [[Dutch East Indies]] retreat to their barracks and await relief by Allied forces. Before the postponed arrival of Allied forces and their demobilisation the Japanese troops remain responsible to guard their former Allied POW's and European civilian prisoners.\n\nAugust 1945 Indonesian leaders are pressured by revolutionary youth groups, to unilaterally declare the independent Republic of Indonesia. Within a few months the power vacuum left by retreating Japanese forces and the gradually arriving Allied forces explodes into full scale revolutionary tension. Social outgroups that next to Dutch people, include [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Indo people|Dutch-Indonesian Eurasians]], and Christian Indonesians such as the [[Depok]], Ambonese and Menadonese people fall victim to violent atrocities.\n\nA chaotic time of extreme aggression erupts that is remembered by the Dutch and Indo European victims as the [[Bersiap]] period. Sjahrir was the first leader to strongly oppose and condemn the violence committed against (fellow) citizens.\n\n==Author==\n[[File:Soetan Sjahrir 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Public speaker Soetan Sjahrir]]\nAfter writing this pamphlet Sjahrir joined [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]], the president and vice-president of the unilaterally declared republic of Indonesia as their first prime-minister. While Sukarno and Hatta were accused of having collaborated with the Axis forces and being puppets of the Japanese military, Sjahrir's reputation as anti-fascist and resistance leader enabled him to engage in the original negotiations with the returning Dutch colonial administration as well as the later ''Linggadjati negotiations''.\n \n\"Perhaps the high point of his career was the publication of his pamphlet 'Our Struggle'. Whoever reads that pamphlet today can scarcely comprehend what it demanded in insight and courage. For it appeared at a moment when the Indonesian masses, brought to the boiling point by the Japanese occupation and civil war, sought release in racist and other hysterical outbursts. Sjahrir's pamphlet went directly against this, and many must have felt his call for chivalry, for the understanding of other ethnic groups, as a personal attack.\" Sol Tas.<ref>[http://cip.cornell.edu/seap.indo/1107140092  Tas, Sol ''Souvenirs of Sjahrir'' P.150]</ref>\n\n==Content==\nThe pamphlet's content consists of a level headed analysis of the early situation of the revolution and clear recommendations for its successful continuation. Sjahrir warns against the negative effect the extreme violence has on the goodwill of international public opinion. Sjahrir clarifies the intense impact Japanese indoctrination has had on the Indonesian people, especially the youth (Indonesian: Pemuda). To deflect the ever growing hatred of the Japanese by the Indonesian people, the Japanese propaganda singled out ethnic target groups for persecution: westerners, [[Chinese Indonesians]], [[Indo people]] (Eurasians), Menadonese people and Ambonese people. By the end of the Japanese occupation practices such as mandatory forced labour (Japanese: Romusha), that on average killed 80% of the Indonesian coolies, caused Indonesias rural and urban communities to become impoverished, dislocated, in uproar and disarray. Sjahrir explains Indonesians will never accept any form of colonisation ever again.\n\n==Publications==\nIn 1945 the Dutch language pamphlet was originally written by Sjahrir in Jakarta, immediately thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' (Our Struggle). A Dutch language book with his preliminary thoughts named \"Indonesische overpeinzingen\" (Indonesian musings) was published that same year by publisher Bezige Bij, Amsterdam.\n\nIn 1946 a first edition of 9,000 pamphlets and second edition of an additional 8,000 pamphlets was printed in the Netherlands by 'Cloeck & Moedigh', published in the Dutch language by Uitgevery 'Vrij Nederland' Amsterdam under the auspices of [[Perhimpoenan Indonesia]].<ref>Sjahrir, Soetan ''Onze Strijd'' (Publisher: Vrij Nederland, Amsterdam, 1946) P.4</ref>\n\nIn 1949 his book was translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York. The later English version contains a considerable amount of additional text.<ref>Kousbroek, Rudy Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom.

Only a nationalism that is founded in these feelings will take us further in world history.\n\nA national revolution is only the result of a democratic revolution, and nationalism should be second to democracy. The State of Indonesia is only a name we give to the essence we intend and aim for.\n\nFrom the start the world had been sympathetic towards our national struggle. Public opinion [...] was on our side, however recent developments show our peoples disarray and can't be accepted as features of our struggle for freedom, [..] distrust, features of fascist cruelty [...] particularly the murder and cruelty aimed at Indos, Ambonese, and Menadonese who in any case still are our fellow countrymen.\n\nThis hatred towards Indos, Ambonese, Menadonese can only be explained as a lack of national consciousness among the masses of our people.\n\nUntil now we have not taken the satisfactory political position towards these groups (Indo-Europeans, Indo-Asians, Ambonese, Menadonese and others). In fact things have happened that are plain wrong (and must be condemned) and detrimental to our revolution.\n\nHatred against minorities and foreigners are a hidden factor in any nationalist struggle..., but a nationalist movement that lets itself be carried away by xenophobia will in the end find the whole world against itself. The nationalist movement ... will demise in self-destruction.<ref>Sjahrir, Soetan ''Onze Strijd'' (Publisher: Vrij Nederland, Amsterdam, 1946) P15-16, 27 [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2656932]</ref>}}\n\n===Pages===\n<Gallery>\nFile:SoetanSjahrir OnzeStrijd PageB.jpg|'Onze Strijd' Page 16\nFile:SoetanSjahrir OnzeStrijd PageA.jpg|'Onze Strijd' Page 27\n</Gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bersiap]]\n* [[Sutan Sjahrir]]\n* [[List of Prime Ministers of Indonesia]]\n* [[Sjahrir I Cabinet]]\n* [[Sjahrir II Cabinet]]\n* [[Sjahrir III Cabinet]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes and citations===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Sjahrir, Soetan (1946).
