He has won seven [[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]] as well as one [[National Film Awards|National Film Award]] and [[Tamil Nadu State Film Awards|Tamil Nadu State Film Award]] amongst other recognitions and was awarded an [[Honorary Doctorate]] by the [[University of Milan]] in May 2011.\n\nHe made his debut in the 1990 film ''[[En Kadhal Kanmani]]'', which was followed by a series of small-budget Tamil, [[Malayalam cinema|Malayalam]] and [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] films in the 1990s, many of which went unnoticed. However, the success of [[Bala (director)|Bala]]'s tragedy film ''[[Sethu (film)|Sethu]]'' (1999), in which Vikram appeared as a rogue turned lover, started Vikram's successful career as an actor. In the early 2000s, Vikram appeared in a series of [[Masala (film genre)|masala films]], with ''[[Dhill]]'' (2001), ''[[Gemini (2002 Tamil film)|Gemini]]'' (2002), ''[[Dhool]]'' (2003) and ''[[Saamy]]'' (2003) becoming commercially successful ventures. During the period, Vikram also appeared in diverse roles and received critical acclaim for his performance as a blind villager in ''[[Kasi (film)|Kasi]]'' and a [[Robin Hood]]-esque figure in ''[[Samurai (2002 film)|Samurai]]''. In 2003, Vikram's performance as a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorders in Bala's ''[[Pithamagan]]'' saw him win the [[National Film Award for Best Actor]], with his character only speaking a couple of lines of dialogue in the entire film.<ref name=\"pithwin\">{{cite web|author=Kumar, Ashok |date=20 August 2004 |title=Vikram, the Victor |work=The Hindu |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2004/08/20/stories/2004082001760100.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201091647/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2004/08/20/stories/2004082001760100.htm |archivedate= 1 February 2015 |df= }}</ref> \n\nHis appearance as an idealistic lawyer with [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] in [[S.

However, the success of [[Bala (director)|Bala]]'s tragedy film ''[[Sethu (film)|Sethu]]'' (1999), in which Vikram appeared as a rogue turned lover, started Vikram's successful career as an actor. In the early 2000s, Vikram appeared in a series of [[Masala (film genre)|masala films]], with ''[[Dhill]]'' (2001), ''[[Gemini (2002 Tamil film)|Gemini]]'' (2002), ''[[Dhool]]'' (2003) and ''[[Saamy]]'' (2003) becoming commercially successful ventures. During the period, Vikram also appeared in diverse roles and received critical acclaim for his performance as a blind villager in ''[[Kasi (film)|Kasi]]'' and a [[Robin Hood]]-esque figure in ''[[Samurai (2002 film)|Samurai]]''. In 2003, Vikram's performance as a gravedigger with autism spectrum disorders in Bala's ''[[Pithamagan]]'' saw him win the [[National Film Award for Best Actor]], with his character only speaking a couple of lines of dialogue in the entire film.<ref name=\"pithwin\">{{cite web|author=Kumar, Ashok |date=20 August 2004 |title=Vikram, the Victor |work=The Hindu |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/fr/2004/08/20/stories/2004082001760100.htm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201091647/http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/fr/2004/08/20/stories/2004082001760100.htm |archivedate= 1 February 2015 |df= }}</ref> \n\nHis appearance as an idealistic lawyer with [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] in [[S.

Eisenhower]]. After the war, as Secretary of State, Marshall advocated a significant U.S. economic and political commitment to post-war European recovery, including the [[Marshall Plan]] that bore his name. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953.<ref name=a>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/marshall/|title=George Catlett Marshall, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Secretary of State|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2007-12-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113061529/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/kbank/profiles/marshall/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=2007-11-13}}</ref>\n\nBorn in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]], Marshall graduated from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI) in 1901. After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall retired from active service in 1945, but remained on active duty, as required for holders of five-star rank.<ref name=wedemeyer>{{cite web|title=General George C Marshall|url=http://www.general-wedemeyer.com/marshall/|website=general-wedemeyer.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref> From December 15, 1945 to January 1947 Marshall served as a special envoy to China in an unsuccessful effort to negotiate a coalition government between the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] under [[Mao Zedong]].\n\nAs [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1947 to 1949, Marshall advocated rebuilding Europe, a program that became known as the [[Marshall Plan]], and which led to his being awarded the 1953 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name=b>{{cite book|last=W.

As [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] at the start of the [[Korean War]], Marshall worked to restore the military's confidence and morale at the end of its post-World War II demobilization and then its initial buildup for combat in Korea and operations during the [[Cold War]].

''Infantry in Battle'' is still used as an officer's training manual in the Infantry Officer's Course and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II.\n\nFrom June 1932 to June 1933, Marshall was the commanding officer of the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. From July 1933 to October 1933 he was commander of [[Fort Moultrie]], [[South Carolina]] and District I of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and he was promoted to colonel in September 1933.  He was senior instructor and chief of staff for the Illinois National Guard's [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Division]] from November 1933 to August 1936.\n\nMarshall commanded the 5th Brigade of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] in [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver,]] Washington from 1936 to 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936. In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that proved a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed their skills and improved their health. Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called \"the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecmarshall.org|title=Home|website=www.georgecmarshall.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies than a large army.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=26}} Despite others' belief then that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by Roosevelt to be the Army Chief of Staff as his personal choice. Marshall was then only 34th in seniority and outranked by 21 major-generals and 11 brigadier-generals; but he was the fifth-ranking officer under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=27}} \n\nUpon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff.

Marshall saw Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt together; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt \"you have got to do something and you\u2019ve got to do it today\".

Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.<ref>Bland, Larry I., ''George C.

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch.

Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the States. He told Marshall, \"I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.\"<ref name=d>{{cite book|last=Buell|first=Thomas B.|author2=John H.

He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.\n\nThroughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 10, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.

It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39, pp. 144\u201345.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) pp. 252, 265</ref>\n\nA secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L.

Mao promised Marshall the Communists would give up armed revolution, embrace the old enemies, and build a democracy in China.

Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, [[Jim Mattis]] became the second. Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S. Truman Library and Museum}}</ref> (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only \"concurred\" with the relief, not \"recommended\" it.)\n\nOn April 11, 1951, President Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley's signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to [[Matthew Ridgway]]. In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A. Herter]], former Secretary of State Dean G. Acheson, W. Averell Harriman and Generals Omar N. Bradley, [[Alfred M. Gruenther]] and General [[Matthew B. Ridgway]]. His parish priest, Rev. Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C. Marshall Foundation |access-date=July 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, Lieutenant Colonel [[Johnson Hagood (general)|Johnson Hagood]] completed a written evaluation of Marshall's performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote \"Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite book |last=Puryear |first=Edgar F.

In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and eventually the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/marshall/the-marshall-plan/history-marshall-plan/ |title=History of the Marshall Plan |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

Truman]] was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years.

After serving briefly as commandant of students at the [[Danville Military Academy]] in [[Danville, Virginia]], Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February, 1902. In the years after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.  In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the United States entered [[World War I]], Marshall served with Bell while Bell commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in France. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].\n\nAfter the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, commanded the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's Deputy Chief of Staff. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.\n\nAs Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.

From July 1933 to October 1933 he was commander of [[Fort Moultrie]], [[South Carolina]] and District I of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and he was promoted to colonel in September 1933.

In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that proved a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed their skills and improved their health. Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called \"the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecmarshall.org|title=Home|website=www.georgecmarshall.org|access-date=2016-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a conference at the White House at which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort, lacking forethought with regard to logistical support or training. With all other attendees voicing support of the plan, Marshall was the only person to voice his disagreement. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies than a large army.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=26}} Despite others' belief then that he had ended his career, this action resulted in his being nominated by Roosevelt to be the Army Chief of Staff as his personal choice. Marshall was then only 34th in seniority and outranked by 21 major-generals and 11 brigadier-generals; but he was the fifth-ranking officer under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=27}} \n\nUpon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff.

Marshall saw Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt together; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt \"you have got to do something and you\u2019ve got to do it today\".

He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, Krueger and Clark.  A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as \"one of the best\" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, \"I like that man; you can see determination all over his face.\"  Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous Battle of the Kasserine Pass.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Planned invasion of Europe===\n[[File:Infantry in battle cover.gif|thumb|Cover to the book ''Infantry in Battle'', the World War II officer's guide to infantry combat operations. Marshall directed production of the book, which is still used as a reference today.]]\nDuring World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of Italy. Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.\n\nIt was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the States. He told Marshall, \"I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington.\"<ref name=d>{{cite book|last=Buell|first=Thomas B.|author2=John H.

He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.\n\nThroughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943. Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 10, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life.  He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army [[Dwight Eisenhower]].<ref name=\"wedemeyer\"/>\n\n==Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure==\nAfter World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]] received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941. Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39, pp. 144\u201345.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) pp. 252, 265</ref>\n\nA secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L.

Bratton|Bratton]] who, he concluded, arrived later on Sunday morning than he initially claimed during testimony and invented a story about not being able to get in touch with Marshall which \"nearly destroyed\" Marshall.\n\n==Post war: China==\nIn December 1945, President [[Harry Truman]] [[Marshall Mission|sent Marshall]] to China, to broker a coalition government between the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] allies under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] under [[Mao Zedong]]. Mao promised Marshall the Communists would give up armed revolution, embrace the old enemies, and build a democracy in China. Marshall hoped for a coalition government, and toasted their common future.  The Americans assumed that if the Communist won the Civil War, they would remain on friendly terms with the United States. <ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Kurtz-Phelan|title=The China Mission: George Marshall's Unfinished War, 1945-1947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDIsDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT7|year=2018|publisher=W.

Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared that a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey. He told President Truman in May 1948, \"If you (recognize the state of Israel) and if I were to vote in the election, I would vote against you.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=376&PID=0&IID=2203|title=President Truman's Decision to Recognize Israel|accessdate=2009-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306101503/http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=111&FID=376&PID=0&IID=2203|archive-date=2012-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0591/9105017.htm|title=Truman Adviser Recalls May 14, 1948 US Decision to Recognize Israel|date=May\u2013June 1991|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|page=17|accessdate=2009-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hst/h.htm|title=Recognition of Israel|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=The Truman Library}}</ref>  However, Marshall refused to vote in any election as a matter of principle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Uldrich|first1=Jack|title=Soldier, Statesman, Peacemaker: Leadership Lessons from George C.

Marshall.jpg|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall sits for a portrait in 1950.]]\nWhen the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.  The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post.  This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded. Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, [[Jim Mattis]] became the second. Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.\n\n===Korean War===\n[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)]]\nMarshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nMarshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea.  A secret \"eyes only\" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: \"We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=The American Culture of War: The History of US Military Force from World War II to Operation Enduring Freedon|last=Lewis|first=Adrian|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0415890199|location=|page=104}}</ref> At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.\n\nFollowing Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease\u2013fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions. In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines.  When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the Soviet Union during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.\n\n====Relief of General MacArthur====\n{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}\nIncreasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.\n\nHarriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it. Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter. Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause \"the biggest fight of your administration.\" At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief. On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a \"military point of view,\" suggesting that \"if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military.\"\n\nMarshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April. Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them. Truman wrote in his diary that \"it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.trumanlibrary.org/exhibit_documents/index.php?pagenumber=2&titleid=188&tldate=1951-04-06&collectionid=firem&PageID=1&groupid=3416 | accessdate = 5 June 2011 | title = Diary entries, 6\u20137, April 1951, Truman Papers. | publisher = Harry S.

In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].\n\n==Later life==\nMarshall retired in September 1951 to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]] to tend to his gardens and continue his passion for horseback riding. He was head of the American delegation at [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953.  He also served as Chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] from 1949 to 1959.\n\n==Death and burial==\n[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]\nMarshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959 at the age of 78. Although he was entitled to an Official Funeral, Marshall preferred simplicity, so received a Special Military Funeral after lying in state at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 21 hours, guarded by representatives from all the U.S. armed services, as well as a VMI cadet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.army.mil/books/Last_Salute/Ch19.htm|title=Chapter 19 - The Last Salute|website=history.army.mil}}</ref> President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-mast, and was among the invited guests at the funeral service at the [[Fort Myer]] Old Post Chapel; other dignitaries included former President Truman,  Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A.

Franklin Moss Jr. from St. James Episcopal Church  in Leesburg, Virginia conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon Rev. Luther Miller. Following a 19-gun salute, Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]], in a place he had picked, in Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife, Elizabeth Carter Coles (1875\u20131927) and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849\u20131929); his second wife, Katherine Tupper Brown Marshall (1882\u20131978) would later join them.\n\n==Reputation and legacy==\nMarshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army.  In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall \"Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''.\" (Emphasis added.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marshallfoundation.org/library/digital-archive/editorial-note-on-becoming-general-liggettos-aide/ |title=1-070, Editorial Note on Becoming General Liggett's Aide, February 1915 |website=marshallfoundation.org |publisher=George C.

SHe introduced the term \"[[Clinical Psychology|clinical psychology\"]] and is often credited with founding the field that it describes. Witmer created the world's first \"psychological clinic\" at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1896, including the first journal of clinical psychology and the first clinical hospital school in 1907.\n\nWitmer contributed to numerous branches of [[psychology]] including [[school psychology]]. He contributed to the field of [[special education]].\n\nLittle is known about Witmer's life. He is described as an [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] and private person.\n\n==Early life==\n{{One source section|date=September 2017}}\nWitmer was born in [[Philadelphia]] on June 28, 1867. He was born David L. Witmer Jr., but at age 50 he changed his name to Lightner. Witmer was born to a devout [[Catholic]] mother and father: David Lightner, a [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] pharmacist who graduated from a Philadelphia College in 1862; and Katherine Huchel, about whom little is known. He was the eldest of four children, followed by Albert Ferree, Lilly Evelyn and Paul DeLancey. Later in life Witmer became a faculty member at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  Ferree obtained his physiology doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly Evelyn received her [[bacteriology]] [[medical degree]] in [[Berlin]], and Paul DeLancey obtained a doctoral degree in Pharmacy.{{Sfn|Thomas|2009|p=}} By the end of 1905, Witmer and his siblings had all become doctors in a range of disciplines.\n\n==Education==\n\nAs a young man, Witmer wanted a better future and a better world after the social problems he saw as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1880, Witmer and his brother Ferree enrolled in the Prep School \u201cEpiscopal Academy of Philadelphia\u201d, one of the best schools in America at the time.\n\nWitmer showed his intelligence and reasoning ability at Prep School. Witmer and two other boys were told to build a canoe, each having everything they needed to complete their task. His two schoolmates were arguing over who would build the canoe first, but Witmer thought and told the other children, \"I wish to finish last as I will learn from others' mistakes and build the best canoe.\"<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" />\n\nHe graduated with high honors at age 17.\n\nIn 1884, Witmer enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to study art, but after a couple of years he transferred to the Finance and Economy department where he obtained a [[BA degree|Bachelor's degree]] in 1888 aged 20.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\">{{cite web|last=Grassetti|first=Stevie|title=Biography for Lightner Witmer|url=https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=7081|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=8 May 2013|date=2007}}</ref> During his freshman year, he was chosen as the class president and earned a reputation as an outstanding student. After a stint as a teacher, Witmer decided to return to the University of Pennsylvania for his graduate studies in political science.{{Sfn|McReynolds|1996|p=}}\n\n==Rugby Academy==\n\nDuring the fall of 1888, Witmer was offered a job as an instructor at Rugby Academy, a male secondary school. He taught [[History]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nWhile he was teaching at the academy, Witmer noticed that a 14-year-old student who wished to go to college had extreme difficulties in differentiating sounds, as well as other speech problems that might today be called [[dyslexia]]. Witmer decided to help him to correct his problem; the child progressed satisfactorily and was able to continue studying, eventually enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Witmer|1907|p=}} This success made Witmer believe that children with learning difficulties could satisfactorily engage in education with support, dedication and special education.\n\nThe following year, Witmer decided to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania and was accepted into the Philosophy department. He intended to study [[law]] and to work towards an advanced degree in political science.\n\n==Career==\n\n'''James McKeen Cattell and the Experimental Psychological Lab'''\n\n{{One source section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile at Pennsylvania he was introduced to experimental psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]], who inspired him to begin studying in the emerging field of psychology. [[George Stuart Fullerton|George Fullerton]], a member of The University brought Cattell to join the faculty of the University. At this time, Cattell was known as one of the best-trained psychologists, educated by influential psychologist, [[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]]. Witmer accepted Fullerton's offer to become Cattell's assistant. He decided to resign from the Rugby Academy and attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWitmer and Cattell worked together to found an experimental psychology lab with the purpose of studying individual differences by examining a range of subjects.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" /> Witmer's main lab tasks were to gather data on individual differences in reaction times. Through these he gained knowledge of psychological experiments. While at the lab, Witmer published a manual that explained how [[experimental psychology]] should be properly conducted. Witmer intended to get his [[doctoral degree]] under Cattell's supervision, but Cattell suddenly left the university (effectively abandoning his students and laboratory), to obtain a higher paying position at [[Columbia University]].  Witmer also left in search of a new teacher.\n\n'''Under Wundt's Supervision'''\n\nCattell helped Witmer to get a job as assistant to [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]] in 1891, also taking classes with Oswald Kulpe and Ludwig Strumpel. Historians have found no letters written by him to colleagues while under Wundt's supervision. However, it is said that while Witmer was Wundt's assistant, they had several disagreements. One of those disputes was that Witmer desired to continue working on the study of reaction times he had previously started with James Cattell, but Wundt insisted that they should study the aesthetic value of different visual forms, and other branches of psychology such as [[educational psychology]] and [[developmental psychology]]. Witmer obtained his doctoral diploma in 1892 from Wundt.{{sfn|McReynolds|1996}}\n\n'''Return to Pennsylvania'''\n\nIn 1892, Witmer left Germany and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the Director of The Laboratory of Psychology. He was interested in teaching [[Child Psychology]] and taught several different courses. He also began conducting research on individual differences in sensory-perceptual variables and presented papers in experimental psychology. In 1896, he taught public school teachers at the University. During March of that year, a special case was brought before him: a 14-year-old student was having extreme difficulties learning to spell, yet was quite able and excelled in other subjects. This case offered a special challenge to Witmer, and was in line with his developing view that psychology should be of practical benefit. He soon began remedial work with the youth. Needing a workspace, Witmer established the first psychological clinic, at the University.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}} During 1896, he presented a plan of organization for practical work in psychology to the [[American Psychological Association]], in which he used and explained the term \"[[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]]\" for the first time.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" />\n\nIn 1902, he started advising graduate students and published a laboratory manual.\n\nHe married Emma Repplier, a prominent graduate from the [[Agnes Irwin School]], in 1904. She was a writer who worked for the [[American Philosophical Society]], to which both she and Witmer belonged.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}}\n\nIn 1908, he established and staffed a small private residential school near [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]], an institution dedicated to the care and treatment of retarded and troubled children. Later, he established a similar, but larger facility in [[Devon, Pennsylvania]].\n\nHe founded the world's first speech clinic in 1914.\n\n==American Psychological Association==\n\nBy 1896, Witmer, [[Stanley Hall]], [[William James]] and Cattell decided to become members of a new association for psychology professionals, during a meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). Witmer and other experimental colleagues proposed that the APA should accept only psychological papers, be separated from the American Philosophical Association, and have a better selection process for choosing new members. These proposals caused disagreements among APA members, because many of the current members did not want the field to separate from philosophy. Their proposals were ignored, so Witmer attempted to start a new society with Hall, exclusively for experimental psychologists, but Hall refused. In 1904 [[Edward B. Titchener]] accepted Witmer's proposal to separate Psychology from Philosophy, and decided to abandon the APA society and help Witmer create a society solely for experimental psychologists.\n\nWitmer told Titchener that the association should be only for men, and that women should be excluded, because they were too emotional when talking about scientific issues.{{sfn|Thomas |2009|p=7}} He eventually changed his attitude, and decided to teach female students; accepted women to work at his clinic, and later appointed a woman to manage it.\n\nWitmer wrote and published articles to the APA. In one article, \"The Organization of Practical Work in Psychology\", he expressed his desire to assist children academically and described a plan for organised education. He proposed that schools should become more involved with their students' classes and grades, that schools should have better educational equipment, and that faculty members should receive teaching reflecting psychological findings.{{Sfn|Routh|1996|p=}}\n\n==First psychological clinic==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nWitmer opened the first Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1886, with the purpose of studying children who had either learning or behavior problems. Witmer's main participants were children who attended public schools from [[Philadelphia]] and surrounding areas, and who were brought to the clinic by their teachers or parents.  Witmer's clinic was appreciated by many, as it proactively employed psychology. In the clinic, Witmer regularly dealt with issues such as speech difficulties, sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, hyperactivity and refusal to stay in school. Every child was given a complete mental and physical examination, which often ruled out physiological symptoms. His method of improving children with psychological problems involved breaking down information to a level that they could understand. He would focus on particular problems and work with the child in that area, often improving several areas at once.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}\n\nIn 1907 Witmer founded the journal ''The Psychological Clinic''. In its first issue, he published the article \"Clinical Psychology\", which explained its definition in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>Although clinical psychology is clearly related to medicine, it is quite as closely related to sociology and pedagogy... An abundance of material for scientific study fails to be utilized, because the interest of psychologists is elsewhere engaged, and those in constant touch with the actual phenomena do not possess the training necessary to make the experience and observation of scientific value...I have borrowed the word \"clinical\" from medicine, because it is the term I can find to indicate the character of the method which I deem necessary for this work.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}</blockquote>\n\nWitmer's \"Clinical Psychology\" was published and got a lot of attention, because it dealt with the study of individual children. In his article, Witmer presented the idea that all kinds of children (smart or mentally retarded) could reach their full potential with help. He included definitions of retardation using two different terms: \"physiological retardation\" referred to individuals who had not acquired a normal development for their chronological ages, whereas the other term, \"pedagogical retardation\", referred to children who did not develop their full capacities when they reached adulthood.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}\n\nIn the first issue of ''The Psychological Clinic'', he criticized some of his colleagues and their departments because they had rejected ideas he proposed to the American Psychological Association.{{sfn|Thomas|2009|p= 8}} In 1908, in a later issue of his journal, he criticized William James for what he felt was his unscientific attitude, calling James \"the spoiled child of American Psychology\".{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}}\n\nWitmer always defended his ideas and beliefs, even if it seemed that he did not care about other points of view. This and other disagreements caused Witmer to lose the friendship of his colleagues, who decided not to attend Witmer's meetings.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nWitmer also attacked Harvard University for using the theory of introspection and teaching psychology incorrectly, since Witmer also refused the idea theory introspection and did not care much for pure experimental psychology.{{Clarify|reason=What does that sentence mean?|date=July 2017}} He also criticized \"Intelligence Tests\" and encouraged his students not to trust them, because he thought those tests only gave a measure of the individual's efficiency, nothing else. He thought that people should not be referred to as normal or abnormal due to the results of such tests, as one could then say that an individual was \"normal\" or \"abnormal\", depending on if, for example, he or she knew how write and read properly.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother of Witmer's studies involved apes. He compared them with children, and taught them how to articulate some elements of spoken language, but their efforts to learn were not successful. However, one day Witmer attended a performance, and noticed that a monkey was able to do some things human beings could do, such as reading and writing, after being instructed to do such things.\n\nWitmer's studies of individual behavior extended to gifted children. In 1900 in his ''The Restoration of Children of the Slums'' described Witmer's beliefs that criminal behavior was not hereditary. Instead, he thought [[criminal behavior]] was caused due to environmental facts.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1911 Witmer supported a bill in the state of Pennsylvania to sterilize severely retarded people, with the purpose of minimizing their offspring. In 1912 he traveled to Italy to study pedagogical methods with special children.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Clinical psychology==\n\nIn his 1896 APA paper, cited to be the first instance of his use and explanation of the term \"Clinical Psychology,\" Witmer outlined four main goals for his new discipline.{{sfn|Baker|1988|p=}} Firstly, it was to focus on the investigation of mental and moral retardation by means of statistical and clinical methods. Secondly, clinical psychology as a discipline was to establish more psychological clinics and hospitals specifically for children suffering from retardation or physical defects that inhibit academic progress. The discipline was to focus on the creation of opportunities for those in other disciplines, such as teaching, medicine and social work to observe and work with retarded and normal children. Witmer's fourth goal was to train more psychologist to become expert in working with mentally and/or morally retarded clients. In this same paper, Witmer outlined the main concern of clinical psychology: that the discipline focus on active clinical intervention for the purpose of the restoration and treatment of mentally or morally disabled individuals. According to Witmer, for clinical psychology to actually be of any worth, it needed to help and improve clients' mental health and well-being.\n\nAs clinical psychology was the first discipline in psychology that attempted to apply the principles of scientific psychology to diagnostic and remedial work, it required its own techniques and procedures. Clinical psychology's original methodologies were highly practical and problem-oriented, and were developed solely by Witmer.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}} His early work used a hands-on approach to observation and interviews, emphasizing one-on-one interaction between client and clinician.{{Sfn|Fagan|1996|p=}}\n\nAdditionally, emphasis was placed on the ability of the clinician to be able to work with their clients in a professional, yet personal way. Witmer highlighted the concept of treating each client as an individual, and not simply as a physical manifestation of their problem or a phenomenon to be observed and explained. He emphasized researching each client's personal background history, as he held that it would allow clinicians to better and more fully understand their situation. He was one of the first psychologists to accept that a client's problems could have environmental as well as hereditary factors, and because of this, he emphasized the importance that treatment should not end with returning the client into the environment from which their physical, mental, or moral problem originated unless something had been done to change it.\n\nAlthough the treatment programs Witmer created for clinical psychology were systematic, they were constantly revised and implemented new treatment methods as the client improved or problems arose. Treatment involved weekly visits to the clinic to ould continue until either the problem was resolved, or the client, or the client's parent/guardian, decided to end it. Witmer's treatment programs were not limited to the clinic in which they took place; he emphasized the importance of ongoing remediation in between treatment sessions and after treatment had officially ended. To this end Witmer made a point to provide direct advice and consultation to both the client and their caregivers on their living environment and other aspects of their lives in order to improve their problems or disabilities. Many of Witmer's original methodologies still exist in modern-day clinical psychology.\n\n==Other contributions==\n\nWitmer was responsible for major advancements in the field of school psychology and was cited as the founder of this discipline.{{sfn|Fagan|1996}} Witmer was the first psychologist to undertake and focus, on the treatment of those with mental, physical or moral handicaps with the goal of improving their deficits. He ensured that the treatment of children suffering from a deficit impairing their academic success would be a major focus of clinical psychology when he made one of the discipline's main goals the creation of psychological clinics and hospitals to treat impaired children.\n\nWitmer was the first psychologist to realize teachers' integral role and began offering classes at his clinic for teachers. He opened up his clinic to those in medicine and social work and gave them the opportunity to observe and work with normal and impaired children. This allowed those who interacted with children a chance to work with them in a therapeutic environment. By mixing normal and handicapped children, Witmer gave these professionals the chance to directly observe the differences between the two groups for themselves. He offered these professionals courses that demonstrated how to practically apply his clinical methods. This helped the other disciplines to see the importance of working with disabled children.\n\n'''Final days'''\n\nBy 1917, Witmer joined the [[Red Cross]]. His main task was to help to rehabilitate [[homeless]] people who were war victims.

He introduced the term \"[[Clinical Psychology|clinical psychology\"]] and is often credited with founding the field that it describes. Witmer created the world's first \"psychological clinic\" at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1896, including the first journal of clinical psychology and the first clinical hospital school in 1907.\n\nWitmer contributed to numerous branches of [[psychology]] including [[school psychology]]. He contributed to the field of [[special education]].\n\nLittle is known about Witmer's life. He is described as an [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] and private person.\n\n==Early life==\n{{One source section|date=September 2017}}\nWitmer was born in [[Philadelphia]] on June 28, 1867. He was born David L. Witmer Jr., but at age 50 he changed his name to Lightner. Witmer was born to a devout [[Catholic]] mother and father: David Lightner, a [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]] pharmacist who graduated from a Philadelphia College in 1862; and Katherine Huchel, about whom little is known. He was the eldest of four children, followed by Albert Ferree, Lilly Evelyn and Paul DeLancey. Later in life Witmer became a faculty member at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].  Ferree obtained his physiology doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania, Lilly Evelyn received her [[bacteriology]] [[medical degree]] in [[Berlin]], and Paul DeLancey obtained a doctoral degree in Pharmacy.{{Sfn|Thomas|2009|p=}} By the end of 1905, Witmer and his siblings had all become doctors in a range of disciplines.\n\n==Education==\n\nAs a young man, Witmer wanted a better future and a better world after the social problems he saw as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In 1880, Witmer and his brother Ferree enrolled in the Prep School \u201cEpiscopal Academy of Philadelphia\u201d, one of the best schools in America at the time.\n\nWitmer showed his intelligence and reasoning ability at Prep School. Witmer and two other boys were told to build a canoe, each having everything they needed to complete their task. His two schoolmates were arguing over who would build the canoe first, but Witmer thought and told the other children, \"I wish to finish last as I will learn from others' mistakes and build the best canoe.\"<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" />\n\nHe graduated with high honors at age 17.\n\nIn 1884, Witmer enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania to study art, but after a couple of years he transferred to the Finance and Economy department where he obtained a [[BA degree|Bachelor's degree]] in 1888 aged 20.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\">{{cite web|last=Grassetti|first=Stevie|title=Biography for Lightner Witmer|url=https://secureapps.libraries.psu.edu/PACFTB/bios/biography.cfm?AuthorID=7081|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University|accessdate=8 May 2013|date=2007}}</ref> During his freshman year, he was chosen as the class president and earned a reputation as an outstanding student. After a stint as a teacher, Witmer decided to return to the University of Pennsylvania for his graduate studies in political science.{{Sfn|McReynolds|1996|p=}}\n\n==Rugby Academy==\n\nDuring the fall of 1888, Witmer was offered a job as an instructor at Rugby Academy, a male secondary school. He taught [[History]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nWhile he was teaching at the academy, Witmer noticed that a 14-year-old student who wished to go to college had extreme difficulties in differentiating sounds, as well as other speech problems that might today be called [[dyslexia]]. Witmer decided to help him to correct his problem; the child progressed satisfactorily and was able to continue studying, eventually enrolling at the University of Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Witmer|1907|p=}} This success made Witmer believe that children with learning difficulties could satisfactorily engage in education with support, dedication and special education.\n\nThe following year, Witmer decided to attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania and was accepted into the Philosophy department. He intended to study [[law]] and to work towards an advanced degree in political science.\n\n==Career==\n\n'''James McKeen Cattell and the Experimental Psychological Lab'''\n\n{{One source section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWhile at Pennsylvania he was introduced to experimental psychologist [[James McKeen Cattell]], who inspired him to begin studying in the emerging field of psychology. [[George Stuart Fullerton|George Fullerton]], a member of The University brought Cattell to join the faculty of the University. At this time, Cattell was known as one of the best-trained psychologists, educated by influential psychologist, [[Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt]]. Witmer accepted Fullerton's offer to become Cattell's assistant. He decided to resign from the Rugby Academy and attend graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWitmer and Cattell worked together to found an experimental psychology lab with the purpose of studying individual differences by examining a range of subjects.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" /> Witmer's main lab tasks were to gather data on individual differences in reaction times. Through these he gained knowledge of psychological experiments. While at the lab, Witmer published a manual that explained how [[experimental psychology]] should be properly conducted. Witmer intended to get his [[doctoral degree]] under Cattell's supervision, but Cattell suddenly left the university (effectively abandoning his students and laboratory), to obtain a higher paying position at [[Columbia University]].  Witmer also left in search of a new teacher.\n\n'''Under Wundt's Supervision'''\n\nCattell helped Witmer to get a job as assistant to [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]] in 1891, also taking classes with Oswald Kulpe and Ludwig Strumpel. Historians have found no letters written by him to colleagues while under Wundt's supervision. However, it is said that while Witmer was Wundt's assistant, they had several disagreements. One of those disputes was that Witmer desired to continue working on the study of reaction times he had previously started with James Cattell, but Wundt insisted that they should study the aesthetic value of different visual forms, and other branches of psychology such as [[educational psychology]] and [[developmental psychology]]. Witmer obtained his doctoral diploma in 1892 from Wundt.{{sfn|McReynolds|1996}}\n\n'''Return to Pennsylvania'''\n\nIn 1892, Witmer left Germany and returned to the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the Director of The Laboratory of Psychology. He was interested in teaching [[Child Psychology]] and taught several different courses. He also began conducting research on individual differences in sensory-perceptual variables and presented papers in experimental psychology. In 1896, he taught public school teachers at the University. During March of that year, a special case was brought before him: a 14-year-old student was having extreme difficulties learning to spell, yet was quite able and excelled in other subjects. This case offered a special challenge to Witmer, and was in line with his developing view that psychology should be of practical benefit. He soon began remedial work with the youth. Needing a workspace, Witmer established the first psychological clinic, at the University.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}} During 1896, he presented a plan of organization for practical work in psychology to the [[American Psychological Association]], in which he used and explained the term \"[[Clinical psychology|Clinical Psychology]]\" for the first time.<ref name=\"Grassetti2007\" />\n\nIn 1902, he started advising graduate students and published a laboratory manual.\n\nHe married Emma Repplier, a prominent graduate from the [[Agnes Irwin School]], in 1904. She was a writer who worked for the [[American Philosophical Society]], to which both she and Witmer belonged.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}}\n\nIn 1908, he established and staffed a small private residential school near [[Wallingford, Pennsylvania]], an institution dedicated to the care and treatment of retarded and troubled children. Later, he established a similar, but larger facility in [[Devon, Pennsylvania]].\n\nHe founded the world's first speech clinic in 1914.\n\n==American Psychological Association==\n\nBy 1896, Witmer, [[Stanley Hall]], [[William James]] and Cattell decided to become members of a new association for psychology professionals, during a meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA). Witmer and other experimental colleagues proposed that the APA should accept only psychological papers, be separated from the American Philosophical Association, and have a better selection process for choosing new members. These proposals caused disagreements among APA members, because many of the current members did not want the field to separate from philosophy. Their proposals were ignored, so Witmer attempted to start a new society with Hall, exclusively for experimental psychologists, but Hall refused. In 1904 [[Edward B. Titchener]] accepted Witmer's proposal to separate Psychology from Philosophy, and decided to abandon the APA society and help Witmer create a society solely for experimental psychologists.\n\nWitmer told Titchener that the association should be only for men, and that women should be excluded, because they were too emotional when talking about scientific issues.{{sfn|Thomas |2009|p=7}} He eventually changed his attitude, and decided to teach female students; accepted women to work at his clinic, and later appointed a woman to manage it.\n\nWitmer wrote and published articles to the APA. In one article, \"The Organization of Practical Work in Psychology\", he expressed his desire to assist children academically and described a plan for organised education. He proposed that schools should become more involved with their students' classes and grades, that schools should have better educational equipment, and that faculty members should receive teaching reflecting psychological findings.{{Sfn|Routh|1996|p=}}\n\n==First psychological clinic==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2012}}\nWitmer opened the first Psychological Clinic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1886, with the purpose of studying children who had either learning or behavior problems. Witmer's main participants were children who attended public schools from [[Philadelphia]] and surrounding areas, and who were brought to the clinic by their teachers or parents.  Witmer's clinic was appreciated by many, as it proactively employed psychology. In the clinic, Witmer regularly dealt with issues such as speech difficulties, sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, hyperactivity and refusal to stay in school. Every child was given a complete mental and physical examination, which often ruled out physiological symptoms. His method of improving children with psychological problems involved breaking down information to a level that they could understand. He would focus on particular problems and work with the child in that area, often improving several areas at once.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}\n\nIn 1907 Witmer founded the journal ''The Psychological Clinic''. In its first issue, he published the article \"Clinical Psychology\", which explained its definition in the following way:\n\n<blockquote>Although clinical psychology is clearly related to medicine, it is quite as closely related to sociology and pedagogy... An abundance of material for scientific study fails to be utilized, because the interest of psychologists is elsewhere engaged, and those in constant touch with the actual phenomena do not possess the training necessary to make the experience and observation of scientific value...I have borrowed the word \"clinical\" from medicine, because it is the term I can find to indicate the character of the method which I deem necessary for this work.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}</blockquote>\n\nWitmer's \"Clinical Psychology\" was published and got a lot of attention, because it dealt with the study of individual children. In his article, Witmer presented the idea that all kinds of children (smart or mentally retarded) could reach their full potential with help. He included definitions of retardation using two different terms: \"physiological retardation\" referred to individuals who had not acquired a normal development for their chronological ages, whereas the other term, \"pedagogical retardation\", referred to children who did not develop their full capacities when they reached adulthood.{{sfn|Witmer|1907}}\n\nIn the first issue of ''The Psychological Clinic'', he criticized some of his colleagues and their departments because they had rejected ideas he proposed to the American Psychological Association.{{sfn|Thomas|2009|p= 8}} In 1908, in a later issue of his journal, he criticized William James for what he felt was his unscientific attitude, calling James \"the spoiled child of American Psychology\".{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}}\n\nWitmer always defended his ideas and beliefs, even if it seemed that he did not care about other points of view. This and other disagreements caused Witmer to lose the friendship of his colleagues, who decided not to attend Witmer's meetings.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nWitmer also attacked Harvard University for using the theory of introspection and teaching psychology incorrectly, since Witmer also refused the idea theory introspection and did not care much for pure experimental psychology.{{Clarify|reason=What does that sentence mean?|date=July 2017}} He also criticized \"Intelligence Tests\" and encouraged his students not to trust them, because he thought those tests only gave a measure of the individual's efficiency, nothing else. He thought that people should not be referred to as normal or abnormal due to the results of such tests, as one could then say that an individual was \"normal\" or \"abnormal\", depending on if, for example, he or she knew how write and read properly.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nAnother of Witmer's studies involved apes. He compared them with children, and taught them how to articulate some elements of spoken language, but their efforts to learn were not successful. However, one day Witmer attended a performance, and noticed that a monkey was able to do some things human beings could do, such as reading and writing, after being instructed to do such things.\n\nWitmer's studies of individual behavior extended to gifted children. In 1900 in his ''The Restoration of Children of the Slums'' described Witmer's beliefs that criminal behavior was not hereditary. Instead, he thought [[criminal behavior]] was caused due to environmental facts.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIn 1911 Witmer supported a bill in the state of Pennsylvania to sterilize severely retarded people, with the purpose of minimizing their offspring. In 1912 he traveled to Italy to study pedagogical methods with special children.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Clinical psychology==\n\nIn his 1896 APA paper, cited to be the first instance of his use and explanation of the term \"Clinical Psychology,\" Witmer outlined four main goals for his new discipline.{{sfn|Baker|1988|p=}} Firstly, it was to focus on the investigation of mental and moral retardation by means of statistical and clinical methods. Secondly, clinical psychology as a discipline was to establish more psychological clinics and hospitals specifically for children suffering from retardation or physical defects that inhibit academic progress. The discipline was to focus on the creation of opportunities for those in other disciplines, such as teaching, medicine and social work to observe and work with retarded and normal children. Witmer's fourth goal was to train more psychologist to become expert in working with mentally and/or morally retarded clients. In this same paper, Witmer outlined the main concern of clinical psychology: that the discipline focus on active clinical intervention for the purpose of the restoration and treatment of mentally or morally disabled individuals. According to Witmer, for clinical psychology to actually be of any worth, it needed to help and improve clients' mental health and well-being.\n\nAs clinical psychology was the first discipline in psychology that attempted to apply the principles of scientific psychology to diagnostic and remedial work, it required its own techniques and procedures. Clinical psychology's original methodologies were highly practical and problem-oriented, and were developed solely by Witmer.{{sfn|McReynolds|1987}} His early work used a hands-on approach to observation and interviews, emphasizing one-on-one interaction between client and clinician.{{Sfn|Fagan|1996|p=}}\n\nAdditionally, emphasis was placed on the ability of the clinician to be able to work with their clients in a professional, yet personal way. Witmer highlighted the concept of treating each client as an individual, and not simply as a physical manifestation of their problem or a phenomenon to be observed and explained. He emphasized researching each client's personal background history, as he held that it would allow clinicians to better and more fully understand their situation. He was one of the first psychologists to accept that a client's problems could have environmental as well as hereditary factors, and because of this, he emphasized the importance that treatment should not end with returning the client into the environment from which their physical, mental, or moral problem originated unless something had been done to change it.\n\nAlthough the treatment programs Witmer created for clinical psychology were systematic, they were constantly revised and implemented new treatment methods as the client improved or problems arose. Treatment involved weekly visits to the clinic to ould continue until either the problem was resolved, or the client, or the client's parent/guardian, decided to end it. Witmer's treatment programs were not limited to the clinic in which they took place; he emphasized the importance of ongoing remediation in between treatment sessions and after treatment had officially ended. To this end Witmer made a point to provide direct advice and consultation to both the client and their caregivers on their living environment and other aspects of their lives in order to improve their problems or disabilities. Many of Witmer's original methodologies still exist in modern-day clinical psychology.\n\n==Other contributions==\n\nWitmer was responsible for major advancements in the field of school psychology and was cited as the founder of this discipline.{{sfn|Fagan|1996}} Witmer was the first psychologist to undertake and focus, on the treatment of those with mental, physical or moral handicaps with the goal of improving their deficits. He ensured that the treatment of children suffering from a deficit impairing their academic success would be a major focus of clinical psychology when he made one of the discipline's main goals the creation of psychological clinics and hospitals to treat impaired children.\n\nWitmer was the first psychologist to realize teachers' integral role and began offering classes at his clinic for teachers. He opened up his clinic to those in medicine and social work and gave them the opportunity to observe and work with normal and impaired children. This allowed those who interacted with children a chance to work with them in a therapeutic environment. By mixing normal and handicapped children, Witmer gave these professionals the chance to directly observe the differences between the two groups for themselves. He offered these professionals courses that demonstrated how to practically apply his clinical methods. This helped the other disciplines to see the importance of working with disabled children.\n\n'''Final days'''\n\nBy 1917, Witmer joined the [[Red Cross]]. His main task was to help to rehabilitate [[homeless]] people who were war victims. When he went to the United States in 1920, his mother died, followed a few years later by Titchener, and he stopped publishing.\n\nBy 1930, the University of Pennsylvania presented him with a volume called ''Clinical Psychology: Studies in Honor of Lightner Witmer''.\n\nOn July 19, 1956, at age 89, Witmer died at the hospital in [[Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania|Bryn Mawr]] from [[heart failure]].{{Sfn|McReynolds|1987|p=}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{One source section|date=September 2017}}\n\nWitmer gained little recognition outside of clinical psychology and is little talked about. Several factors are claimed to have contributed to this perception.{{sfn|Thomas|2009}}\n\nOne had to do with Witmer's personality. Within his field he was vicious, argumentative and blunt, regardless of his opponent. Witmer's targets included the American Psychological Association, mon-experimentalists, psychology as a discipline, and his colleagues.\n\nA second factor was that many of his theories were not empirically testable.

He then often failed to provide methods for testing his theories.\n\nMany of his principles, methods and ideas are basically congruent with later developments in his field, but were far from the mainstream when he offered them. At his official address in 1897, his ideas for clinical psychology produced only a few raised eyebrows.{{sfn|Thomas|2009}}\n\nWitmer was highly critical of many popular trends in psychology and society during his career.{{sfn|Thomas|2009}} For example, he directly opposed popular education methods of his time, which focused on mass instruction. Witmer argued that education required personalization and a focus on students as individuals. He was highly critical of intelligence tests, which he claimed measured efficiency, rather than intelligence. He saw intelligence as having both hereditary and environmental components.\n\n==Works==\n\n* ''The Association Value of Three-Place Consonant Syllables''.
