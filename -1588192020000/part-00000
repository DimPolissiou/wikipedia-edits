Based in [[New York City]], White Zombie was originally a [[noise rock]] band, and was known for its later heavy metal-oriented sound. Their best-known songs include \"[[Thunder Kiss '65]]\", \"[[Black Sunshine]]\" and \"[[More Human than Human]]\". The group officially disbanded in 1998. In 2000, White Zombie was included on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 56.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists: 1-50 |publisher=Rock On The Net |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early career and independent releases (1985\u20131986)===\nWhite Zombie was co-founded by [[Rob Zombie]], after coming up with the band idea in 1985 while attending [[Parsons School of Design]] in his junior year. Zombie's girlfriend at the time, [[Sean Yseult]], was the other co-founder. She had been playing the [[Farfisa]] keyboard in the band LIFE with [[Ivan de Prume]], but the band soon broke up. [[Paul Kostabi|Ena Kostabi]] owned a [[recording studio]], which he would rent out to different bands. When he met Yseult, she asked if he could teach her to play bass. They then recruited Peter Landau to play drums and began to write and record songs. White Zombie's first release, ''[[Gods on Voodoo Moon]]'', was an [[Extended play|EP]] and was recorded on October 18, 1985. It was released under the band's own label [[Silent Explosion]], under which they would release most of their early work. Only 300 copies were pressed, of which only 100 were sold; the band members still retain possession of the remaining 200.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 1986, Zombie hired [[Tim Jeffs]], his Parsons School of Design roommate, to play guitar to replace Ena Kostabi, and Yseult brought in de Prume from their days in the band LIFE as the replacement for Landau. It was at this time the band started touring, making their live performance debut at [[CBGB]] on April 28, 1986.<ref>Tim Jeffs' Early White Zombie Biography. cited July 6, 2009.</ref><ref>Yseult, Sean. \"CBGB's\". ''I'm in the Band''. 2010. p. 8, cited January 9, 2011</ref> White Zombie released their second EP, ''[[Pig Heaven]]'', that year. The release contained two songs, \"Pig Heaven\" and \"Slaughter the Grey\". The EP was recorded at 6/8 Studios in NoHo in New York City. Other songs that were recorded during the session but never released were titled \"Follow Wild\", \"Rain Insane\", \"Paradise Fireball\", and \"Red River Flow\". After touring for a year in the band, Tim Jeffs left and was replaced by [[Tom Guay]], often known as Tom Five. The band released a second pressing of ''Pig Heaven'' with different cover art, but retained the same recording with Jeffs on guitar. Only 500 copies of each pressing were released on vinyl.\n\n===First two albums (1987\u20131990)===\nIn 1987, the band released their third EP, ''[[Psycho-Head Blowout]]''. Later that year, the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Soul-Crusher]]'', which was their first release to feature sound clips from movies in the songs, a signature that would continue for the remainder of the band's lifespan.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| page= 1060\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the band signed to [[Caroline Records]], permanently discontinuing their own indie label. After completing their first U.S. tour in June 1988, Tom Guay was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by John Ricci in July 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rzr.online.fr/docs/zombie/drawings.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212220010/http://rzr.online.fr/docs/zombie/drawings.htm |archive-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Make Them Die Slowly (album)|Make Them Die Slowly]]'', was released in February 1989.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album was a musical shift for White Zombie. While their previous releases had been strictly punk-influenced noise rock, ''Make Them Die Slowly'' has more of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is also the first album crediting \"Rob Zombie\" instead of his previous [[stage name]], \"Rob 'Dirt' Straker\".\n\nRicci's [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] severely affected his ability to play guitar, forcing him to leave the band when ''Make Them Die Slowly'' was finished. [[Jay Noel Yuenger|Jay \"J\" Yuenger]] replaced him before the album's release, affecting their future sound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inyoureye.com/secure/whitezom/white_1.cfm |title=\"J. from White Zombie Speaks!\" |accessdate=August 20, 2003 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030820103658/http://www.inyoureye.com/secure/whitezom/white_1.cfm |archivedate=August 20, 2003 }}, cited June 12, 2010</ref> One of the most obvious examples of this direction is the difference between the songs \"Disaster Blaster\" on ''Make Them Die Slowly'' and the re-worked version, \"Disaster Blaster II\", on the ''[[God of Thunder (album)|God of Thunder]]'' EP.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Major label years, mainstream success, and breakup (1991\u20131998)===\nAfter searching for a record label and being turned down multiple times, the band turned toward [[RCA Records]]. However, Zombie opted for a [[recording contract]] with [[Geffen Records]]. Michael Alago, a representative of Geffen, became interested after hearing ''God of Thunder'' and watched one of their shows at [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]] and liked them, mostly for their song \"Soul-Crusher\". The band produced a [[demo (music)|demo]] with the help of [[J. G. Thirlwell]] of [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] and were signed to Geffen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/rob_zombie_i_find_it_distracting_to_hear_my_own_music.html|title=Rob Zombie: 'I Find It Distracting To Hear My Own Music' &#124; Music News @|website=Ultimate-guitar.com|accessdate=June 15, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073445/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/rob_zombie_i_find_it_distracting_to_hear_my_own_music.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 17, 1992, White Zombie released ''[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One]]'', the album which launched them into mainstream recognition. White Zombie began a two-and-a-half-year-long tour for the album soon after its release, during which the band gained a large [[cult following]]. During the tour, [[Ivan de Prume]] left the band to pursue a successful career as a producer/engineer as well as drummer/percussionist and opened his own studio, Burningsound. He was replaced by Phil Buerstatte. The [[music video]] for the song \"[[Thunder Kiss '65]]\" went into heavy rotation on [[MTV]] in 1993. The TV show ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' began featuring their music videos, boosting the band's popularity.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> By the end of 1993, the album had been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. By the time the tour ended in December 1994, Zombie and Yseult had broken up, and ''La Sexorcisto'' had gone [[RIAA certification|platinum]]. Due to artistic differences, Buerstatte was let go, and [[John Tempesta]] (who had previously worked with [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]) was hired to record White Zombie's second major label album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1995, ''[[Astro-Creep: 2000 \u2013 Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head|Astro Creep: 2000]]'' was released, featuring the hit single \"[[More Human than Human]]\". In 1996, an album of remixes was released under the title ''[[Supersexy Swingin' Sounds]]''. After making one last song for the 1996 film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'', titled \"Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls\", White Zombie broke up in September 1998.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===After disbanding (1998\u2013present)===\nAfter the breakup of White Zombie, Sean Yseult joined the [[surf rock]] band The Famous Monsters, and started playing bass for horror-themed [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]-based band, Rock City Morgue. She also briefly played bass for [[The Cramps]].\n\nTempesta continued his musical relationship with Zombie, drumming for him on his first two solo albums, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]'' and ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]''. He is no longer with Zombie, and has gone on to play for [[Scum of the Earth (band)|Scum of the Earth]]. Tempesta has toured with Testament (as shown on Testament's DVD, ''Live In London''). On February 14, 2006, he was hired as the new drummer for [[The Cult]], before which he played with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]].\n\n[[Jay Noel Yuenger|J.]] produced records for [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]] and [[New York City|New York]]-based Puny Human.\n\nIn July 2006, original members Tom Five and de Prume reunited to perform with de Prume's band, Healer, a middle eastern infused metal band, for several concerts in Southern California for The Vans [[Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|title=Original WHITE ZOMBIE Members Team Up For VANS WARPED TOUR Appearance|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|date=July 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|archivedate=June 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> De Prume continues to write and record music with Healer, as well as recording, producing and engineering for special projects in his studio, Burningsound. His drums and percussion work can also be heard on Sony's \"Ghost Rider\" score. In 2009, de Prume began hosting the weekly radio show, \"Metalopolis\". His studio guests have included [[Rob Halford]], [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Max Cavalera]], [[Vinnie Paul]] and [[Tom Araya]]. De Prume is also a member of the band KREEP, and has completed a West Coast tour in spring 2010, and is planning an East Coast tour in fall 2010.\n\nIn November 2008, Geffen/UME released ''[[Let Sleeping Corpses Lie]]'', a [[boxed set]] which includes sixty four tracks featuring every White Zombie album and EP (except the remix albums), all remastered. The package also contained nine music videos (including their breakthrough Grammy-nominated hit \"Thunder Kiss '65\"), and ten live performances.

In June 2011, in an interview with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine, he was asked why White Zombie split up, in which he replied: \"It had run its course. Success is a big thing that you can never plan for, because it affects everybody differently. I don't want to blame myself or anyone else in the band \u2014 it's just that the band didn't work anymore. Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it all fall apart, I thought: 'Let's just end it on a high point'\". Zombie also stated earlier in 2011 that a White Zombie reunion would never happen and he had not been in contact with any members of the band \"except [[John Tempesta]] in about 15 years.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-says-white-zombie-will-never-reunite/|title=ROB ZOMBIE Says WHITE ZOMBIE Will Never Reunite|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, Yseult mirrored his comments, saying that with the '98 split, \"[she] was definitely ready for [the band] to be over with\", and that she stayed in touch with most other band members aside from Zombie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sean-yseult-is-not-upset-that-white-zombie-ended/|title=SEAN YSEULT Is Not Upset That WHITE ZOMBIE Ended|date=October 9, 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, former drummer Phil Buerstatte died.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Marc Hogan|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/05/phil-buerstatte-white-zombie-drummer-has-died/|title=Phil Buerstatte, Former White Zombie Drummer, Dead at 44|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/https://www.spin.com/2013/05/phil-buerstatte-white-zombie-drummer-has-died/|archivedate=June 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortly after his death, he was impersonated by con-artist Loren Dean Breknridge, who was wanted for defrauding rehab centers across the nation, as well as scamming character actor [[Loren Dean]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\u2018White Zombie\u2019 impostor sentenced for rehab frauds in Novato, Sausalito |url=https://www.marinij.com/2013/05/24/white-zombie-impostor-sentenced-for-rehab-frauds-in-novato-sausalito/ |publisher=Marin Independent Journal}}</ref>\n\nIn a November 2015 interview with Artisan News, Yseult stated that a White Zombie vinyl box set was due for release in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-white-zombie-vinyl-box-set-due-in-2016/|title=New White Zombie Vinyl Box Set Due In 2016 - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref> On February 16, 2016, ''[[It Came From N.Y.C.]]'' was confirmed for a June 3 release via the Numero Group.

Based in [[New York City]], White Zombie was originally a [[noise rock]] band, and was known for its later heavy metal-oriented sound. Their best-known songs include \"[[Thunder Kiss '65]]\", \"[[Black Sunshine]]\" and \"[[More Human than Human]]\". The group officially disbanded in 1998. In 2000, White Zombie was included on [[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock, ranking at No. 56.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/vh1hardrock.htm |title=VH1: 100 Greatest Hard Rock Artists: 1-50 |publisher=Rock On The Net |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early career and independent releases (1985\u20131986)===\nWhite Zombie was co-founded by [[Rob Zombie]], after coming up with the band idea in 1985 while attending [[Parsons School of Design]] in his junior year. Zombie's girlfriend at the time, [[Sean Yseult]], was the other co-founder. She had been playing the [[Farfisa]] keyboard in the band LIFE with [[Ivan de Prume]], but the band soon broke up. [[Paul Kostabi|Ena Kostabi]] owned a [[recording studio]], which he would rent out to different bands. When he met Yseult, she asked if he could teach her to play bass. They then recruited Peter Landau to play drums and began to write and record songs. White Zombie's first release, ''[[Gods on Voodoo Moon]]'', was an [[Extended play|EP]] and was recorded on October 18, 1985. It was released under the band's own label [[Silent Explosion]], under which they would release most of their early work. Only 300 copies were pressed, of which only 100 were sold; the band members still retain possession of the remaining 200.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn 1986, Zombie hired [[Tim Jeffs]], his Parsons School of Design roommate, to play guitar to replace Ena Kostabi, and Yseult brought in de Prume from their days in the band LIFE as the replacement for Landau. It was at this time the band started touring, making their live performance debut at [[CBGB]] on April 28, 1986.<ref>Tim Jeffs' Early White Zombie Biography. cited July 6, 2009.</ref><ref>Yseult, Sean. \"CBGB's\". ''I'm in the Band''. 2010. p. 8, cited January 9, 2011</ref> White Zombie released their second EP, ''[[Pig Heaven]]'', that year. The release contained two songs, \"Pig Heaven\" and \"Slaughter the Grey\". The EP was recorded at 6/8 Studios in NoHo in New York City. Other songs that were recorded during the session but never released were titled \"Follow Wild\", \"Rain Insane\", \"Paradise Fireball\", and \"Red River Flow\". After touring for a year in the band, Tim Jeffs left and was replaced by [[Tom Guay]], often known as Tom Five. The band released a second pressing of ''Pig Heaven'' with different cover art, but retained the same recording with Jeffs on guitar. Only 500 copies of each pressing were released on vinyl.\n\n===First two albums (1987\u20131990)===\nIn 1987, the band released their third EP, ''[[Psycho-Head Blowout]]''. Later that year, the band released their first full-length album, ''[[Soul-Crusher]]'', which was their first release to feature sound clips from movies in the songs, a signature that would continue for the remainder of the band's lifespan.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book\n| first= Martin C.\n| last= Strong\n| year= 2000\n| title= The Great Rock Discography\n| edition= 5th\n| publisher= Mojo Books\n| location= Edinburgh\n| page= 1060\n| isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the band signed to [[Caroline Records]], permanently discontinuing their own indie label. After completing their first U.S. tour in June 1988, Tom Guay was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by John Ricci in July 1988.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://rzr.online.fr/docs/zombie/drawings.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212220010/http://rzr.online.fr/docs/zombie/drawings.htm |archive-date=2012-02-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their second album, ''[[Make Them Die Slowly (album)|Make Them Die Slowly]]'', was released in February 1989.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album was a musical shift for White Zombie. While their previous releases had been strictly punk-influenced noise rock, ''Make Them Die Slowly'' has more of a [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] sound.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This is also the first album crediting \"Rob Zombie\" instead of his previous [[stage name]], \"Rob 'Dirt' Straker\".\n\nRicci's [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] severely affected his ability to play guitar, forcing him to leave the band when ''Make Them Die Slowly'' was finished. [[Jay Noel Yuenger|Jay \"J\" Yuenger]] replaced him before the album's release, affecting their future sound.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inyoureye.com/secure/whitezom/white_1.cfm |title=\"J. from White Zombie Speaks!\" |accessdate=August 20, 2003 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030820103658/http://www.inyoureye.com/secure/whitezom/white_1.cfm |archivedate=August 20, 2003 }}, cited June 12, 2010</ref> One of the most obvious examples of this direction is the difference between the songs \"Disaster Blaster\" on ''Make Them Die Slowly'' and the re-worked version, \"Disaster Blaster II\", on the ''[[God of Thunder (album)|God of Thunder]]'' EP.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n===Major label years, mainstream success, and breakup (1991\u20131998)===\nAfter searching for a record label and being turned down multiple times, the band turned toward [[RCA Records]]. However, Zombie opted for a [[recording contract]] with [[Geffen Records]]. Michael Alago, a representative of Geffen, became interested after hearing ''God of Thunder'' and watched one of their shows at [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]] and liked them, mostly for their song \"Soul-Crusher\". The band produced a [[demo (music)|demo]] with the help of [[J. G. Thirlwell]] of [[Foetus (band)|Foetus]] and were signed to Geffen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/rob_zombie_i_find_it_distracting_to_hear_my_own_music.html|title=Rob Zombie: 'I Find It Distracting To Hear My Own Music' &#124; Music News @|website=Ultimate-guitar.com|accessdate=June 15, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305073445/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/rob_zombie_i_find_it_distracting_to_hear_my_own_music.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn March 17, 1992, White Zombie released ''[[La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume One]]'', the album which launched them into mainstream recognition. White Zombie began a two-and-a-half-year-long tour for the album soon after its release, during which the band gained a large [[cult following]]. During the tour, [[Ivan de Prume]] left the band to pursue a successful career as a producer/engineer as well as drummer/percussionist and opened his own studio, Burningsound. He was replaced by Phil Buerstatte. The [[music video]] for the song \"[[Thunder Kiss '65]]\" went into heavy rotation on [[MTV]] in 1993. The TV show ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'' began featuring their music videos, boosting the band's popularity.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> By the end of 1993, the album had been certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] by the [[RIAA]]. By the time the tour ended in December 1994, Zombie and Yseult had broken up, and ''La Sexorcisto'' had gone [[RIAA certification|platinum]]. Due to artistic differences, Buerstatte was let go, and [[John Tempesta]] (who had previously worked with [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]) was hired to record White Zombie's second major label album.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> In 1995, ''[[Astro-Creep: 2000 \u2013 Songs of Love, Destruction and Other Synthetic Delusions of the Electric Head|Astro Creep: 2000]]'' was released, featuring the hit single \"[[More Human than Human]]\". In 1996, an album of remixes was released under the title ''[[Supersexy Swingin' Sounds]]''. After making one last song for the 1996 film ''[[Beavis and Butt-head Do America]]'', titled \"Ratfinks, Suicide Tanks and Cannibal Girls\", White Zombie broke up in September 1998.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===After disbanding (1998\u2013present)===\nAfter the breakup of White Zombie, Sean Yseult joined the [[surf rock]] band The Famous Monsters, and started playing bass for horror-themed [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]-based band, Rock City Morgue. She also briefly played bass for [[The Cramps]].\n\nTempesta continued his musical relationship with Zombie, drumming for him on his first two solo albums, ''[[Hellbilly Deluxe]]'' and ''[[The Sinister Urge (album)|The Sinister Urge]]''. He is no longer with Zombie, and has gone on to play for [[Scum of the Earth (band)|Scum of the Earth]]. Tempesta has toured with Testament (as shown on Testament's DVD, ''Live In London''). On February 14, 2006, he was hired as the new drummer for [[The Cult]], before which he played with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]].\n\n[[Jay Noel Yuenger|J.]] produced records for [[Fu Manchu (band)|Fu Manchu]] and [[New York City|New York]]-based Puny Human.\n\nIn July 2006, original members Tom Five and de Prume reunited to perform with de Prume's band, Healer, a middle eastern infused metal band, for several concerts in Southern California for The Vans [[Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|title=Original WHITE ZOMBIE Members Team Up For VANS WARPED TOUR Appearance|publisher=[[Roadrunner Records]]|date=July 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=54694|archivedate=June 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> De Prume continues to write and record music with Healer, as well as recording, producing and engineering for special projects in his studio, Burningsound. His drums and percussion work can also be heard on Sony's \"Ghost Rider\" score. In 2009, de Prume began hosting the weekly radio show, \"Metalopolis\". His studio guests have included [[Rob Halford]], [[Dave Mustaine]], [[Max Cavalera]], [[Vinnie Paul]] and [[Tom Araya]]. De Prume is also a member of the band KREEP, and has completed a West Coast tour in spring 2010, and is planning an East Coast tour in fall 2010.\n\nIn November 2008, Geffen/UME released ''[[Let Sleeping Corpses Lie]]'', a [[boxed set]] which includes sixty four tracks featuring every White Zombie album and EP (except the remix albums), all remastered. The package also contained nine music videos (including their breakthrough Grammy-nominated hit \"Thunder Kiss '65\"), and ten live performances.

In June 2011, in an interview with ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine, he was asked why White Zombie split up, in which he replied: \"It had run its course. Success is a big thing that you can never plan for, because it affects everybody differently. I don't want to blame myself or anyone else in the band \u2014 it's just that the band didn't work anymore. Rather than continuing on and making shitty records and having it all fall apart, I thought: 'Let's just end it on a high point'\". Zombie also stated earlier in 2011 that a White Zombie reunion would never happen and he had not been in contact with any members of the band \"except [[John Tempesta]] in about 15 years.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rob-zombie-says-white-zombie-will-never-reunite/|title=ROB ZOMBIE Says WHITE ZOMBIE Will Never Reunite|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 23, 2011|accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref> In 2018, Yseult mirrored his comments, saying that with the '96 split, \"[she] was definitely ready for [the band] to be over with\", and that she stayed in touch with most other band members aside from Zombie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sean-yseult-is-not-upset-that-white-zombie-ended/|title=SEAN YSEULT Is Not Upset That WHITE ZOMBIE Ended|date=October 9, 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2013, former drummer Phil Buerstatte died.<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Marc Hogan|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/05/phil-buerstatte-white-zombie-drummer-has-died/|title=Phil Buerstatte, Former White Zombie Drummer, Dead at 44|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=May 21, 2013|accessdate=May 22, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603025147/https://www.spin.com/2013/05/phil-buerstatte-white-zombie-drummer-has-died/|archivedate=June 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortly after his death, he was impersonated by con-artist Loren Dean Breknridge, who was wanted for defrauding rehab centers across the nation, as well as scamming character actor [[Loren Dean]].<ref>{{cite web |title=\u2018White Zombie\u2019 impostor sentenced for rehab frauds in Novato, Sausalito |url=https://www.marinij.com/2013/05/24/white-zombie-impostor-sentenced-for-rehab-frauds-in-novato-sausalito/ |publisher=Marin Independent Journal}}</ref>\n\nIn a November 2015 interview with Artisan News, Yseult stated that a White Zombie vinyl box set was due for release in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/new-white-zombie-vinyl-box-set-due-in-2016/|title=New White Zombie Vinyl Box Set Due In 2016 - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref> On February 16, 2016, ''[[It Came From N.Y.C.]]'' was confirmed for a June 3 release via the Numero Group.

This region is important for the regulation of [[translation (biology)|translation]] of a [[mRNA|transcript]] by differing mechanisms in [[virus]]es, [[prokaryotes]] and [[eukaryotes]].

Initially, the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor#eIF4 .28eIF4F.29|eIF4F complex]] is recruited to the [[5\u2032 cap]], which in turn recruits the [[ribosome|ribosomal complex]] to the 5\u2032 UTR. Both [[eIF4E]] and [[eIF4G]] bind the 5\u2032 UTR, which limit the rate at which translational initiation can occur. However, this is not the only regulatory step of [[Eukaryotic translation|translation]] that involves the 5\u2032 UTR.\n\n[[RNA-binding protein]]s sometimes serve to prevent the [[Translation preinitiation complex#Cap-dependent initiation|pre-initiation complex]] from forming.  An example is regulation of the ''msl2'' gene. The protein SXL attaches to an intron segment located within the 5\u2032 UTR segment of the primary transcript, which leads to the inclusion of the intron after processing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/475731 |pmid=22693426 |pmc=3368165 |title=Before It Gets Started: Regulating Translation at the 5\u2032 UTR |year=2012 |last1=Araujo |first1=Patricia R. |last2=Yoon |first2=Kihoon |last3=Ko |first3=Daijin |last4=Smith |first4=Andrew D. |last5=Qiao |first5=Mei |last6=Suresh |first6=Uthra |last7=Burns |first7=Suzanne C. |last8=Penalva |first8=Luiz O.

However, it has also been noted that SXL can also repress translation of RNAs that do not contain a [[poly(A) tail]], or more generally, 3\u2032 UTR.\n\n[[File:Closed-loop mRNA regulation.png|thumb|left|The various forms of mRNA and how each affects translational regulation.]]\n\n==== Closed-loop regulation ====\nAnother important regulator of [[Eukaryotic translation|translation]] is the interaction between [[3\u2032 UTR]] and the 5\u2032 UTR.\n[[File:MRNAcircle.svg|thumb|200px|Interactions between [[proteins]] bound to the [[3\u2032 UTR]] and 5\u2032 UTR causing a circularization that regulates [[Eukaryotic translation|translation]].]]\nThe closed-loop structure inhibits translation.

The 5\u2032 UTR has the ability to form a hairpin loop secondary structure (known as the [[iron response element]] or IRE) that is recognized by iron-regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2).  In low levels of iron, the ORF of the target mRNA is blocked as a result of steric hindrance from the binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE.  When iron is high, then the two iron-regulatory proteins do not bind as strongly and allow proteins to be expressed that have a role in iron concentration control.  This function has gained some interest after it was revealed that the translation of [[amyloid precursor protein]] may be disrupted due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism to the IRE found in the 5\u2032 UTR of its [[mRNA]], leading to a spontaneous increased risk of [[Alzheimer's Disease]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1042/BST0361282 |title=Iron and the translation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and ferritin mRNAs: Riboregulation against neural oxidative damage in Alzheimer's disease |year=2008 |last1=Rogers |first1=Jack T. |last2=Bush |first2=Ashley I. |last3=Cho |first3=Hyan-Hee |last4=Smith |first4=Deborah H. |last5=Thomson |first5=Andrew M. |last6=Friedlich |first6=Avi L. |last7=Lahiri |first7=Debomoy K. |last8=Leedman |first8=Peter J. |last9=Huang |first9=Xudong |last10=Cahill |first10=Catherine M. |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=1282\u20137 |pmid=19021541 |pmc=2746665}}</ref>\n\n==== uORFs and reinitiation====\n{{Main|Upstream open reading frame}}\nAnother form of translational regulation in [[eukaryotes]] comes from unique elements on the 5\u2032 UTR called [[UORF|Upstream Open Reading Frames]] (uORF).

An example is regulation of the ''msl2'' gene. The protein SXL attaches to an intron segment located within the 5\u2032 UTR segment of the primary transcript, which leads to the inclusion of the intron after processing.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2012/475731 |pmid=22693426 |pmc=3368165 |title=Before It Gets Started: Regulating Translation at the 5\u2032 UTR |year=2012 |last1=Araujo |first1=Patricia R. |last2=Yoon |first2=Kihoon |last3=Ko |first3=Daijin |last4=Smith |first4=Andrew D. |last5=Qiao |first5=Mei |last6=Suresh |first6=Uthra |last7=Burns |first7=Suzanne C. |last8=Penalva |first8=Luiz O.

In low levels of iron, the ORF of the target mRNA is blocked as a result of steric hindrance from the binding of IRP1 and IRP2 to the IRE.  When iron is high, then the two iron-regulatory proteins do not bind as strongly and allow proteins to be expressed that have a role in iron concentration control.

Translation of the uORF2 requires that the ribosomes pass by the ''[[ATF4]]'' ORF, whose start codon is located within uORF2. This leads to its repression.  However, during stress conditions, the [[40S]] ribosome will bypass uORF2 because of a decrease in concentration of eIF2-TC, which means the ribosome does not acquire one in time to translate uORF2.  Instead ''[[ATF4]]'' is translated.<ref name=\"A\" />\n\n===== Other mechanisms =====\nIn addition to reinitiation, uORFs contribute to translation initiation based on:\n* The nucleotides of an uORF may code for a codon that leads to a highly structured mRNA, causing the ribosome to stall.<ref name=\"A\" />\n* cis- and trans- regulation on translation of the main protein coding sequence.<ref name=\"A\" />\n* Interactions with [[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]] sites.<ref name=\"A\" />\n\n[[File:Poliovirus genome.png|thumb|right|300px| An example [[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]] in the 5\u2032 UTR of the [[Poliovirus]] genome.]]\n\n==== Internal ribosome entry sites and viruses ====\n{{Main|Internal ribosome entry site}}\n[[Viruses|Viral]] (as well as some [[eukaryotes|eukaryotic]]) 5\u2032 UTRs contain [[internal ribosome entry site]]s, which is a cap-independent method of translational activation.

It was released in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2011 and for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in 2017; Capcom does not plan to release the game outside Japan, but a full English [[fan translation]] was released in 2015. The game is the sixth entry in the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series, and a sequel to ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth]]'' (2009).\n\nThe game follows prosecutor [[Miles Edgeworth]], detective Dick Gumshoe and the teenage thief Kay Faraday, who investigate five cases; they face off against judge Hakari Mikagami, a rival character who is part of a \"prosecutor purge\" that removes weaker prosecutors from duty. The gameplay is divided into two types of phases: investigations, where the player searches the crime scene for evidence and talks to witnesses, and rebuttals, where they aim to find contradictions in witnesses' testimonies using the evidence found during the investigations.\n\nThe development team, which included director Takeshi Yamazaki, producer Motohide Eshiro and character designer Tatsuro Iwamoto, created the game for the series' tenth anniversary, and finalized its direction during a five-day stay in the Capcom Manor in 2010. The game took shorter than usual to create, as the developers had the original ''Ace Attorney Investigations'' to use as a base, leading to an increased focus on the game's story. Reviewers were positive to the game, citing its story and the new \"logic chess\" gameplay mechanic as highlights. Several Western journalists commented on the lack of a localization and included it on lists of games they wanted to see localized.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gyakuten Kenji 2 logic chess.png|thumb|left|upright=.8|Interrogations are presented as timed games of \"logic chess\".|alt=A screenshot from the \"logic chess\" mode: on the top screen, a character is shown standing in a blue-tinted chessboard landscape, with two large, black chess pieces floating in front of her.

Asked by the Chief Prosecutor to investigate, and in the process getting involved with the infamous assassin Shelly de Killer, Edgeworth discovers that Tojiro's second-in-command Manosuke Nait\u014d had killed Tojiro to replace him as head bodyguard, and that the assassination attempt was staged by the president to reverse his declining popularity.\n\nIn the second episode, Nait\u014d is found dead in prison. S\u014dta Sarushiro, a friend of Nait\u014d, is suspected of the murder, but Edgeworth's attempt to investigate is stymied when judge Mikagami assigns prosecutor Yumihiko Ichiyanagi to the case in Edgeworth's place. To investigate, Edgeworth teams up with Tateyuki Shigaraki, a defense attorney and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Edgeworth's father Gregory. They suspect several inmates, including the assassin Ry\u014dken H\u014dinb\u014d, but it turns out that prison warden Mar\u012b Miwa killed Nait\u014d, believing that H\u014dinb\u014d had sent him to kill her. Sarushiro is freed, but Mikagami warns Edgeworth that he could lose his prosecutor's badge if he keeps investigating cases he is not assigned to.\n\nThe third episode takes up events eighteen years prior to the present, where Gregory and Shigaraki are called to defend Issei Tenkai from the charge of murdering fellow chef Isaku Hy\u014dd\u014d. Because the body has disappeared, Gregory and prosecutor Manfred von Karma cannot make much progress, but von Karma coerces Tenkai into falsely confessing to being an accomplice. This leads to Gregory accusing von Karma of forging evidence, resulting in the infamous DL-6 Incident. In the present, the chef Yutaka Kazami is almost killed in an art gallery run by Tenkai's assistant Tsukasa Oyashiki. Yumihiko is assigned to prosecute under Mikagami's direction, but Edgeworth still investigates. He concludes that Oyashiki killed Hy\u014dd\u014d and attempted to kill Kazami; Oyashiki admits to the latter crime, but accuses Kazami of being Hy\u014dd\u014d's murderer. Kazami admits to murdering Hy\u014dd\u014d, who he had conspired with to cheat in a cooking contest, but had then been betrayed by. Kazami and Oyashiki are jailed, and Tenkai is freed.\n\nIn the fourth episode, an amnesic Kay is accused of murdering defense attorney Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor [[Franziska von Karma]]. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, the head of the investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.\n\nIn the fifth episode, president Teikun \u014c is found dead, and Bansai attempts to rig Miwa's trial in her favor by manipulating Mikagami through the kidnapping of her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun \u014c has been dead for twelve years: the person previously thought to be the president was a [[Political decoy|body double]], who had hired H\u014dinb\u014d to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai to cover up the crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hy\u014dd\u014d to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hy\u014dd\u014d forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. H\u014dinb\u014d found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw H\u014dinb\u014d kill Teikun \u014c on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed H\u014dinb\u014d, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Nait\u014d and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, he was the one who attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[File:Motohide Eshiro at Anime Expo 2016, cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|The game was produced by Motohide Eshiro.|alt=A 2016 photograph of Motohide Eshiro]]\n\n''Ace Attorney Investigations 2'' was produced by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto<ref name=\"sil rival\"/> and music by [[Noriyuki Iwadare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://andriasang.com/comqzl/gyakuten_kenji_2_date/ |title=Ace Attorney Investigations Sequel Dated |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=2010-11-02 |publisher=Andriasang |access-date=2016-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225031936/http://andriasang.com/comqzl/gyakuten_kenji_2_date/ |archive-date=2012-12-25 |url-status=live}}</ref> Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for ''Ace Attorney'', was in charge of the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixivision.net/en/a/2383 |title=Exclusive drafts revealed!

It was released in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]] in 2011 and for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] in 2017; Capcom does not plan to release the game outside Japan, but a full English [[fan translation]] was released in 2015. The game is the sixth entry in the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series, and a sequel to ''[[Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth]]'' (2009).\n\nThe game follows prosecutor [[Miles Edgeworth]], detective Dick Gumshoe and the teenage thief Kay Faraday, who investigate five cases; they face off against judge Hakari Mikagami, a rival character who is part of a \"prosecutor purge\" that removes weaker prosecutors from duty. The gameplay is divided into two types of phases: investigations, where the player searches the crime scene for evidence and talks to witnesses, and rebuttals, where they aim to find contradictions in witnesses' testimonies using the evidence found during the investigations.\n\nThe development team, which included director Takeshi Yamazaki, producer Motohide Eshiro and character designer Tatsuro Iwamoto, created the game for the series' tenth anniversary, and finalized its direction during a five-day stay in the Capcom Manor in 2010. The game took shorter than usual to create, as the developers had the original ''Ace Attorney Investigations'' to use as a base, leading to an increased focus on the game's story. Reviewers were positive to the game, citing its story and the new \"logic chess\" gameplay mechanic as highlights. Several Western journalists commented on the lack of a localization and included it on lists of games they wanted to see localized.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gyakuten Kenji 2 logic chess.png|thumb|left|upright=.8|Interrogations are presented as timed games of \"logic chess\".|alt=A screenshot from the \"logic chess\" mode: on the top screen, a character is shown standing in a blue-tinted chessboard landscape, with two large, black chess pieces floating in front of her.

Asked by the Chief Prosecutor to investigate, and in the process getting involved with the infamous assassin Shelly de Killer, Edgeworth discovers that Tojiro's second-in-command Manosuke Nait\u014d had killed Tojiro to replace him as head bodyguard, and that the assassination attempt was staged by the president to reverse his declining popularity.\n\nIn the second episode, Nait\u014d is found dead in prison. S\u014dta Sarushiro, a friend of Nait\u014d, is suspected of the murder, but Edgeworth's attempt to investigate is stymied when judge Mikagami assigns prosecutor Yumihiko Ichiyanagi to the case in Edgeworth's place. To investigate, Edgeworth teams up with Tateyuki Shigaraki, a defense attorney and former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Edgeworth's father Gregory. They suspect several inmates, including the assassin Ry\u014dken H\u014dinb\u014d, but it turns out that prison warden Mar\u012b Miwa killed Nait\u014d, believing that H\u014dinb\u014d had sent him to kill her. Sarushiro is freed, but Mikagami warns Edgeworth that he could lose his prosecutor's badge if he keeps investigating cases he is not assigned to.\n\nThe third episode takes up events eighteen years prior to the present, where Gregory and Shigaraki are called to defend Issei Tenkai from the charge of murdering fellow chef Isaku Hy\u014dd\u014d. Because the body has disappeared, Gregory and prosecutor Manfred von Karma cannot make much progress, but von Karma coerces Tenkai into falsely confessing to being an accomplice. This leads to Gregory accusing von Karma of forging evidence, resulting in the infamous DL-6 Incident. In the present, the chef Yutaka Kazami is almost killed in an art gallery run by Tenkai's assistant Tsukasa Oyashiki. Yumihiko is assigned to prosecute under Mikagami's direction, but Edgeworth still investigates. He concludes that Oyashiki killed Hy\u014dd\u014d and attempted to kill Kazami; Oyashiki admits to the latter crime, but accuses Kazami of being Hy\u014dd\u014d's murderer. Kazami admits to murdering Hy\u014dd\u014d, who he had conspired with to cheat in a cooking contest, but had then been betrayed by. Kazami and Oyashiki are jailed, and Tenkai is freed.\n\nIn the fourth episode, an amnesic Kay is accused of murdering defense attorney Tsubasa Kagome. Edgeworth is brought up before the Prosecutorial Investigation Committee, which threatens to take his badge if he becomes involved with Kay's case; Edgeworth voluntarily gives up his badge and continues to investigate with help from prosecutor [[Franziska von Karma]]. He discovers that someone has been auctioning off evidence from legal cases, and finds a recording indicating that Kagome's murderer had a burn mark on their chin. When Edgeworth is called to defend himself against the committee, Mikagami reveals Bansai Ichiyanagi, the head of the investigation committee and Yumihiko's father, as the auctioneer and the one responsible for legal corruption in his former position as chief prosecutor. Edgeworth tricks him into revealing his burn mark, identifying him as Kagome's murderer. Kay then remembers being attacked by someone and Shelly de Killer reveals the concept of the mastermind to Edgeworth and Kay.\n\nIn the fifth episode, president Teikun \u014c is found dead, and Bansai attempts to rig Miwa's trial in her favor by manipulating Mikagami through the kidnapping of her adopted son, Shimon Aizawa. Edgeworth prevents this, and investigates the murder, learning that Teikun \u014c has been dead for twelve years: the person previously thought to be the president was a [[Political decoy|body double]], who had hired H\u014dinb\u014d to kill the president to take his place, and was helped by Miwa and Bansai to cover up the crime. Sarushiro is revealed to be Kazami's long lost son; as a child, he was abducted by Hy\u014dd\u014d to prevent Kazami from winning the cooking contest. Hy\u014dd\u014d forced his own son, Naito, to dispose of Sarushiro, hence why Sarushiro had Naito killed. H\u014dinb\u014d found Sarushiro and brought him to an orphanage; Sarushiro later saw H\u014dinb\u014d kill Teikun \u014c on behalf of the body double, Miwa and Bansai. They betrayed H\u014dinb\u014d, but Sarushiro helped him escape; he later enacted his revenge on them, manipulating them into killing Nait\u014d and Kagome, and killing the body double. In addition, he was the one who attacked and framed Kay to ensure that Edgeworth got involved and exposed Bansai. Sarushiro is imprisoned, and Edgeworth regains his position as a prosecutor.\n\n==Development and release==\n[[File:Motohide Eshiro at Anime Expo 2016, cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=.7|The game was produced by Motohide Eshiro.|alt=A 2016 photograph of Motohide Eshiro]]\n\n''Ace Attorney Investigations 2'' was produced by Motohide Eshiro and directed by Takeshi Yamazaki, and features character designs by Tatsuro Iwamoto<ref name=\"sil rival\"/> and music by [[Noriyuki Iwadare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://andriasang.com/comqzl/gyakuten_kenji_2_date/ |title=Ace Attorney Investigations Sequel Dated |author=Gantayat, Anoop |date=2010-11-02 |publisher=Andriasang |access-date=2016-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225031936/http://andriasang.com/comqzl/gyakuten_kenji_2_date/ |archive-date=2012-12-25 |url-status=live}}</ref> Takuro Fuse, who would later become the character designer and art director for ''Ace Attorney'', was in charge of the game's event images, and the opening and ending sequences to the episodes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixivision.net/en/a/2383 |title=Exclusive drafts revealed!
