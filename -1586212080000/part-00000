It is roughly bounded by Roosevelt Boulevard to the south, [[Frankford Creek|Tacony Creek]] to the east, Godfrey Avenue to the north, and the railroad right-of-way west of Seventh Street to the west.\n\nAlthough Olney is primarily a quiet residential neighborhood, portions do serve as major commercial centers for many surrounding groups. 5th Street has a [[Korean-American]] business district in the vicinity of Olney Avenue, and [[Hispanic]] businesses flourish in the southern reaches of the neighborhood.\n\nFisher Park is located in Olney. It is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|sing=on}} public park which was laid out and owned by [[Joseph Wharton]], founder of [[Swarthmore College]] and the Wharton School at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. It was donated to the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|city]] by Joseph in 1908 as a \"Christmas gift\" to Philadelphia. Fisher Park has a football field, basketball and tennis courts, and a wooded hiking area.\n\nOlney is named after the estate of Alexander Wilson (not the ornithologist), who resided on Rising Sun Avenue, near [[Frankford Creek|Tacony Creek]].  Wilson chose the name for his residence because of his love for the poet [[William Cowper]], of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], England. The mansion was demolished in 1924, but the name was applied to the growing village nearby.\n\n==History==\nUp until the late nineteenth century, Olney was a vast, hilly farmland in the hinterland of [[Philadelphia County]]. Until then, the population consisted mainly of farmers and wealthy Philadelphians who could afford to live away from the city.\n\nAs the city of Philadelphia grew northwards, the area became more urbanized. People seeking to escape the growing population density towards the center moved to Olney. Soon thereafter, businesses began appearing, largely centered at 5th Street and Olney Avenue. Industry was also attracted and companies such as Heintz Manufacturing Company, Proctor and Schwartz, and Brown Instrument Division built factories in the neighborhood. But this took second place to the strong commercial district, led by the Olney Businessmans' Association.\n\nThe population grew even more after the construction of the [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]] which had its original terminal at Olney Avenue ([[Olney Transportation Center]]). It promised to get riders from Olney to City Hall in less than twenty minutes for fifteen cents. In addition to trolley lines that traveled east and west, this made Olney Philadelphia's northern transportation hub and gave Olneyites easy access to the entire city and beyond.\n\nIn 1925, Colney Theatre was constructed which then had the largest one-floor [[seating capacity]] in the world with room for almost 2000 people. In 1931, Olney High School graduated its first class and for a time had the largest enrollment in the city with 3600 students. Olney High School's alumni include [[Philadelphia Phillies]] outfielder [[Del Ennis]] (1942), comedy writer Barry S.

It is roughly bounded by Roosevelt Boulevard to the south, [[Frankford Creek|Tacony Creek]] to the east, Godfrey Avenue to the north, and the railroad right-of-way west of Seventh Street to the west.\n\nAlthough Olney is primarily a quiet residential neighborhood, portions do serve as major commercial centers for many surrounding groups. 5th Street has a [[Korean-American]] business district in the vicinity of Olney Avenue, and [[Hispanic]] businesses flourish in the southern reaches of the neighborhood.\n\nFisher Park is located in Olney. It is a {{convert|23|acre|m2|sing=on}} public park which was laid out and owned by [[Joseph Wharton]], founder of [[Swarthmore College]] and the Wharton School at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. It was donated to the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|city]] by Joseph in 1908 as a \"Christmas gift\" to Philadelphia. Fisher Park has a football field, basketball and tennis courts, and a wooded hiking area.\n\nOlney is named after the estate of Alexander Wilson (not the ornithologist), who resided on Rising Sun Avenue, near [[Frankford Creek|Tacony Creek]].  Wilson chose the name for his residence because of his love for the poet [[William Cowper]], of [[Olney, Buckinghamshire|Olney]], England. The mansion was demolished in 1924, but the name was applied to the growing village nearby.\n\n==History==\nUp until the late nineteenth century, Olney was a vast, hilly farmland in the hinterland of [[Philadelphia County]]. Until then, the population consisted mainly of farmers and wealthy Philadelphians who could afford to live away from the city.\n\nAs the city of Philadelphia grew northwards, the area became more urbanized. People seeking to escape the growing population density towards the center moved to Olney. Soon thereafter, businesses began appearing, largely centered at 5th Street and Olney Avenue. Industry was also attracted and companies such as Heintz Manufacturing Company, Proctor and Schwartz, and Brown Instrument Division built factories in the neighborhood. But this took second place to the strong commercial district, led by the Olney Businessmans' Association.\n\nThe population grew even more after the construction of the [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]] which had its original terminal at Olney Avenue ([[Olney Transportation Center]]). It promised to get riders from Olney to City Hall in less than twenty minutes for fifteen cents. In addition to trolley lines that traveled east and west, this made Olney Philadelphia's northern transportation hub and gave Olneyites easy access to the entire city and beyond.\n\nIn 1925, Colney Theatre was constructed which then had the largest one-floor [[seating capacity]] in the world with room for almost 2000 people. In 1931, Olney High School graduated its first class and for a time had the largest enrollment in the city with 3600 students. Olney High School's alumni include [[Philadelphia Phillies]] outfielder [[Del Ennis]] (1942), comedy writer Barry S. Waronker (1965), local news reporter Sheila Washington (1982), and former Feltonville historian Dennis Dalbey (1994). \n\nOlneyites lobbied the city intensely for the constructions of playgrounds and the library at 5th Street and Tabor Road.

Turkey's human contributions to emissions can be segmented by industry, such as looking specifically at Turkey's [[Energy in Turkey|energy]] or commercial sectors. In addition, the natural and [[agricultural]] landscape of Turkey contribute to its national greenhouse gas emissions, with gasses being trapped in agricultural plots or forests reducing Turkey's overall emissions. Turkey's policies on energy, industry, and its explicit policies on climate change affect its level of emissions, and these policies are shaped by the relationship between emissions and economic activity. Finally, media, academic, and individual figures have provided commentary on Turkey's policies and levels of emissions. \n\nCoal, cars and cows vent half the greenhouse gas emissions by Turkey, but a fifth is absorbed by trees.

The SPUSA was founded in 1973 as a successor to the [[Socialist Party of America]], which had been renamed [[Social Democrats, USA]] a year before.\n\nThe party is officially committed to multi-tendency democratic socialism.

The SPUSA advocates for complete independence from the Democratic Party. Self-described as opposing all forms of oppression, specifically [[capitalism]] and [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] forms of [[communism]], the party advocates for the creation of a \"radical democracy that places people's lives under their own control\", a \"non-racist, classless, feminist, socialist society\" in which \"the people own and control the means of production and distribution through democratically-controlled public agencies, cooperatives, or other collective groups\"; \"full employment is realized for everyone who wants to work\"; \"workers have the right to form unions freely, and to strike and engage in other forms of job actions\"; and \"production of society is used for the benefit of all humanity, not for the private profit of a few\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.socialistpartyusa.net/principles-points-of-agreement|title=Socialism As Radical Democracy: Statement of Principles of the Socialist Party USA|publisher=Socialist Party USA|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHeadquartered at the [[A.
