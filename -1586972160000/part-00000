She made lots of really great inspirational videos. Unfortunately, since no one can watch them now, she will forever be known for deleting rather than creating them. How unfortunate that her selfishness in regard to those videos caused her to be known in such a way. Deleting the videos was not kind, avoiding telling anyone she was doing it was not brave, and she is not unstoppable since she stopped being the force of good she once was. How sad.\n\n==Personal life==\nShe had classes at [[Guildhall School of Music & Drama]] when she was a teenager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.penguin.com.au/authors/connie-glynn|title=Connie Glynn|website=Penguin Books Australia|accessdate=24 August 2019}}</ref> After graduating from the [[University of Sussex]] with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies in 2016,<ref name=\"unapologetically pink\">{{cite journal|url=https://teneightymagazine.com/2017/02/26/connie-glynn-interview-unapologetically-pink/|title=Connie Glynn: Unapologetically Pink|journal=TenEighty|first=Daniel|last=Tostevin|date=26 February 2016|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref> Glynn moved to London.\n\nGlynn is [[aromantic]] and [[bisexual]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://metro.co.uk/2018/02/12/youtuber-connie-glynn-aka-noodlerella-reveals-aromantic-7306105/?ito=cbshare|title=YouTuber Connie Glynn aka Noodlerella reveals she's aromantic|journal=Metro|first=Lucy|last=Wood|date=12 February 2018|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/love-sex/relationships/a26320354/asexual-aromantic-valentines-day/|title=\"It's a big societal reminder that I'm different\" \u2013 Valentine's Day when you're asexual or aromantic|journal=Cosmopolitan|first=Paisley|last=Gilmour|date=13 February 2019|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nShe revealed in May 2019 that she had suffered from PTSD and subsequent [[agoraphobia]] and [[paranoia]] after being hit by a car in 2016.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://teneightymagazine.com/2019/05/17/video-spotlight-i-was-insane-for-2-years-and-didnt-tell-anyone/|title=Video Spotlight: I was insane for 2 years and didn't tell anyone.|journal=TenEighty|first=Emma-Louise|last=Smith|date=17 May 2019|accessdate=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nGlynn started a blog on [[Tumblr]] where she would post about [[Disney]], [[anime]], and [[video games]].

Instead of producing images with straight lines of perspective ([[rectilinear lens|rectilinear images]]), fisheye lenses use a special mapping (for example: [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|equisolid angle]]), which gives images a characteristic convex non-rectilinear appearance. THE EARTH IS NOT FLAT.\n\nThe term ''fisheye'' was coined in 1906 by American physicist and inventor [[Robert W. Wood]] based on how a fish would see an ultrawide hemispherical view from beneath the water (a phenomenon known as [[Snell's window]]).<ref name=\"Wood-1906\">{{cite journal|author=Wood, R.

For the popular [[135 film|35 mm film]] format, typical focal lengths of fisheye lenses are between 8&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm for circular images, and 15\u201316&nbsp;mm for full-frame images.  For digital cameras using smaller electronic imagers such as {{frac|4}}\" and {{frac|3}}\" format CCD or CMOS sensors,  the focal length of \"miniature\" fisheye lenses can be as short as 1 to 2&nbsp;mm.\n\nThese types of lenses also have other applications such as re-projecting images that were originally filmed through a fisheye lens, or created via computer generated graphics, onto hemispherical screens. Fisheye lenses are also used for scientific photography such as recording of [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[meteor]]s, and to study plant canopy geometry and to calculate near-ground [[solar radiation]]. They are perhaps most commonly encountered as [[peephole]] door viewers to give the user a wide field of view.\n\n==History and development==\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=250\n |image1=Wood-1906 - Fig 1.jpg\n |caption1=Pail (top) and improved (bottom) camera\n |image2=Wood-1906 - Fig 2.jpg\n |caption2=First known fisheye image recorded in 1905 using Wood's pail apparatus\n|footer=Figures 1 and 2 from Wood's 1906 paper<ref name=Wood-1906 />\n}}\nIn 1906, Wood published a paper detailing an experiment in which he built a camera in a water-filled pail starting with a photographic plate at the bottom, a short focus lens with a pinhole diaphragm located approximately halfway up the pail, and a sheet of glass at the rim to suppress ripples in the water. The experiment was Wood's attempt \"to ascertain how the external world appears to the fish\" and hence the title of the paper was \"Fish-Eye Views, and Vision under Water\".<ref name=Wood-1906 /> Wood subsequently built an improved \"horizontal\" version of the camera omitting the lens, instead using a pinhole pierced in the side of a tank, which was filled with water and a photographic plate. In the text, he described a third \"Fish-Eye\" camera built using sheet brass, the primary advantages being that this one was more portable than the other two cameras, and was \"absolutely leaktight\".<ref name=Wood-1906 /> In his conclusion, Wood thought that \"the device will photograph the entire sky [so] a sunshine recorder could be made on this principle, which would require no adjustment for latitude or month\" but also wryly noted \"the views used for the illustration of this paper savour somewhat of the 'freak' pictures of the magazines.\"<ref name=Wood-1906 />\n\n[[File:Bond-1922 - Fig 1.png|thumb|left|Bond's hemispherical lens (1922)]]\nW.N. Bond described an improvement to Wood's apparatus in 1922 which replaced the tank of water with a simple hemispheric glass lens, making the camera significantly more portable. The focal length depended on the refractive index and radius of the hemispherical lens, and the maximum aperture was approximately {{f/}}50; it was not corrected for [[chromatic aberration]] and projected a curved field onto a flat plate. Bond noted the new lens could be used to record cloud cover or lightning strikes at a given location.<ref name=Bond-1922>{{cite journal |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077756651;view=1up;seq=1033 |title=A Wide Angle Lens for Cloud Recording |author=Bond, W.

Instead of producing images with straight lines of perspective ([[rectilinear lens|rectilinear images]]), fisheye lenses use a special mapping (for example: [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|equisolid angle]]), which gives images a characteristic convex non-rectilinear appearance.\n\nThe term ''fisheye'' was coined in 1906 by American physicist and inventor [[Robert W. Wood]] based on how a fish would see an ultrawide hemispherical view from beneath the water (a phenomenon known as [[Snell's window]]).<ref name=\"Wood-1906\">{{cite journal|author=Wood, R.

For the popular [[135 film|35 mm film]] format, typical focal lengths of fisheye lenses are between 8&nbsp;mm and 10&nbsp;mm for circular images, and 15\u201316&nbsp;mm for full-frame images.  For digital cameras using smaller electronic imagers such as {{frac|4}}\" and {{frac|3}}\" format CCD or CMOS sensors,  the focal length of \"miniature\" fisheye lenses can be as short as 1 to 2&nbsp;mm.\n\nThese types of lenses also have other applications such as re-projecting images that were originally filmed through a fisheye lens, or created via computer generated graphics, onto hemispherical screens. Fisheye lenses are also used for scientific photography such as recording of [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[meteor]]s, and to study plant canopy geometry and to calculate near-ground [[solar radiation]]. They are perhaps most commonly encountered as [[peephole]] door viewers to give the user a wide field of view.\n\n==History and development==\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=250\n |image1=Wood-1906 - Fig 1.jpg\n |caption1=Pail (top) and improved (bottom) camera\n |image2=Wood-1906 - Fig 2.jpg\n |caption2=First known fisheye image recorded in 1905 using Wood's pail apparatus\n|footer=Figures 1 and 2 from Wood's 1906 paper<ref name=Wood-1906 />\n}}\nIn 1906, Wood published a paper detailing an experiment in which he built a camera in a water-filled pail starting with a photographic plate at the bottom, a short focus lens with a pinhole diaphragm located approximately halfway up the pail, and a sheet of glass at the rim to suppress ripples in the water. The experiment was Wood's attempt \"to ascertain how the external world appears to the fish\" and hence the title of the paper was \"Fish-Eye Views, and Vision under Water\".<ref name=Wood-1906 /> Wood subsequently built an improved \"horizontal\" version of the camera omitting the lens, instead using a pinhole pierced in the side of a tank, which was filled with water and a photographic plate. In the text, he described a third \"Fish-Eye\" camera built using sheet brass, the primary advantages being that this one was more portable than the other two cameras, and was \"absolutely leaktight\".<ref name=Wood-1906 /> In his conclusion, Wood thought that \"the device will photograph the entire sky [so] a sunshine recorder could be made on this principle, which would require no adjustment for latitude or month\" but also wryly noted \"the views used for the illustration of this paper savour somewhat of the 'freak' pictures of the magazines.\"<ref name=Wood-1906 />\n\n[[File:Bond-1922 - Fig 1.png|thumb|left|Bond's hemispherical lens (1922)]]\nW.N. Bond described an improvement to Wood's apparatus in 1922 which replaced the tank of water with a simple hemispheric glass lens, making the camera significantly more portable. The focal length depended on the refractive index and radius of the hemispherical lens, and the maximum aperture was approximately {{f/}}50; it was not corrected for [[chromatic aberration]] and projected a curved field onto a flat plate. Bond noted the new lens could be used to record cloud cover or lightning strikes at a given location.<ref name=Bond-1922>{{cite journal |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015077756651;view=1up;seq=1033 |title=A Wide Angle Lens for Cloud Recording |author=Bond, W.

Only once one of the two major parties came third in an election, but that did not cause a realignment (in 1912 the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] surpassed the Republicans, but the party quickly disappeared and the Republicans re-gained their major party status).\n\nIn the 58 presidential elections since 1788, third-party or independent candidates have won at least 5.0% of the vote or garnered electoral votes 12 times (21%); this does not count [[George Washington]], who was elected as an independent in 1788\u20131789 and 1792, but who largely supported Federalist policies and was supported by Federalists. The last third-party candidate to win a state was [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968, while the last third-party candidate to win more than 5.0% of the vote was [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent and as the standard-bearer of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] in 1992 and 1996, respectively; the closest since was Gary Johnson in 2016, who gained 3.3% of the vote running as the Libertarian nominee. The most recent third-party candidates to receive an electoral vote were [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Ron Paul]] and [[Yankton Dakota|Yankton]] [[Sioux Nation]] independent [[Faith Spotted Eagle]] who received a vote each from [[faithless elector]]s in 2016.\n\n==Major third-party performances (1788\u2013present)==\n<gallery perrow=\"5\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:John Floyd (cropped).jpg|{{center|[[Governor of Virginia|Governor]]<br>[[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]]<br>of [[Virginia]]}}\nFile:Attorney General William Wirt.jpg|{{center|[[United States Attorney General|Former A.G.]]<br>[[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]<br>of [[Maryland]]}}\nFile:Van Buren.jpg|{{center|[[List of Presidents of the United States|Former president]]<br>[[Martin Van Buren]]<br>of [[New York (state)|New York]]}}\nFile:Millard Fillmore by Brady Studio 1855-65-crop.jpg|{{center|[[List of Presidents of the United States|Former president]]<br>[[Millard Fillmore]]<br>of [[New York (state)|New York]]}}\nFile:John C Breckinridge-04775-restored.jpg|{{center|[[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice President]]<br>[[John C.

The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], who had been one-half of the two-party system since 1832 and had won the presidency in 1840 and 1848, disintegrated. Southern Whigs and a minority of northern Whigs coalesced around the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic American Party, better known as the \"[[Know Nothing]]\" movement. Their candidate was former President [[Millard Fillmore]], who won 22% but carried only one state, Maryland, thus winning 8 electoral votes.  Many Northern Whigs, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], joined the newly formed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  The Republicans ran [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], who finished second with 33.1% and 114 electoral votes.  Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the election.\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1860 United States presidential election}}\n[[John C. Breckinridge]], the third-party candidate of southern Democrats, got 18.2% of the popular vote and won 72 electoral votes from several south states. [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] finished with 12.6% of the popular vote, but only won 39 electoral votes from three states.  Though both Bell and Breckinridge were unable to capture as many popular votes as the two main presidential candidates (Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]]), this election would mark the first time any third party received more electoral votes than one of the major candidates in a US presidential election.  Douglas finished with 29.5% of the popular vote, but only won 12 electoral votes from two states.\n\nIn 1864 Abraham Lincoln ran his re-election campaign as a third party, known as [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] party, consisting of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n===1872 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1872 United States presidential election}}\nIn the 1872 election, newspaper publisher and former Congressman [[Horace Greeley]] was nominated by the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]]s to oppose incumbent Republican President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. The Liberal Republicans were a breakaway faction of the Republican Party that was dissatisfied with Grant's presidency. Determined to defeat Grant, the Democratic Party [[1872 Democratic National Convention|also nominated]] Greeley, making Greeley both a third-party nominee and a major party nominee. Greeley won six states and 43.8% of the popular vote, but died shortly after election day, so most of the electoral votes that were pledged to Greeley instead went to Democrat [[Thomas Hendricks]] or Greeley's running mate, Liberal Republican [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]].\n\n===1892 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1892 United States presidential election}}\n[[James B. Weaver]], the Greenback Labor nominee in 1880, ran as presidential candidate for the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]]. The Populist Party won 22 electoral votes and 8.51 percent of the popular vote [https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1892&off=0&f=1]. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] eventually adopted many Populist Party positions after this election, notably the Populist call for the [[Free Silver|free coinage of silver]], making this contest a prominent example of a delayed vote for change.\n\n===1912 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1912 United States presidential election}}\nRepublican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ran as the \"Bull Moose Party\" ([[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]) nominee in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]].  Roosevelt won 27.4% of the popular vote and carried six states totaling 88 electoral votes.  Overall, Roosevelt's effort was the most successful third-party candidacy in American history. It was also the only third-party effort to finish higher than third in the popular votes and only the second to do so in electoral votes. Instead incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] finished third, taking only 23% of the popular vote and 8 electoral votes.  The split in the Republican vote gave Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] victory with 42% of the popular vote, but 435 electoral votes.\n\n[[Eugene V. Debs]], running in his fourth consecutive Presidential election as the Socialist Party candidate, won 6% of the vote, an all-time high for the Socialists. The elections of [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] and [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] are the only three times that four candidates each cleared 5% of the popular vote in a Presidential election.\n\n===1924 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1924 United States presidential election}}\nErstwhile Republican [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]] ran as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|Progressive]]. After the Democrats nominated conservative [[John W. Davis]], many liberal Democrats turned to La Follette. He received 4,831,706 votes for 16.6% of the popular vote and won his home state of [[Wisconsin]] receiving 13 electoral votes.  With the Democrats split, incumbent President [[Calvin Coolidge]] won election by a wide margin.\n\n===1948 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1948 United States presidential election}}\nDemocrat [[Strom Thurmond]] ran on the [[racial segregation|segregationist]] States' Rights (\"[[Dixiecrat]]\") ticket. Former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] ran on the liberal left as the candidate of a new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]].  Thus the Democratic vote was split three ways, between Thurmond on the right, Wallace on the left, and incumbent President [[Harry S. Truman]] in the center. Thurmond received 1,175,930 votes (2.4%) and 39 votes in the electoral college from [[U.S. Southern states|Southern states]]. Wallace earned 1,157,328 votes for an identical 2.4% of the popular vote, but no votes in the Electoral College due to his support being mostly concentrated in the more populous states of New York and California.\n\n===The Unpledged Electors Movement 1944\u20131964===\n{{see|Unpledged elector|1960 United States presidential election#Unpledged Democratic electors}}\nWith the Democratic party becoming more amenable to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the numerous southern Democrats split from the party and started putting up slates of unpledged electors to compete with the national Democratic ticket. During the 1952, 1956, and 1960 elections these received a substantial percentage of votes, most notably coming in second in South Carolina in 1956 ahead of President Eisenhower, and actually winning Mississippi and splitting the electoral vote in Alabama in 1960, giving segregationist Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] of [[Virginia]] 14 electoral votes. In 1964 Alabama members of the movement refused to put [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] on the ballot, leaving the electors unpledged.\n\n===1968 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1968 United States presidential election}}\nFormer Democratic Governor of [[Alabama]] [[George Wallace]] ran on the [[American Independent Party]] line. Wallace received 9,901,118 votes for 13.5% of the popular vote, receiving 45 electoral votes in [[Southern United States|the South]] and many votes in the North. Wallace remains the only third-party candidate since 1948 to win a state.\n\n===1972 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1972 United States presidential election}}\nDespite only garnering 3,674 votes (roughly 0.005% of the actual electorate), [[John G. Hospers]] of the Libertarian Party secured one electoral vote in this election due to [[Virginia]] [[faithless elector]], [[Roger MacBride]].<ref name=\"lp\"/> In addition, the results of the faithless elector made the Libertarian vice-presidential nominee [[Tonie Nathan|Theodora \"Tonie\" Nathan]] the first woman in U.S. history to receive an electoral vote.<ref name=\"lp\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q6tVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3741,7501174&dq=john-hospers+electoral+vote+1972&hl=en | title=Libertarians trying to escape obscurity | agency=Associated Press | work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] | date=December 30, 1973 | accessdate=July 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1980 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1980 United States presidential election}}\nCongressman [[John B.

[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate [[Ed Clark]] won 921,128 votes, or 1.1% of the total. No other Libertarian candidate has ever gotten more than 0.5% in a presidential election until Gary Johnson won 1% in 2012.\n\n===1992 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1992 United States presidential election}}\n[[Ross Perot]], an independent, won 18.9% of the popular vote (but no electoral votes). His was the best popular vote showing ever for an independent candidate who stood alone on no third-party ticket. Not until four years later would Perot seek to run for the first time on a third-party ticket. As an independent, however, Perot finished second in two states: in Utah ahead of election winner [[Bill Clinton]], and in Maine ahead of incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]].\n\n===1996 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1996 United States presidential election}}\n[[Ross Perot]] ran for president again, this time as the candidate of the newly founded [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]]. He won 8% of the popular vote.\n===2000 presidential election===\n{{Main articles|2000 United States presidential election|Bush v. Gore}}\n[[Ralph Nader]] received almost 3% of the vote nationwide, and his individual state totals were in some cases much higher, exceeding the margin between the two main candidates, including [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and Florida, the latter of which some could argue flipped the election from Gore to Bush.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/05/31/nader_elected_bush_why_we_shouldnt_forget_130715.html|title=Nader Elected Bush: Why We Shouldn't Forget {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===2016 presidential election===\n{{Main article|2016 United States presidential election}}\nThe national total for third-party candidates and write-ins was well over 5%. [[2016 United States presidential election in Utah|In Utah]], [[Evan McMullin]] received over 20% of the vote, while [[2016 United States presidential election in Vermont|in Vermont]] [[Bernie Sanders]] received over 5% of the vote despite not appearing on the ballot. Green candidate [[Jill Stein]] and Libertarian [[Gary Johnson]] received over a million votes each nationwide.\n\nIn a mini-revolt against the top two candidates, a record number of ten faithless electors cast their votes for other candidates, three of which were disallowed. Most of these went to other Republicans and Democrats, but one vote went to [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Ron Paul]] and [[Yankton Dakota|Yankton]] [[Sioux Nation]] independent [[Faith Spotted Eagle]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{United States political parties}}\n{{US Third Party Election}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of elections in the United States]]\n[[Category:Presidential elections in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{refimprove|date=May 2019}}\n{{cleanup|reason=original research [[WP:OR]]|date=May 2019}}\n{{See also|List of third party performances in United States elections}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2016}}\n\nThis is a '''list of third-party performances in [[United States presidential election]]s'''.\n\nIn the [[United States]] it is rare for [[Third party (United States)|third-party]] and independent candidates, other than those of the six parties which have succeeded as major parties ([[Federalist Party]], [[Democratic-Republican Party]], [[National Republican Party]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]), to take large shares of the vote in elections, unless in a [[realigning election]].\n\nOccasionally, a third party becomes one of the two major parties through a presidential election (the last time it happened was in 1856, when the Republicans supplanted the Whigs, who had withered and endorsed the ticket of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]]): such an election is called a [[realigning election]], as it causes a realignment in the party system; according to scholars, there have been [[Political parties in the United States#History and early political parties|six party systems]] so far. Only once one of the two major parties came third in an election, but that did not cause a realignment (in 1912 the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]] surpassed the Republicans, but the party quickly disappeared and the Republicans re-gained their major party status).\n\nIn the 58 presidential elections since 1788, third-party or independent candidates have won at least 5.0% of the vote or garnered electoral votes 12 times (21%); this does not count [[George Washington]], who was elected as an independent in 1788\u20131789 and 1792, but who largely supported Federalist policies and was supported by Federalists. The last third-party candidate to win a state was [[George Wallace]] of the [[American Independent Party]] in 1968, while the last third-party candidate to win more than 5.0% of the vote was [[Ross Perot]], who ran as an independent and as the standard-bearer of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] in 1992 and 1996, respectively; the closest since was Gary Johnson in 2016, who gained 3.3% of the vote running as the Libertarian nominee. The most recent third-party candidates to receive an electoral vote were [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Ron Paul]] and [[Yankton Dakota|Yankton]] [[Sioux Nation]] independent [[Faith Spotted Eagle]] who received a vote each from [[faithless elector]]s in 2016.\n\n==Major third-party performances (1788\u2013present)==\n<gallery perrow=\"5\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:John Floyd (cropped).jpg|{{center|[[Governor of Virginia|Governor]]<br>[[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]]<br>of [[Virginia]]}}\nFile:Attorney General William Wirt.jpg|{{center|[[United States Attorney General|Former A.G.]]<br>[[William Wirt (Attorney General)|William Wirt]]<br>of [[Maryland]]}}\nFile:Van Buren.jpg|{{center|[[List of Presidents of the United States|Former president]]<br>[[Martin Van Buren]]<br>of [[New York (state)|New York]]}}\nFile:Millard Fillmore by Brady Studio 1855-65-crop.jpg|{{center|[[List of Presidents of the United States|Former president]]<br>[[Millard Fillmore]]<br>of [[New York (state)|New York]]}}\nFile:John C Breckinridge-04775-restored.jpg|{{center|[[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|Vice President]]<br>[[John C.

The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], who had been one-half of the two-party system since 1832 and had won the presidency in 1840 and 1848, disintegrated. Southern Whigs and a minority of northern Whigs coalesced around the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic American Party, better known as the \"[[Know Nothing]]\" movement. Their candidate was former President [[Millard Fillmore]], who won 22% but carried only one state, Maryland, thus winning 8 electoral votes.  Many Northern Whigs, such as [[Abraham Lincoln]], joined the newly formed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  The Republicans ran [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], who finished second with 33.1% and 114 electoral votes.  Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the election.\n\n===1860 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1860 United States presidential election}}\n[[John C. Breckinridge]], the third-party candidate of southern Democrats, got 18.2% of the popular vote and won 72 electoral votes from several south states. [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] of the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] finished with 12.6% of the popular vote, but only won 39 electoral votes from three states.  Though both Bell and Breckinridge were unable to capture as many popular votes as the two main presidential candidates (Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Democrat [[Stephen A. Douglas]]), this election would mark the first time any third party received more electoral votes than one of the major candidates in a US presidential election.  Douglas finished with 29.5% of the popular vote, but only won 12 electoral votes from two states.\n\nIn 1864 Abraham Lincoln ran his re-election campaign as a third party, known as [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] party, consisting of both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n===1872 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1872 United States presidential election}}\nIn the 1872 election, newspaper publisher and former Congressman [[Horace Greeley]] was nominated by the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]]s to oppose incumbent Republican President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]. The Liberal Republicans were a breakaway faction of the Republican Party that was dissatisfied with Grant's presidency. Determined to defeat Grant, the Democratic Party [[1872 Democratic National Convention|also nominated]] Greeley, making Greeley both a third-party nominee and a major party nominee. Greeley won six states and 43.8% of the popular vote, but died shortly after election day, so most of the electoral votes that were pledged to Greeley instead went to Democrat [[Thomas Hendricks]] or Greeley's running mate, Liberal Republican [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]].\n\n===1892 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1892 United States presidential election}}\n[[James B. Weaver]], the Greenback Labor nominee in 1880, ran as presidential candidate for the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]]. The Populist Party won 22 electoral votes and 8.51 percent of the popular vote [https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1892&off=0&f=1]. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] eventually adopted many Populist Party positions after this election, notably the Populist call for the [[Free Silver|free coinage of silver]], making this contest a prominent example of a delayed vote for change.\n\n===1912 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1912 United States presidential election}}\nRepublican [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ran as the \"Bull Moose Party\" ([[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]) nominee in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 election]].  Roosevelt won 27.4% of the popular vote and carried six states totaling 88 electoral votes.  Overall, Roosevelt's effort was the most successful third-party candidacy in American history. It was also the only third-party effort to finish higher than third in the popular votes and only the second to do so in electoral votes. Instead incumbent Republican President [[William Howard Taft]] finished third, taking only 23% of the popular vote and 8 electoral votes.  The split in the Republican vote gave Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] victory with 42% of the popular vote, but 435 electoral votes.\n\n[[Eugene V. Debs]], running in his fourth consecutive Presidential election as the Socialist Party candidate, won 6% of the vote, an all-time high for the Socialists. The elections of [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] and [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] are the only three times that four candidates each cleared 5% of the popular vote in a Presidential election.\n\n===1924 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1924 United States presidential election}}\nErstwhile Republican [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]] ran as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|Progressive]]. After the Democrats nominated conservative [[John W. Davis]], many liberal Democrats turned to La Follette. He received 4,831,706 votes for 16.6% of the popular vote and won his home state of [[Wisconsin]] receiving 13 electoral votes.  With the Democrats split, incumbent President [[Calvin Coolidge]] won election by a wide margin.\n\n===1948 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1948 United States presidential election}}\nDemocrat [[Strom Thurmond]] ran on the [[racial segregation|segregationist]] States' Rights (\"[[Dixiecrat]]\") ticket. Former Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]] ran on the liberal left as the candidate of a new [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]].  Thus the Democratic vote was split three ways, between Thurmond on the right, Wallace on the left, and incumbent President [[Harry S. Truman]] in the center. Thurmond received 1,175,930 votes (2.4%) and 39 votes in the electoral college from [[U.S. Southern states|Southern states]]. Wallace earned 1,157,328 votes for an identical 2.4% of the popular vote, but no votes in the Electoral College due to his support being mostly concentrated in the more populous states of New York and California.\n\n===The Unpledged Electors Movement 1944\u20131964===\n{{see|Unpledged elector|1960 United States presidential election#Unpledged Democratic electors}}\nWith the Democratic party becoming more amenable to the [[Civil Rights Movement]], the numerous southern Democrats split from the party and started putting up slates of unpledged electors to compete with the national Democratic ticket. During the 1952, 1956, and 1960 elections these received a substantial percentage of votes, most notably coming in second in South Carolina in 1956 ahead of President Eisenhower, and actually winning Mississippi and splitting the electoral vote in Alabama in 1960, giving segregationist Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] of [[Virginia]] 14 electoral votes. In 1964 Alabama members of the movement refused to put [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]] on the ballot, leaving the electors unpledged.\n\n===1968 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1968 United States presidential election}}\nFormer Democratic Governor of [[Alabama]] [[George Wallace]] ran on the [[American Independent Party]] line. Wallace received 9,901,118 votes for 13.5% of the popular vote, receiving 45 electoral votes in [[Southern United States|the South]] and many votes in the North. Wallace remains the only third-party candidate since 1948 to win a state.\n\n===1972 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1972 United States presidential election}}\nDespite only garnering 3,674 votes (roughly 0.005% of the actual electorate), [[John G. Hospers]] of the Libertarian Party secured one electoral vote in this election due to [[Virginia]] [[faithless elector]], [[Roger MacBride]].<ref name=\"lp\"/> In addition, the results of the faithless elector made the Libertarian vice-presidential nominee [[Tonie Nathan|Theodora \"Tonie\" Nathan]] the first woman in U.S. history to receive an electoral vote.<ref name=\"lp\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q6tVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3741,7501174&dq=john-hospers+electoral+vote+1972&hl=en | title=Libertarians trying to escape obscurity | agency=Associated Press | work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] | date=December 30, 1973 | accessdate=July 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1980 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1980 United States presidential election}}\nCongressman [[John B.

[[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate [[Ed Clark]] won 921,128 votes, or 1.1% of the total. No other Libertarian candidate has ever gotten more than 0.5% in a presidential election until Gary Johnson won 1% in 2012.\n\n===1992 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1992 United States presidential election}}\n[[Ross Perot]], an independent, won 18.9% of the popular vote (but no electoral votes). His was the best popular vote showing ever for an independent candidate who stood alone on no third-party ticket. Not until four years later would Perot seek to run for the first time on a third-party ticket. As an independent, however, Perot finished second in two states: in Utah ahead of election winner [[Bill Clinton]], and in Maine ahead of incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush]].\n\n===1996 presidential election===\n{{Main article|1996 United States presidential election}}\n[[Ross Perot]] ran for president again, this time as the candidate of the newly founded [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]]. He won 8% of the popular vote.\n===2000 presidential election===\n{{Main articles|2000 United States presidential election|Bush v. Gore}}\n[[Ralph Nader]] received almost 3% of the vote nationwide, and his individual state totals were in some cases much higher, exceeding the margin between the two main candidates, including [[2000 United States presidential election in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and Florida, the latter of which some could argue flipped the election from Gore to Bush.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/05/31/nader_elected_bush_why_we_shouldnt_forget_130715.html|title=Nader Elected Bush: Why We Shouldn't Forget {{!}} RealClearPolitics|website=www.realclearpolitics.com|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===2016 presidential election===\n{{Main article|2016 United States presidential election}}\nThe national total for third-party candidates and write-ins was well over 5%. [[2016 United States presidential election in Utah|In Utah]], [[Evan McMullin]] received over 20% of the vote, while [[2016 United States presidential election in Vermont|in Vermont]] [[Bernie Sanders]] received over 5% of the vote despite not appearing on the ballot. Green candidate [[Jill Stein]] and Libertarian [[Gary Johnson]] received over a million votes each nationwide.\n\nIn a mini-revolt against the top two candidates, a record number of ten faithless electors cast their votes for other candidates, three of which were disallowed. Most of these went to other Republicans and Democrats, but one vote went to [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[Ron Paul]] and [[Yankton Dakota|Yankton]] [[Sioux Nation]] independent [[Faith Spotted Eagle]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{United States political parties}}\n{{US Third Party Election}}\n{{United States topics}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of elections in the United States]]\n[[Category:Presidential elections in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "cap", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_third-party_performances_in_United_States_presidential_elections"}

It connects the [[Southeastern Connecticut|Eastern Coastline]] of the state along with the [[Lower Connecticut River Valley]] to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and the [[Greater Hartford|Capital Region]].\n\n==Route description==\nRoute&nbsp;9 is a 4 lane freeway for most of its entire length.  It begins at [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]]/[[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S.&nbsp;1]] Exit 69, on the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]]. It runs northwesterly, parallel to the river for approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} between [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] and [[Connecticut Route 99|Route 99]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]].  Along the river, it passes through the towns of [[Essex, Connecticut|Essex]], [[Deep River, Connecticut|Deep River]], [[Chester, Connecticut|Chester]], [[Haddam, Connecticut|Haddam]], and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]).  After its junction with [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate&nbsp;91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]], Route&nbsp;9 continues westward then northward, running through the [[Greater Hartford|Hartford area]] towns/cities of [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]]. At the junction with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]]/[[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] near the [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] - [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] town line, Route&nbsp;9 follows the ramps for eastbound [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] and ends at the merge with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] immediately after crossing the town line.\n\nRoute&nbsp;9 has a non-freeway portion in the downtown area of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], where it overlaps with [[Connecticut Route 17|Route&nbsp;17]]. The non-freeway portion is {{convert|0.35|mi|km}} in length and consists of two at-grade intersections with traffic lights (signed as Exits 15 and 16), and one median break to allow access to and from Miller Street. One of these intersections is where Route&nbsp;17 leaves Route&nbsp;9 to join [[Connecticut Route 66|Route&nbsp;66]]. [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|ConnDOT]] may soon consider upgrading the at-grade interchanges of the expressway and make on/off ramps.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct9.html|title=Connecticut Route 9|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/lib/dot/documents/dhighwaydesign/rte9middletown_plan.pdf|title=CT DOT Construction Route 9|accessdate=2017-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe section from [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] in Old Saybrook to [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91 in]] [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] is known as the ''[[Chester Bowles]] Highway''. The section from [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] to Exit 24 in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]] is known as the ''[[Korean War]] Veterans Memorial Highway''. The section from [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] in New Britain to [[Connecticut Route 175|Route&nbsp;175]] in Newington is known as the ''[[Taras Shevchenko]] Expressway''. The section from [[Connecticut Route 175|Route&nbsp;175]] in [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]] to the junction with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] is known as the ''[[Iwo Jima]] Memorial Expressway''.\n\n==History==\nThe road connecting [[Deep River, Connecticut|Deep River]] (then known as Saybrook) and [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] along the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]] was a toll road known as the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Connecticut)|Middlesex Turnpike]], which operated from 1802 to 1876. Another toll road running from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to the northwest corner of [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was known as the [[Granby Turnpike]] and operated from 1800 to 1854.\n\nThe state took over maintenance of trunk highways at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1922, New England began publicly numbering its state roads. The road running from [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to the Massachusetts state line in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was designated as part of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], a multi-state route continuing all the way to northern New Hampshire. The portion of New England Route 10 in Connecticut used the alignments of the Middlesex and Granby Turnpikes. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], [[Connecticut Route 10|Route&nbsp;10]] was relocated to a different alignment beginning in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] instead. The Old Saybrook to Granby road was designated as Route&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"1932renumAug6\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s and early 1960s, various plans for a freeway along the Route&nbsp;9 alignment were developed. Construction also began on the [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] segment around this time. The freeway from [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] to [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] was completely open by 1969. Old Route&nbsp;9 south of Middletown was re-designated as Route&nbsp;9A (later to be designated as [[Connecticut Route 154|Route&nbsp;154]]).\n\nSeveral options were considered and then later abandoned for the freeway portion through [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and points north. By the mid-1960s, a Route&nbsp;9 freeway alignment through Hartford was finally abandoned. Route&nbsp;9 was truncated to end at [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] instead. The portion of old Route&nbsp;9 from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was assigned as an extension of [[Connecticut Route 189|Route&nbsp;189]], while the [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] segment that was not upgraded to freeway was re-designated as [[Connecticut Route 99|Route&nbsp;99]].\n\nIn 1979, the eastern end of the [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] freeway up to the [[Berlin Turnpike]] was completed, including a connector to the planned alignment of [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate&nbsp;291]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]]. By this time, however, this portion of [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate&nbsp;291]] had been deleted from the state's Interstate network. By 1989, a freeway connection was completed between the north end of Route&nbsp;9 at [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] and the east end of [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] at the [[Berlin Turnpike]].

It connects the [[Southeastern Connecticut|Eastern Coastline]] of the state along with the [[Lower Connecticut River Valley]] to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and the [[Greater Hartford|Capital Region]].\n\n==Route description==\nRoute&nbsp;9 is a 4 lane freeway for most of its entire length.  It begins at [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]]/[[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut|U.S.&nbsp;1]] Exit 69, on the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]]. It runs northwesterly, parallel to the river for approximately {{convert|25|mi|km}} between [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] and [[Connecticut Route 99|Route 99]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]].  Along the river, it passes through the towns of [[Essex, Connecticut|Essex]], [[Deep River, Connecticut|Deep River]], [[Chester, Connecticut|Chester]], [[Haddam, Connecticut|Haddam]], and [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]]).  After its junction with [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|Interstate&nbsp;91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]], Route&nbsp;9 continues westward then northward, running through the [[Greater Hartford|Hartford area]] towns/cities of [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]]. At the junction with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]]/[[U.S. Route 6 in Connecticut|US 6]] near the [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] - [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] town line, Route&nbsp;9 follows the ramps for eastbound [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] and ends at the merge with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] immediately after crossing the town line.\n\nRoute&nbsp;9 has a non-freeway portion in the downtown area of [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]], where it overlaps with [[Connecticut Route 17|Route&nbsp;17]]. The non-freeway portion is {{convert|0.35|mi|km}} in length and consists of two at-grade intersections with traffic lights (signed as Exits 15 and 16), and one median break to allow access to and from Miller Street. One of these intersections is where Route&nbsp;17 leaves Route&nbsp;9 to join [[Connecticut Route 66|Route&nbsp;66]]. [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|ConnDOT]] may soon consider upgrading the at-grade interchanges of the expressway and make on/off ramps.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.kurumi.com/roads/ct/ct9.html|title=Connecticut Route 9|accessdate=2010-01-02}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ct.gov/dot/lib/dot/documents/dhighwaydesign/rte9middletown_plan.pdf|title=CT DOT Construction Route 9|accessdate=2017-05-15}}</ref>\n\nThe section from [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] in Old Saybrook to [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91 in]] [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] is known as the ''[[Chester Bowles]] Highway''. The section from [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] to Exit 24 in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]] is known as the ''[[Korean War]] Veterans Memorial Highway''. The section from [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] in New Britain to [[Connecticut Route 175|Route&nbsp;175]] in Newington is known as the ''[[Taras Shevchenko]] Expressway''. The section from [[Connecticut Route 175|Route&nbsp;175]] in [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]] to the junction with [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] is known as the ''[[Iwo Jima]] Memorial Expressway''.\n\n==History==\nThe road connecting [[Deep River, Connecticut|Deep River]] (then known as Saybrook) and [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]] along the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]] was a toll road known as the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Connecticut)|Middlesex Turnpike]], which operated from 1802 to 1876. Another toll road running from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to the northwest corner of [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was known as the [[Granby Turnpike]] and operated from 1800 to 1854.\n\nThe state took over maintenance of trunk highways at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1922, New England began publicly numbering its state roads. The road running from [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to the Massachusetts state line in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was designated as part of [[Connecticut Route 10|Route 10]], a multi-state route continuing all the way to northern New Hampshire. The portion of New England Route 10 in Connecticut used the alignments of the Middlesex and Granby Turnpikes. In the [[1932 state highway renumbering (Connecticut)|1932 state highway renumbering]], [[Connecticut Route 10|Route&nbsp;10]] was relocated to a different alignment beginning in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] instead. The Old Saybrook to Granby road was designated as Route&nbsp;9.<ref name=\"1932renumAug6\" />\n\nIn the mid-1950s and early 1960s, various plans for a freeway along the Route&nbsp;9 alignment were developed. Construction also began on the [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]] to [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] segment around this time. The freeway from [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] to [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] was completely open by 1969. Old Route&nbsp;9 south of Middletown was re-designated as Route&nbsp;9A (later to be designated as [[Connecticut Route 154|Route&nbsp;154]]).\n\nSeveral options were considered and then later abandoned for the freeway portion through [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and points north. By the mid-1960s, a Route&nbsp;9 freeway alignment through Hartford was finally abandoned. Route&nbsp;9 was truncated to end at [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] in [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] instead. The portion of old Route&nbsp;9 from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] was assigned as an extension of [[Connecticut Route 189|Route&nbsp;189]], while the [[Cromwell, Connecticut|Cromwell]] to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] segment that was not upgraded to freeway was re-designated as [[Connecticut Route 99|Route&nbsp;99]].\n\nIn 1979, the eastern end of the [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] freeway up to the [[Berlin Turnpike]] was completed, including a connector to the planned alignment of [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate&nbsp;291]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]]. By this time, however, this portion of [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|Interstate&nbsp;291]] had been deleted from the state's Interstate network. By 1989, a freeway connection was completed between the north end of Route&nbsp;9 at [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] and the east end of [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] at the [[Berlin Turnpike]]. [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] was truncated to end at the I-291 connector while Route&nbsp;9 was extended along the deleted portion of the [[Connecticut Route 72|Route&nbsp;72]] freeway. Route&nbsp;9 also took over the [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|I-291]] connector, which was extended in 1986 to [[Connecticut Route 175|Route&nbsp;175]].\n\nIn 1992 Route&nbsp;9 was finally connected to [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]] using a portion of the cancelled [[Interstate 291 (Connecticut)|I-291]] right of way, completing Route&nbsp;9 as it exists today.

The town is sited on the watersheds of the [[Ipswich River|Ipswich]], [[Mystic River|Mystic]], and [[Shawsheen River|Shawsheen]] rivers. In colonial times up through the late 19th century, there was industry in the mills along [[Vine Brook]], which runs from [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] to [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]] and then empties into the Shawsheen River.\n\n[[File:Burlington Business District.JPG|thumbnail|left|Business District]]Burlington is now a suburban industrial town at the junction of the [[Boston]]-[[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] corridor, but for most of its history it was almost entirely agricultural, selling hops and rye to Boston and supplementing that income with small shoe-making shops. Early railroad expansion passed the town by (although the town was serviced by the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]]), limiting its early development, and Burlington continued to cure hams for the [[Boston]] market and produce milk, fruit, and vegetables.\n\nThis picture changed drastically, however, as soon as [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] was built. The highway kicked off an enormous expansion, and between 1955 and 1965 Burlington was the fastest growing town in the state. In one five-year period, its population tripled as residential and commercial retail development exploded creating the town's present character. It is currently a residential and professional hub.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in the [[Greater Boston Area]] of eastern Massachusetts, Burlington is bordered by [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]] on the west, [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]] on the north, [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] on the northeast, [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] on the southeast, and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the south. Burlington is {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], {{convert|12|mi|km}} northwest of [[Boston]], {{convert|36|mi|km}} southeast of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], and {{convert|224|mi|km}} from New York City. Its highest point is Greenleaf Mountain ({{convert|290|ft|m}} above sea level), and lowest point is the Great Meadow {{convert|150|ft|m}} above sea level. The elevation at Town Hall is {{convert|220|ft|m}} above sea level. The largest body of water is the {{convert|500|e6USgal|m3|adj=on}} [[Mill Pond Reservoir]] in the eastern part of the town.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|11.9|sqmi|sqkm}}, of which {{convert|11.8|sqmi|sqkm}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|sqkm}}, or 0.59%, is water.

In colonial times up through the late 19th century, there was industry in the mills along [[Vine Brook]], which runs from [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] to [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]] and then empties into the Shawsheen River.\n\n[[File:Burlington Business District.JPG|thumbnail|left|Business District]]Burlington is now a suburban industrial town at the junction of the [[Boston]]-[[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] corridor, but for most of its history it was almost entirely agricultural, selling hops and rye to Boston and supplementing that income with small shoe-making shops. Early railroad expansion passed the town by (although the town was serviced by the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]]), limiting its early development, and Burlington continued to cure hams for the [[Boston]] market and produce milk, fruit, and vegetables.\n\nThis picture changed drastically, however, as soon as [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]] was built. The highway kicked off an enormous expansion, and between 1955 and 1965 Burlington was the fastest growing town in the state. In one five-year period, its population tripled as residential and commercial retail development exploded creating the town's present character. It is currently a residential and professional hub.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in the [[Greater Boston Area]] of eastern Massachusetts, Burlington is bordered by [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]] on the west, [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]] on the north, [[Wilmington, Massachusetts|Wilmington]] on the northeast, [[Woburn, Massachusetts|Woburn]] on the southeast, and [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]] on the south.
