By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"[[Isis]]\".<ref name=\"BIRLEY42\">Birley (1999:42).</ref> In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god [[Odin]] as \"[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\", Thor as \"Hercules\", and the god {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[Isis]] of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god. In relation, {{lang|ang|Thunor}} is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss ''Jupiter'', the god may be referenced in the poem ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]'', where the thunder strikes the devil with a \"fiery axe\", and the Old English expression {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} (\"thunder ride\") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led chariot.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\">Turville-Petre (1964:99)</ref><ref name=\"THUNOR\">See North (1998:238\u2014241) for {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} and tales regarding {{lang|ang|Thunor}}, see ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (1910:608) regarding usage of {{lang|ang|Thunor}} as an Old English gloss for ''Jupiter'' and {{lang|ang|[[T\u00fdr|Tiw]]}} employed as a gloss for ''Mars''.</ref>\n\nA 9th-century AD codex from [[Mainz]], Germany, known as the ''[[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]'', records the name of three Old Saxon gods, {{lang|osx|UU\u00f4den}} (Old Saxon \"[[Wodan]]\"), {{lang|osx|[[Seaxn\u0113at|Saxn\u00f4te]]}}, and {{lang|osx|Thunaer}}, by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally [[christianization of the Germanic peoples|converting to Christianity]].<ref name=\"SIMEK276\">Simek (2007:276).</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentish royal legend]], probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of [[Ecgberht of Kent]] called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as {{lang|ang|\u00feunores hl\u00e6we}} (Old English 'Thunor's mound').

Early depictions portray Olaf as clean-shaven, but after 1200 he appears with a red beard.{{sfn|Lindahl|McNamara|Lindow|2002|p=299}} For centuries, Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of [[troll]]s and giants, and as a protector against malicious forces.{{sfn|Ast\u00e5s|1993|p=446}}\n\n===Modern folklore===\nTales about Thor, or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor, continued into the modern period, particularly in Scandinavia. Writing in the 19th century, scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god, such as the Norwegian {{lang|no|Thorsvarme}} (\"Thor's warmth\") for lightning and the Swedish {{lang|sv|godgubben \u00e5far}} (\"The good old (fellow) is taking a ride\") as well as the word {{wikt-lang|sv|tord\u00f6n}} (\"Thor's rumble\" or \"Thor's thunder\") when it thunders. Grimm comments that, at times, Scandinavians often \"no longer liked to utter the god's real name, or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness\".<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\">Grimm (1882:166\u201477).</ref>\n\nThor remained pictured as a red-bearded figure, as evident by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as {{lang|da|Thor med sit lange sk\u00e6g}} (\"Thor with the long beard\") and the [[North-Frisia]]n curse {{lang|frr|diis ruadhiiret donner regiir!}} (\"let red-haired thunder see to that!\").<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\"/>\n\nA Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away [[troll]]s and {{lang|non|j\u00f6tnar|italic=no}} appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\".<ref name=\"LINDOW89\">See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states, \"The dread entertained by the Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor, the god of thunder, being the deadly foe of their race.\"</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[The Sagas of Veluwe]] has a story called ''Ontstaan van het Uddeler- en Bleeke meer'' which features Thor and that he fights giants.<ref>Weggelaar, Eva.

It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. ... Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.<ref name=\"DAVIDSON12-13\">Davidson (1965:12\u201413).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSwastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age, such as the 3rd century [[Alu (runic)#V\u00e6rl\u00f8se Fibula|{{lang|da|V\u00e6rl\u00f8se|nocat=yes|italic=no}} Fibula]] (DR EM85;123) from [[Zealand]], Denmark; the [[Goths|Gothic]] spearhead from [[Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus; numerous Migration Period [[bracteate]]s; cremation urns from early [[Anglo-Saxon England]]; the 8th century [[S\u00e6b\u00f8 sword|{{lang|da|S\u00e6b\u00f8|nocat=yes|italic=no}} sword]] from {{lang|no|[[Sogn]]|italic=no}}, Norway; and the 9th century [[Snoldelev Stone]] (DR 248) from {{lang|da|[[Rams\u00f8]]|italic=no}}, Denmark.\n\n==Eponymy and toponymy==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Thorsager-Denmark-city-limit-sign.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = A city limit sign marking {{lang|da|[[Thorsager]]|italic=no}} (\"Thor's Acre\"), Denmark\n| image2    = Thursley Village Sign - geograph.org.uk - 691939.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| width2    = \n| caption2  = Sign for the village of [[Thursley]] in Surrey, England\n}}\nNumerous place names in [[Scandinavia]] contain the Old Norse name {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}}. The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements {{lang|non|-v\u00e9}} (signifying the location of a {{lang|non|[[v\u00e9]]|italic=no}}, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), {{lang|non|\u2013h\u00f3f}} (a structure used for religious purposes, see [[heathen hofs]]), and {{lang|non|\u2013lundr}} (a [[Sacred_trees_and_groves_in_Germanic_paganism_and_mythology|holy grove]]).

Thor also appears in many placenames in [[Uppland]].\n\nIn [[English placenames]], Old English {{lang|ang|Thunor}} (in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name, later introduced to the [[Danelaw]]) left comparatively few traces. Examples include [[Thundersley]], from *{{lang|ang|Thunores hl\u00e6w}} and ''Thurstable'' (Old English \"Thunor's pillar\").<ref name=\"SIMEK321\"/> F. M.

(Compare [[Thunderstone (folklore)|Thunderstones]].) Similarly, [[meteorites]] may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight. On the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], a species of beetle (''Scarab\u00e6us stercorarius'') was named after the god; the {{lang|is|Thorbagge}}. When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over, Thor's favor may be gained. In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as {{lang|is|Thordedjefvul}} or {{lang|is|Thordyfvel}} (both meaning \"Thor-devil\").<ref name=\"THORPE-1851-51-54\">Thorpe (1851:51\u201454).</ref>\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretations==\nThor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] [[Taranis]],<ref>De Vries (1957:111).</ref><ref name=\"SIMEK322\">Simek (2007:322).</ref> the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] {{lang|lt|[[Perk\u016bnas]]|italic=no}}, the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[Perun]],<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:96\u201397).</ref> and particularly the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Indra]]|italic=no}}, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the {{lang|sa-Latn|[[vajra]]|italic=no}} are obvious parallels.

Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile.

Besides [[Old Norse]] ''\u00de\u00f3rr'', extensions of the god occur in [[Old English]] as {{lang|ang|\u00deunor}} and in [[Old High German]] as {{lang|goh|Donar}} ([[continental runic inscriptions|runic]] {{Runic|\u16a6\u16df\u16be\u16a8\u16b1}} {{lang|goh|\u00feonar}}). All forms of the deity stem from a [[Common Germanic]] {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deunraz}} (meaning ''thunder''). \n\nThor is a prominently mentioned god throughout the [[recorded history]] of the [[Germanic peoples]], from the [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] of regions of {{lang|la|[[Germania]]|italic=no}}, to the tribal expansions of the [[Migration Period]], to his high popularity during the [[Viking Age]], when, in the face of the process of the [[Christianization of Scandinavia]], emblems of his hammer, {{lang|is|[[Mj\u00f6lnir]]|italic=no}}, were worn and [[Norse paganism|Norse pagan]] [[personal name]]s containing the name of the god bear witness to his popularity.\n\nDue to the nature of the Germanic corpus, narratives featuring Thor are only attested in Old Norse, where Thor appears throughout [[Norse mythology]]. Norse mythology, largely recorded in [[Iceland]] from traditional material stemming from Scandinavia, provides numerous tales featuring the god. In these sources, Thor bears at least [[List of names of Thor|fifteen names]], is the husband of the golden-haired goddess {{lang|non|[[Sif]]|italic=no}}, is the lover of the {{lang|non|[[j\u00f6tunn]] [[J\u00e1rnsaxa]]|italic=no}}, and is generally described as fierce eyed, [[red hair]]ed and red bearded.<ref name=\"HAIR-COLOR\">On the red beard and the use of \"Redbeard\" as an epithet for Thor, see [[Hilda Ellis Davidson|H.R.

Thor is frequently referred to in place names, the day of the week [[Thursday]] bears his name (modern English ''Thursday'' derives from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|\u00de\u016bnresd\u00e6g}}, '\u00deunor's day'), and names stemming from the pagan period containing his own continue to be used today, particularly in Scandinavia. Thor has inspired numerous works of art and references to Thor appear in modern popular culture. Like other Germanic deities, veneration of Thor is revived in the modern period in [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]].\n\n==Name==\nOld Norse {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} ({{script|Runr|{{lang|non|\u16a6\u16a2\u16b1|italic=no}}}}), Old English {{lang|ang|\u00f0unor}}, [[Old High German]] {{lang|goh|Donar}}, [[Old Saxon]] {{lang|osx|thunar}}, and [[Old Frisian]] {{lang|ofs|thuner}} are [[Cognate|cognates]] within the [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] branch. They descend from the [[Proto-Germanic]] masculine noun {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00feunraz}} 'thunder',<ref name=\"OREL-429\">Orel (2003:429).</ref> and ultimately from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word for 'thunder' ''*(s)tenh\u2082-'', with another cognate in the Celtic god [[Taranis]] (''*Torano'')''.''<ref>Matasovi\u0107 (2009:384).</ref>\n\nThe name of the god is the origin of the weekday name ''[[Thursday]]''. By employing a practice known as {{lang|la|[[Interpretatio_graeca#Interpretatio_germanica|interpretatio germanica]]}} during the [[Roman Empire period]], the Germanic peoples adopted the Roman weekly calendar, and replaced the names of Roman gods with their own. Latin {{lang|la|dies Iovis}} ('day of Jupiter') was converted into Proto-Germanic {{lang|gem-x-proto|\u00deonares dagaz}} (\"Thor's day\"), from which stems modern English \"Thursday\" and all other Germanic weekday cognates.<ref name=\"SIMEK333\">Simek (2007:333).</ref>\n\nBeginning in the [[Viking Age]], [[personal name]]s containing the [[theonym]] {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}} are recorded with great frequency. Prior to the Viking Age, no examples are recorded. {{lang|non|Th\u00f3rr}}-based names may have flourished during the Viking Age as a defiant response to attempts at Christianization, similar to the wide scale Viking Age practice of wearing Thor's hammer pendants.<ref name=\"SIMEK321\">Simek (2007:321).</ref>\n\n==Historical attestations==\n===Roman era===\n[[File:Hermannsweg02.jpg|thumb|The [[Teutoburg Forest]] in northwestern Germany]]\nThe earliest records of the Germanic peoples were recorded by the Romans, and in these works Thor is frequently referred to \u2013 via a process known as {{lang|la|[[interpretatio romana]]}} (where characteristics perceived to be similar by Romans result in identification of a non-Roman god as a Roman deity) \u2013 as either the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (also known as ''Jove'') or the [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman]] [[god]] [[Hercules]]. The first clear example of this occurs in the Roman historian [[Tacitus]]'s late first-century work {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]|italic=yes}}, where, writing about the religion of the {{lang|la|[[Suebi]]|italic=no}} (a confederation of [[Germanic peoples]]), he comments that \"among the gods Mercury is the one they principally worship. They regard it as a religious duty to offer to him, on fixed days, human as well as other sacrificial victims. Hercules and Mars they appease by animal offerings of the permitted kind\" and adds that a portion of the {{lang|la|Suebi|italic=no}} also venerate \"[[Isis]]\".<ref name=\"BIRLEY42\">Birley (1999:42).</ref> In this instance, Tacitus refers to the god [[Odin]] as \"[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]\", Thor as \"Hercules\", and the god {{lang|non|[[T\u00fdr]]|italic=no}} as \"[[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]\", and the identity of the [[Isis]] of the Suebi has been debated. In Thor's case, the identification with the god Hercules is likely at least in part due to similarities between Thor's hammer and Hercules' club.<ref name=\"BIRLEY107\">Birley (1999:107).</ref> In his ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'', Tacitus again refers to the veneration of \"Hercules\" by the Germanic peoples; he records a wood beyond the river [[Weser]] (in what is now northwestern [[Germany]]) as dedicated to him.<ref name=\"BIRLEY41\">Birley (1999:42 and 106\u2014107).</ref>\n\nIn Germanic areas occupied by the [[Roman Empire]], coins and votive objects dating from the 2nd and 3rd century AD have been found with Latin inscriptions referring to \"Hercules\", and so in reality, with varying levels of likelihood, refer to Thor by way of {{lang|la|interpretatio romana}}.<ref name=\"SIMEK140-142\">Simek (2007:140\u2014142).</ref>\n\n===Post-Roman era{{anchor|Post-Roman_era}}===\n{{redirect|Donar}}\n[[File:Bonifacius by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|[[Boniface]] bears his crucifix after felling Thor's Oak in ''Bonifacius'' (1905) by [[Emil Doepler]]]]\nThe first recorded instance of the name of the god appears in the [[Migration Period]], where a piece of jewelry (a [[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]), the [[Nordendorf fibula]], dating from the 7th century AD and found in [[Bavaria]], bears an [[Elder Futhark]] inscription that contains the name {{lang|goh|\u00deonar}}, i.e. {{lang|goh|Donar}}, the southern Germanic form of Thor's name.<ref name=\"SIMEK235-236\">Simek (2007:235\u2014236).</ref>\n\nAccording to a near-contemporary account, the Christian missionary [[Saint Boniface]] felled an [[oak tree]] dedicated to \"Jove\" in the 8th century, the [[Donar's Oak]] in the region of [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].<ref name=SIMEK238>Simek (2007:238) and Robinson (1916:63).</ref>\n\nAround the second half of the 8th century, [[Old English]] mentions of a figure named {{lang|ang|Thunor}} ({{lang|ang|\u00deunor}}) are recorded, a figure who likely refers to a [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Saxon]] version of the god. In relation, {{lang|ang|Thunor}} is sometimes used in Old English texts to gloss ''Jupiter'', the god may be referenced in the poem ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]'', where the thunder strikes the devil with a \"fiery axe\", and the Old English expression {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} (\"thunder ride\") may refer to the god's thunderous, goat-led chariot.<ref name=\"TURVILLE99\">Turville-Petre (1964:99)</ref><ref name=\"THUNOR\">See North (1998:238\u2014241) for {{lang|ang|\u00feunnorad}} and tales regarding {{lang|ang|Thunor}}, see ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' (1910:608) regarding usage of {{lang|ang|Thunor}} as an Old English gloss for ''Jupiter'' and {{lang|ang|[[T\u00fdr|Tiw]]}} employed as a gloss for ''Mars''.</ref>\n\nA 9th-century AD codex from [[Mainz]], Germany, known as the ''[[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]'', records the name of three Old Saxon gods, {{lang|osx|UU\u00f4den}} (Old Saxon \"[[Wodan]]\"), {{lang|osx|[[Seaxn\u0113at|Saxn\u00f4te]]}}, and {{lang|osx|Thunaer}}, by way of their renunciation as demons in a formula to be repeated by Germanic pagans formally [[christianization of the Germanic peoples|converting to Christianity]].<ref name=\"SIMEK276\">Simek (2007:276).</ref>\n\nThe [[Kentish royal legend]], probably 11th-century, contains the story of a villainous reeve of [[Ecgberht of Kent]] called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as {{lang|ang|\u00feunores hl\u00e6we}} (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). [[Gabriel Turville-Petre]] saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:99\u2013100); variant texts in mss.

Adam details that the people of {{lang|sv|Uppsala|italic=no}} had appointed [[gothi|priests]] to each of the gods, and that the priests were to offer up [[bl\u00f3t|sacrifices]].

Early depictions portray Olaf as clean-shaven, but after 1200 he appears with a red beard.{{sfn|Lindahl|McNamara|Lindow|2002|p=299}} For centuries, Olaf figured in folk traditions as a slayer of [[troll]]s and giants, and as a protector against malicious forces.{{sfn|Ast\u00e5s|1993|p=446}}\n\n===Modern folklore===\nTales about Thor, or influenced by native traditions regarding Thor, continued into the modern period, particularly in Scandinavia. Writing in the 19th century, scholar [[Jacob Grimm]] records various phrases surviving into Germanic languages that refer to the god, such as the Norwegian {{lang|no|Thorsvarme}} (\"Thor's warmth\") for lightning and the Swedish {{lang|sv|godgubben \u00e5far}} (\"The good old (fellow) is taking a ride\") as well as the word {{wikt-lang|sv|tord\u00f6n}} (\"Thor's rumble\" or \"Thor's thunder\") when it thunders. Grimm comments that, at times, Scandinavians often \"no longer liked to utter the god's real name, or they wished to extol his fatherly goodness\".<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\">Grimm (1882:166\u201477).</ref>\n\nThor remained pictured as a red-bearded figure, as evident by the Danish rhyme that yet referred to him as {{lang|da|Thor med sit lange sk\u00e6g}} (\"Thor with the long beard\") and the [[North-Frisia]]n curse {{lang|frr|diis ruadhiiret donner regiir!}} (\"let red-haired thunder see to that!\").<ref name=\"GRIMM166-177\"/>\n\nA Scandinavian folk belief that lightning frightens away [[troll]]s and {{lang|non|j\u00f6tnar|italic=no}} appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, and may be a late reflection of Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and ettins in modern Scandinavia is explained as a result of the \"accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes\".<ref name=\"LINDOW89\">See Lindow (1978:89), but noted as early as Thorpe (1851:154) who states, \"The dread entertained by the Trolls for thunder dates from the time of paganism, Thor, the god of thunder, being the deadly foe of their race.\"</ref>\n\nIn the Netherlands, [[The Sagas of Veluwe]] has a story called ''Ontstaan van het Uddeler- en Bleeke meer'' which features Thor and that he fights giants.<ref>Weggelaar, Eva.

It seems to have been used by the warrior also, in the form of the swastika. ... Primarily it appears to have had connections with light and fire, and to have been linked with the sun-wheel. It may have been on account of Thor's association with lightning that this sign was used as an alternative to the hammer, for it is found on memorial stones in Scandinavia besides inscriptions to Thor. When we find it on the pommel of a warrior's sword and on his sword-belt, the assumption is that the warrior was placing himself under the Thunder God's protection.<ref name=\"DAVIDSON12-13\">Davidson (1965:12\u201413).</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSwastikas appear on various Germanic objects stretching from the Migration Period to the Viking Age, such as the 3rd century [[Alu (runic)#V\u00e6rl\u00f8se Fibula|{{lang|da|V\u00e6rl\u00f8se|nocat=yes|italic=no}} Fibula]] (DR EM85;123) from [[Zealand]], Denmark; the [[Goths|Gothic]] spearhead from [[Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus; numerous Migration Period [[bracteate]]s; cremation urns from early [[Anglo-Saxon England]]; the 8th century [[S\u00e6b\u00f8 sword|{{lang|da|S\u00e6b\u00f8|nocat=yes|italic=no}} sword]] from {{lang|no|[[Sogn]]|italic=no}}, Norway; and the 9th century [[Snoldelev Stone]] (DR 248) from {{lang|da|[[Rams\u00f8]]|italic=no}}, Denmark.\n\n==Eponymy and toponymy==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Thorsager-Denmark-city-limit-sign.jpg\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = A city limit sign marking {{lang|da|[[Thorsager]]|italic=no}} (\"Thor's Acre\"), Denmark\n| image2    = Thursley Village Sign - geograph.org.uk - 691939.jpg\n| alt2      = \n| width2    = \n| caption2  = Sign for the village of [[Thursley]] in Surrey, England\n}}\nNumerous place names in [[Scandinavia]] contain the Old Norse name {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}}. The identification of these place names as pointing to religious significance is complicated by the aforementioned common usage of {{lang|non|\u00de\u00f3rr}} as a personal name element. Cultic significance may only be assured in place names containing the elements {{lang|non|-v\u00e9}} (signifying the location of a {{lang|non|[[v\u00e9]]|italic=no}}, a type of pagan Germanic shrine), {{lang|non|\u2013h\u00f3f}} (a structure used for religious purposes, see [[heathen hofs]]), and {{lang|non|\u2013lundr}} (a [[Sacred_trees_and_groves_in_Germanic_paganism_and_mythology|holy grove]]).

Thor also appears in many placenames in [[Uppland]].\n\nIn [[English placenames]], Old English {{lang|ang|Thunor}} (in contrast with the Old Norse form of the name, later introduced to the [[Danelaw]]) left comparatively few traces. Examples include [[Thundersley]], from *{{lang|ang|Thunores hl\u00e6w}} and ''Thurstable'' (Old English \"Thunor's pillar\").<ref name=\"SIMEK321\"/> F. M.

(Compare [[Thunderstone (folklore)|Thunderstones]].) Similarly, [[meteorites]] may be considered memorials to Thor in folk tradition due to their sheer weight. On the Swedish island of [[Gotland]], a species of beetle (''Scarab\u00e6us stercorarius'') was named after the god; the {{lang|is|Thorbagge}}. When the beetle is found turned upside down and one flips it over, Thor's favor may be gained. In other regions of Sweden the name of the beetle appears to have been demonized with Christianization, where the insect came to be known as {{lang|is|Thordedjefvul}} or {{lang|is|Thordyfvel}} (both meaning \"Thor-devil\").<ref name=\"THORPE-1851-51-54\">Thorpe (1851:51\u201454).</ref>\n\n==Origin, theories, and interpretations==\nThor closely resembles other Indo-European deities associated with the thunder: the [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]] [[Taranis]],<ref>De Vries (1957:111).</ref><ref name=\"SIMEK322\">Simek (2007:322).</ref> the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] {{lang|lt|[[Perk\u016bnas]]|italic=no}}, the [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]] [[Perun]],<ref>Turville-Petre (1964:96\u201397).</ref> and particularly the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] {{lang|sa-Latn|[[Indra]]|italic=no}}, whose red hair and thunderbolt weapon the {{lang|sa-Latn|[[vajra]]|italic=no}} are obvious parallels.

Thor's marriage with {{lang|non|Sif|italic=no}} of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of [[hieros gamos|divine marriage]] between [[sky deity|sky god]] and [[earth goddess]], when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile.

The book contends to be \"the inside story of the most tyrannical and unprincipled papacy of modern times,\" arguing that Pope Francis, while presenting himself as humble, rules over the Church through fear and has allied to some of the most corrupt elements in the [[Holy See|Vatican]].
