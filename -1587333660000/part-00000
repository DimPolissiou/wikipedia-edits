However, Sgr&nbsp;dSph still has coherence as a dispersed elongated ellipse, and appears to move in a roughly polar orbit around the Milky Way as close as 50,000&nbsp;light-years from the galactic core. Although it may have begun as a spherical object before falling towards the Milky Way, Sgr&nbsp;dSph is now being torn apart by immense tidal forces over hundreds of millions of years. Numerical simulations suggest that stars ripped out from the dwarf would be spread out in a long [[Stellar kinematics#Stellar streams|stellar stream]] along its path, which were subsequently detected.\n\nHowever, some astronomers contend that Sgr&nbsp;dSph has been in orbit around the Milky Way for some billions of years, and has already orbited it approximately ten times. Its ability to retain some coherence despite such strains would indicate an unusually high concentration of [[dark matter]] within that galaxy.\n\nIn 1999, Johnston et al. concluded that Sgr&nbsp;dSph has orbited the Milky Way for at least one [[Gya]] and that during that time its mass has decreased by a factor of two or three. Its orbit is found to have [[galactocentric distance]]s that oscillate between ~13 and ~41&nbsp;kpc with a period of 550 to 750&nbsp;million years. The last [[Apsis|perigalacticon]] was approximately fifty million years ago. Also in 1999, Jiang & Binney found that it may have started its infall into the Milky Way at a point more than 200&nbsp;kpc away if its starting mass was as large as ~10<sup>11</sup>{{Solar mass|link=y}}.\n\nThe models of both its orbit and the Milky Way's potential field could be improved by [[proper motion]] observations of Sgr&nbsp;dSph's stellar debris. This issue is under intense investigation, with computational support by the [[MilkyWay@Home]] project.\n\nA simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral structure as a result of repeated collisions with Sgr&nbsp;dSph.<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n\nIn 2018 the Gaia project of the European Space Agency, designed primarily to investigate the origin, evolution and structure of the Milky Way, delivered the largest and most precise census of positions, velocities and other stellar properties of more than a billion stars, which showed that Sgr&nbsp;dSph had caused perturbations in a set of stars near the Milky Way's core, causing unexpected rippling movements of the stars triggered when it sailed past the Milky Way between 300 and 900&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=\"Nature\"/>\n\nA 2019 study by Melendez and co-authors concluded that Sgr&nbsp;dSph had a decreasing metallicity trend as a function of radius, with a larger spread in metallicity in the core relative to the outer regions. Also, they did find evidence for the first time for two distinct populations in alpha abundances as a function of metallicity.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Melendez |first2=Peter M. |last2=Frinchaboy |first3=John |last3=Donor |first4=Amy |last4=Ray |title=Using The Cannon to study the chemistry of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy |url=https://srs.tcu.edu/media/uploads/2019/PHYS2018MELENDEZ55573.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Matthew Melendez explores a small galaxy that is falling into our own |date=April 13, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_muUkbm-yws |work=TCU Astronomy and Physics |via=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Messier 54]]\n* [[Omega Centauri]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://messier.seds.org/more/sagdeg.html |title=SagDEG |website=SEDS}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.solstation.com/x-objects/sag-deg.htm |title=SagDEG |website=solstation.com}}\n* {{cite media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pig-uqRehNM |title=Simulation showing Sgr&nbsp;dSph impacts causing spiral arms of Milky Way |medium=video |via=YouTube.com}}\n* {{CelestialRefEx|Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy}}\n\n{{Milky Way}}\n{{Sky|18|55|19.5|-|30|32|43|65000}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarf galaxies]]\n[[Category:Dwarf elliptical galaxies]]\n[[Category:Dwarf spheroidal galaxies]]\n[[Category:Sagittarius (constellation)]]\n[[Category:Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy|*]]\n[[Category:Local Group]]\n[[Category:Milky Way Subgroup]]\n[[Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1994]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy}}\n{{short description|Dwarf galaxy}}\n{{Infobox galaxy\n| image    = The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy in Gaia's all-sky view ESA399651.jpg\n| caption  = The Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in Aitoff allsky view.\n| name     = Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy<ref name=\"SIMBAD\">{{cite simbad\n  |title      = Name SDG\n  |access-date = {{date|2006-11-28|dmy}} }}</ref>\n| epoch    = [[Epoch (astronomy)#Julian years and J2000|J2000]]\n| type     = dSph(t)<ref name=\"NED\">{{cite web\n  |title      = Saggitarius Dwarf Spheroidal\n  |work       = [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database]]\n  |url        = http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/objsearch?objname=Sagittarius+Dwarf+Spheroidal\n  |accessdate = {{date|2006-11-28|dmy}} }}</ref>\n| ra       = {{RA|18|55|19.5}}<ref name=\"NED\" />\n| dec      = {{DEC|-30|32|43}}<ref name=\"NED\" />\n| dist_ly  = [[1 E20 m|65 \u00b1 7]] [[light-year|kly]] (20 \u00b1 2 [[parsec|kpc]])<ref name=\"Karachentsev et al. 2004\">{{cite journal\n  |last1      = Karachentsev |first1 = I.

Although it is one of the closest companion galaxies to the Milky Way, the main parent cluster is on the opposite side of the [[Galactic center|galactic core]] from Earth, and consequently is very faint, although covering a large area of the sky.  Sgr&nbsp;dSph appears to be an older galaxy, with little interstellar dust and composed largely of [[Population II]] stars, older and metal-poor, as compared to the Milky Way.

However, Sgr&nbsp;dSph still has coherence as a dispersed elongated ellipse, and appears to move in a roughly polar orbit around the Milky Way as close as 50,000&nbsp;light-years from the galactic core. Although it may have begun as a spherical object before falling towards the Milky Way, Sgr&nbsp;dSph is now being torn apart by immense tidal forces over hundreds of millions of years. Numerical simulations suggest that stars ripped out from the dwarf would be spread out in a long [[Stellar kinematics#Stellar streams|stellar stream]] along its path, which were subsequently detected.\n\nHowever, some astronomers contend that Sgr&nbsp;dSph has been in orbit around the Milky Way for some billions of years, and has already orbited it approximately ten times. Its ability to retain some coherence despite such strains would indicate an unusually high concentration of [[dark matter]] within that galaxy.\n\nIn 1999, Johnston et al. concluded that Sgr&nbsp;dSph has orbited the Milky Way for at least one [[Gya]] and that during that time its mass has decreased by a factor of two or three. Its orbit is found to have [[galactocentric distance]]s that oscillate between ~13 and ~41&nbsp;kpc with a period of 550 to 750&nbsp;million years. The last [[Apsis|perigalacticon]] was approximately fifty million years ago. Also in 1999, Jiang & Binney found that it may have started its infall into the Milky Way at a point more than 200&nbsp;kpc away if its starting mass was as large as ~10<sup>11</sup>{{Solar mass|link=y}}.\n\nThe models of both its orbit and the Milky Way's potential field could be improved by [[proper motion]] observations of Sgr&nbsp;dSph's stellar debris. This issue is under intense investigation, with computational support by the [[MilkyWay@Home]] project.\n\nA simulation published in 2011 suggested that the Milky Way may have obtained its spiral structure as a result of repeated collisions with Sgr&nbsp;dSph.<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n\nIn 2018 the Gaia project of the European Space Agency, designed primarily to investigate the origin, evolution and structure of the Milky Way, delivered the largest and most precise census of positions, velocities and other stellar properties of more than a billion stars, which showed that Sgr&nbsp;dSph had caused perturbations in a set of stars near the Milky Way's core, causing unexpected rippling movements of the stars triggered when it sailed past the Milky Way between 300 and 900&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=\"Nature\"/>\n\nA 2019 study by Melendez and co-authors concluded that Sgr&nbsp;dSph had a decreasing metallicity trend as a function of radius, with a larger spread in metallicity in the core relative to the outer regions. Also, they did find evidence for the first time for two distinct populations in alpha abundances as a function of metallicity.<ref>{{cite web |first=Matthew |last=Melendez |first2=Peter M. |last2=Frinchaboy |first3=John |last3=Donor |first4=Amy |last4=Ray |title=Using The Cannon to study the chemistry of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy |url=https://srs.tcu.edu/media/uploads/2019/PHYS2018MELENDEZ55573.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Matthew Melendez explores a small galaxy that is falling into our own |date=April 13, 2019 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_muUkbm-yws |work=TCU Astronomy and Physics |via=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Messier 54]]\n* [[Omega Centauri]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://messier.seds.org/more/sagdeg.html |title=SagDEG |website=SEDS}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.solstation.com/x-objects/sag-deg.htm |title=SagDEG |website=solstation.com}}\n* {{cite media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pig-uqRehNM |title=Simulation showing Sgr&nbsp;dSph impacts causing spiral arms of Milky Way |medium=video |via=YouTube.com}}\n* {{CelestialRefEx|Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy}}\n\n{{Milky Way}}\n{{Sky|18|55|19.5|-|30|32|43|65000}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarf galaxies]]\n[[Category:Dwarf elliptical galaxies]]\n[[Category:Dwarf spheroidal galaxies]]\n[[Category:Sagittarius (constellation)]]\n[[Category:Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy|*]]\n[[Category:Local Group]]\n[[Category:Milky Way Subgroup]]\n[[Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1994]]\n", "name_user": "Cyberkagami", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_Dwarf_Spheroidal_Galaxy"}

She was the third daughter of Mir Seyed Razi Semnani, also known as Reyis Al-Atabeh, and Mirza Ibrahim Amid al-Saltanah. Her father was doctor to the then Shah of Persia, [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], and the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]]. Amid received her primary education from her father. Later, she studied French and photography.<ref name=\":0\" /> Her family arranged for her to be married to the Hosseini Prince Mirza Emad al-Saltanah Salvar when she was 16.

Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, an all-girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month.\n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and fundamental way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died of a heart attack in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown, [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]].

{"title_page": "King John and the Bishop", "text_new": "\"'''King John and the Bishop'''\" is an English [[folk-song]] dating back at least{{clarify|reason=at the earliest? at the latest?|date=August 2018}} to the 16th century. It is catalogued in [[Child Ballads]] as number 45 and [[Roud Folk Song Index]] 302.\n\n<!--The song recounts the poor relationship between [[John of England|King John]] and the archbishop of Canterbury, but is also an example of a [[riddle]]-song. -->\nIt tells how [[John of England|King John]], covetous of the bishop of Canterbury's wealth, compels him on pain of death to answer three impossible questions. The bishop's shepherd appears in disguise to substitute in his place, and answers the questions cleverly in [[riddle]] fashion, after which the appeased king rewards the shepherd and spares the bishop. Like the ballad, historical King John had a reputation of confiscating property from the clergy.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">{{Harvnb|Philips|1723|loc=''Old Ballads'' II, pp.49-50}}, in commentary to the ballad: \"..when [King John] had taken a Mind to any Man's Estate, (especially a Churchman's, for those he frequently chased)\" it would have been out of character for him to as allow as much as three days to his victim, or so the anthologist has heard from skeptics who felt the ballad must have originally featured some other monarch.</ref>\n\nThe ballad is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] folktale type \"AT 922\" of the shepherd substituting for the priest to answer the king's questions (For analogues, see [[#Parallels|Parallels]] below). Analogues are widespread, some of them being literary works dating to medieval times<!--REWRITTEN FROM:It is theoretically possible that it began as mythic folk tale, and was superimposed onto a story from history and then written as a song.-->.<!--CAN'T FIND THIS CLAIM: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry.-->\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[John of England|King John]] in the opening lines is described as a man did much wrong and did little to uphold what was right. Enraged that the bishop (variant B, the abbot) of [[Canterbury]] maintained a household with many servants and riches paid by comfortable income, the king summons him to court, accuses him of treason, threatening him with beheading and the confiscation of income afterwards, unless the cleric can correctly answer three questions:\n\n*How long does it take to travel the whole world?\n*How much money am I worth?\n*What am I thinking?\n\nThe king sends the bishop off, allowing a thinking period of twenty days (B, three days).<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In A he then rides to Oxford and Cambridge seeking learned men to give him the right answer, only to be derided. In B he rides straight to his country home.</ref> The distressed bishop returns to his shepherd (who in A is his own half-brother), and confides his dilemma. The shepherd says, \"Lend me your clothes, I will deliver the correct answers for you\". The disguised shepherd then meets King John. His answers are:\n\n*A twenty-four-hour day. If you rise in the morning and follow the sun's movement the whole day long, until you wait for the sun to come up in the same place the following morning. Then you'll have traveled the world around. \n*[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] sold [[Christ]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]]. You are worth almost as much as Christ. You are worth 29 pieces of silver.\n*You are thinking I am the bishop of Canterbury. In fact I am a shepherd in disguise.\n\nImpressed by the clever response, the king offers the appointment of the shepherd as bishop. This the shepherd diffidently declines, at which the king awards him a monetary pension, and pardons the bishop as well.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In B, the pension is four pounds per week, which calculates to a larger sum. In A, the king offers 300 pounds a year, the brother offers 50 more, and the shepherd declares he no longer will tolerate keeping sheep for his brother.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nOn the one hand the song is an oblique reference to the poor relationship between King John and the archbishop of Canterbury. On the other hand, it can be enjoyed as a clever [[riddle]]-song. <!--DUBIOUS OR MISWORDED: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry. (see [[Exeter Book]] and [[Anglo-Saxon literature]]). -->\n\n===The ''Derry down'' refrain===\nThe \"Derry down\" chorus belongs very much to the sixteenth century, and occurs in many ballads.<ref>\"Derry down\" occurs in ''The Huntsman's Delight; or The Forester's Pleasure'', ''Roxburghe ballads'' Vol. VII, p.557- with the lines \"Derry derry down/Among the leaves so green O\" is referred to by the title \"The Keeper\" by some sources.</ref> William Chappell ventured to guess that the ballad entitled \"A defence for [[wikt:milkmaids|Mylkemaydes]] against the terme of [[wikt:malkin|Mawken]]\" (before 1563-4), with the refrain \"Down, a-downe, &c.\" might have been set to the same tune.<!--RS BUT OFF TOPIC?--><!--UNRELIABLE SOURCE ELABORATES: A website dedicated to the printed books of William Chappell (\"Popular music of Olden Time\") suggests that milkmaids frequently sang as they went milking. The explanation of the \"Derry down, down hey, derry down\" might be the milkmaids pulling the cow teats down. (see [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/popular-music-olden-times-1/popular-music-of-olden-times1%20-%200449.htm Olden Times]). However no other site endorses this theory.-->\n\n===Historical Background===\nKing John's father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], indirectly made a martyr of [[Thomas Becket|Thomas a Beckett]]. Like his father, John had a conflict with the Catholic Church, and refused to ratify the Pope's choice for the post of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. The Pope responded with bureaucratic constraints, and in retaliation John removed from office several bishops.\n\nThe idea that a shepherd, or the lesser brother of a bishop, could out-wit a king, is quite subversive. Most of the [[Robin Hood]] ballads have the same characteristics, except that the sheriff is in place of the king. King John is closely associated with Robin Hood, so perhaps this is not a coincidence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere is also the suggestion that the educated bishop (or abbot) is not as wise as the uneducated brother (or shepherd) - implying there is a \"native wit\" that is more valuable than school-book wisdom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe song has been found in England, Scotland, and the United States.<ref name=\"waltz\">{{cite web|author1=Robert B.

The tale appears in English under the title \"The Priest and the Clerk\" (Dasent tr.) or \"The Parson and The Sexton\" (Patrick Shaw Iversen tr.). In the folktale, a priest who is in the habit of shouting everyone else to swerve when he is travelling the road gets in trouble by behaving the same way before the king, who threatens to defrock him if he is not competent to answer them. The priest condescendingly says a fool can stump ten wise men with questions, and refuses to the king, so his clerk makes the appearance. When asked \"How far the east is from west?\" the clerk replies \"A day's journey,\" for that is the course the sun takes between rising and setting. The king's worth? -- No more than 29 silver pieces (''{{linktext|S\u00f8lv|penge}}'') since Christ was worth [[thirty pieces of silver]]. The king's thought? -- that the priest stands before him, but he must stand corrected for he is the clerk.

A tune of this title appears in the [[Stationers' Register]] of 1568/9. The title is also mentioned in a play of 1560. The words that accompany this tune are a witty comparison between the bedsheets (a dance of life) and the winding sheets (the dance of death). \"Shaking of the sheets\" is sung by [[Steeleye Span]] on the album ''[[Tempted and Tried]]'' and by [[The City Waites]] on ''Ghosts, Witches and Demons'' (1995).\n\n[[John Playford]]'s 1650 manual ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' gives the tune as \"The Night Peece\".

Like the ballad, historical King John had a reputation of confiscating property from the clergy.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">{{Harvnb|Philips|1723|loc=''Old Ballads'' II, pp.49-50}}, in commentary to the ballad: \"..when [King John] had taken a Mind to any Man's Estate, (especially a Churchman's, for those he frequently chased)\" it would have been out of character for him to as allow as much as three days to his victim, or so the anthologist has heard from skeptics who felt the ballad must have originally featured some other monarch.</ref>\n\nThe ballad is classified as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] folktale type \"AT 922\" of the shepherd substituting for the priest to answer the king's questions (For analogues, see [[#Parallels|Parallels]] below). Analogues are widespread, some of them being literary works dating to medieval times<!--REWRITTEN FROM:It is theoretically possible that it began as mythic folk tale, and was superimposed onto a story from history and then written as a song.-->.<!--CAN'T FIND THIS CLAIM: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry.-->\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[John of England|King John]] in the opening lines is described as a man did much wrong and did little to uphold what was right. Enraged that the bishop (variant B, the abbot) of [[Canterbury]] maintained a household with many servants and riches paid by comfortable income, the king summons him to court, accuses him of treason, threatening him with beheading and the confiscation of income afterwards, unless the cleric can correctly answer three questions:\n\n*How long does it take to travel the whole world?\n*How much money am I worth?\n*What am I thinking?\n\nThe king sends the bishop off, allowing a thinking period of twenty days (B, three days).<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In A he then rides to Oxford and Cambridge seeking learned men to give him the right answer, only to be derided. In B he rides straight to his country home.</ref> The distressed bishop returns to his shepherd (who in A is his own half-brother), and confides his dilemma. The shepherd says, \"Lend me your clothes, I will deliver the correct answers for you\". The disguised shepherd then meets King John. His answers are:\n\n*A twenty-four-hour day. If you rise in the morning and follow the sun's movement the whole day long, until you wait for the sun to come up in the same place the following morning. Then you'll have traveled the world around. \n*[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] sold [[Christ]] for [[thirty pieces of silver]]. You are worth almost as much as Christ. You are worth 29 pieces of silver.\n*You are thinking I am the bishop of Canterbury. In fact I am a shepherd in disguise.\n\nImpressed by the clever response, the king offers the appointment of the shepherd as bishop. This the shepherd diffidently declines, at which the king awards him a monetary pension, and a pardons the bishop as well.<ref group=\"lower-alpha\">In B, the pension is four pounds per week, which calculates to a larger sum. In A, the king offers 300 pounds a year, the brother offers 50 more, and the shepherd declares he no longer will tolerate keeping sheep for his brother.</ref>\n\n==Commentary==\nOn the one hand the song is an oblique reference to the poor relationship between King John and the archbishop of Canterbury. On the other hand, it can be enjoyed as a clever [[riddle]]-song. <!--DUBIOUS OR MISWORDED: [[Francis James Child]] makes the comment that the roots of this ballad may be much older - perhaps going back to the sixth century, when riddling was a much stronger tradition in English poetry. (see [[Exeter Book]] and [[Anglo-Saxon literature]]). -->\n\n===The ''Derry down'' refrain===\nThe \"Derry down\" chorus belongs very much to the sixteenth century, and occurs in many ballads.<ref>\"Derry down\" occurs in ''The Huntsman's Delight; or The Forester's Pleasure'', ''Roxburghe ballads'' Vol. VII, p.557- with the lines \"Derry derry down/Among the leaves so green O\" is referred to by the title \"The Keeper\" by some sources.</ref> William Chappell ventured to guess that the ballad entitled \"A defence for [[wikt:milkmaids|Mylkemaydes]] against the terme of [[wikt:malkin|Mawken]]\" (before 1563-4), with the refrain \"Down, a-downe, &c.\" might have been set to the same tune.<!--RS BUT OFF TOPIC?--><!--UNRELIABLE SOURCE ELABORATES: A website dedicated to the printed books of William Chappell (\"Popular music of Olden Time\") suggests that milkmaids frequently sang as they went milking. The explanation of the \"Derry down, down hey, derry down\" might be the milkmaids pulling the cow teats down. (see [http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/popular-music-olden-times-1/popular-music-of-olden-times1%20-%200449.htm Olden Times]). However no other site endorses this theory.-->\n\n===Historical Background===\nKing John's father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], indirectly made a martyr of [[Thomas Becket|Thomas a Beckett]]. Like his father, John had a conflict with the Catholic Church, and refused to ratify the Pope's choice for the post of the Archbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton. The Pope responded with bureaucratic constraints, and in retaliation John removed from office several bishops.\n\nThe idea that a shepherd, or the lesser brother of a bishop, could out-wit a king, is quite subversive. Most of the [[Robin Hood]] ballads have the same characteristics, except that the sheriff is in place of the king. King John is closely associated with Robin Hood, so perhaps this is not a coincidence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThere is also the suggestion that the educated bishop (or abbot) is not as wise as the uneducated brother (or shepherd) - implying there is a \"native wit\" that is more valuable than school-book wisdom.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe song has been found in England, Scotland, and the United States.<ref name=\"waltz\">{{cite web|author1=Robert B.

It was printed with this title in 1776 in [[John Hawkins (author)|Hawkins']] ''History of Music''. It also appears as \"Shakinge of the Sheetes\" in William Ballet's lute manuscript. A tune of this title appears in the [[Stationers' Register]] of 1568/9. The title is also mentioned in a play of 1560. The words that accompany this tune are a witty comparison between the bedsheets (a dance of life) and the winding sheets (the dance of death). \"Shaking of the sheets\" is sung by [[Steeleye Span]] on the album ''[[Tempted and Tried]]'' and by [[The City Waites]] on ''Ghosts, Witches and Demons'' (1995).\n\n[[John Playford]]'s 1650 manual ''[[The Dancing Master]]'' gives the tune as \"The Night Peece\". Only with difficulty can the words of the Percy manuscript text, be made to fit this version of the tune. The tune also goes by the name \"Derry Down\". \"The Night Peece\" is the name of a dance in Playford's books.\n\n==Musical adaptations==\nIn 1891 Charles Josph Frost wrote a cantata \"King John and the Abbot of Canterbury\" based on the ballad.\n\n===Other songs with the same tune===\n[[Thomas Baker (attorney)|Thomas Baker]]'s 1703 play ''Tunbridge-Walks; or, The Yeoman of Kent'' contains the ballad, but only the opening verses. This was followed by instances of the tune being used on stage several times over the next 50 years, with different words.
