One of the recurring themes was that Northerners dominated the economy of the region.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Palgrave Macmillan| isbn = 978-3-319-90205-0| pages = 265\u2013292|editor= Lotje de Vries |editor2=Pierre Englebert |editor3=Mareike Schomerus | last = Foucher| first = Vincent| title = Secessionism in African politics aspiration, grievance, performance, disenchantment| chapter = The Mouvement des Forces D\u00e9mocratiques de Casamance: The Illusion of Separatism in Senegal?| location = Cham| date = 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nIn the 1980s, resentment about the marginalization and exploitation of Casamance by the Senegalese central government gave rise to an independence movement in form of the MFDC, which was officially founded in 1982. This initial movement managed to unite Jola and other ethnic groups in the region, such as [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Bainuk people|Bainuk]], and led to rising popular resistance against the government and northerners. The MFDC began to organise demonstrations, and tensions eventually escalated in massive riots in December 1983. The Senegalese government answered by dividing the Casamance province into two smaller regions, probably in order to split and weaken the independence movement. This only heightened tensions, and the government began to jail MFDC leaders such as [[Augustin Diamacoune Senghor]].{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}\n\nAnother factor in the growing independence movement was the failure of the [[Senegambia Confederation]] in 1989, which had economically benefited Casamance and whose end only worsened the situation of Casamance's population.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Flag of Casamance.svg|thumb|left|The [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance|MFDC]] and other separatist groups originally used this horizontal white-green-red tricolor as [[Casamance]]'s national flag{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=396}} ]]\n\nThe discovery of oil in the region emboldened the MFDC to organise mass demonstrations for immediate independence in 1990, which were brutally suppressed by the Senegalese military. This pushed the MFDC into armed rebellion. The following fighting was vicious, and 30,000 civilians were displaced by 1994. Several [[ceasefire]]s were agreed during the 1990s, but none lasted, often also due to splits within the MFDC along ethnic lines and between those ready negotiate and those who refused to lay down their weapons. In 1992 the MFDC divided into two main groups, Front Sud and Front Nord. Whereas Front Sud was dominated by Jola and called for full independence, Front Nord included both Jola as well as non-Jola tribesmen and was ready to work with the government based on a failed agreement of 1991.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=399, 400}} Another ceasefire in 1993 led to the break-off of hardline rebel groups from the MFDC. These continued to attack the military.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}}\n\nThe Senegalese military relocated thousands of soldiers from the northern provinces to Casamance in 1995 in an attempt to finally crush the uprising. The northern soldiers often mistreated the local population and did not differentiate between those who supported the rebels and government loyalists. By this time, the rebels had established bases in [[Guinea-Bissau]], reportedly being supplied with arms by Bissau-Guinean [[Military of Guinea-Bissau|military commander]] [[Ansumane Man\u00e9]]. Man\u00e9's alleged support for the separatists was one factor which led to the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] that erupted in 1998. When Senegal decided to send its military into Guinea-Bissau to fight for the local government against Man\u00e9's forces, the latter and the MFDC formed a full alliance. The two rebel movements started to fight side by side in both Senegal as well as Guinea-Bissau.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}} Although the Senegal-supported government of Guinea-Bissau collapsed, the following MFDC-sympathetic regime was also overthrown in May 1999.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=400, 401}}\n\nIn an renewed offensive against the separatists between April and June 1999, the Senegalese military shelled Casamance's ''de facto'' capital [[Ziguinchor]] for the first time, causing numerous civilian casualties and the displacement of 20,000 people along the Senegal\u2013Guinea-Bissau border. From then on, fighting mostly took place in the eastern [[Kolda Region]]. Another attempt at peace talks started in December 1999, with Senegalese and MFDC representatives meeting in [[Banjul]]. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=401}}\n\n===2000s===\nPeace talks resumed in January 2000, with both sides attempting to end the military conflict and aiming at restoring political and economic normality to Casamance. Discussions were held about the MFDC transforming into a political party, but the talks were hindered by the MFDC's factionalism, and the refusal of the Senegalese government to even consider Casamance's independence. As result, the peace talks collapsed in November 2000, with MFDC leader Augustin Diamacoune Senghor declaring that his group would continue to fight until achieving independence. A new ceasefire was agreed to in March 2001, but failed to stop the conflict. Meanwhile, internal divisions deepened among the MFDC about the movement's aims and Senghor's leadership.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=401}}\n\nOn 30 December 2004, the two sides of the conflict signed a truce, which lasted until August 2006.<ref name=Yari>{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAKAR2012_a.html|title=THE 2004 TRUCE HAS ENDED|work=Wikileaks|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince the split, low-level fighting has continued in the region.

This initial movement managed to unite Jola and other ethnic groups in the region, such as [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Bainuk people|Bainuk]], and led to rising popular resistance against the government and northerners. The MFDC began to organise demonstrations, and tensions eventually escalated in massive riots in December 1983. The Senegalese government answered by dividing the Casamance province into two smaller regions, probably in order to split and weaken the independence movement. This only heightened tensions, and the government began to jail MFDC leaders such as [[Augustin Diamacoune Senghor]].{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}\n\nAnother factor in the growing independence movement was the failure of the [[Senegambia Confederation]] in 1989, which had economically benefited Casamance and whose end only worsened the situation of Casamance's population.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Flag of Casamance.svg|thumb|left|The [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance|MFDC]] and other separatist groups originally used this horizontal white-green-red tricolor as [[Casamance]]'s national flag{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=396}} ]]\n\nThe discovery of oil in the region emboldened the MFDC to organise mass demonstrations for immediate independence in 1990, which were brutally suppressed by the Senegalese military. This pushed the MFDC into armed rebellion. The following fighting was vicious, and 30,000 civilians were displaced by 1994. Several [[ceasefire]]s were agreed during the 1990s, but none lasted, often also due to splits within the MFDC along ethnic lines and between those ready negotiate and those who refused to lay down their weapons. In 1992 the MFDC divided into two main groups, Front Sud and Front Nord. Whereas Front Sud was dominated by Jola and called for full independence, Front Nord included both Jola as well as non-Jola tribesmen and was ready to work with the government based on a failed agreement of 1991.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=399, 400}} Another ceasefire in 1993 led to the break-off of hardline rebel groups from the MFDC. These continued to attack the military.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}}\n\nThe Senegalese military relocated thousands of soldiers from the northern provinces to Casamance in 1995 in an attempt to finally crush the uprising. The northern soldiers often mistreated the local population and did not differentiate between those who supported the rebels and government loyalists. By this time, the rebels had established bases in [[Guinea-Bissau]], reportedly being supplied with arms by Bissau-Guinean [[Military of Guinea-Bissau|military commander]] [[Ansumane Man\u00e9]]. Man\u00e9's alleged support for the separatists was one factor which led to the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] that erupted in 1998. When Senegal decided to send its military into Guinea-Bissau to fight for the local government against Man\u00e9's forces, the latter and the MFDC formed a full alliance. The two rebel movements started to fight side by side in both Senegal as well as Guinea-Bissau.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}} Although the Senegal-supported government of Guinea-Bissau collapsed, the following MFDC-sympathetic regime was also overthrown in May 1999.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=400, 401}}\n\nIn an renewed offensive against the separatists between April and June 1999, the Senegalese military shelled Casamance's ''de facto'' capital [[Ziguinchor]] for the first time, causing numerous civilian casualties and the displacement of 20,000 people along the Senegal\u2013Guinea-Bissau border. From then on, fighting mostly took place in the eastern [[Kolda Region]]. Another attempt at peace talks started in December 1999, with Senegalese and MFDC representatives meeting in [[Banjul]]. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=401}}\n\n===2000s===\nPeace talks resumed in January 2000, with both sides attempting to end the military conflict and aiming at restoring political and economic normality to Casamance. Discussions were held about the MFDC transforming into a political party, but the talks were hindered by the MFDC's factionalism, and the refusal of the Senegalese government to even consider Casamance's independence.
