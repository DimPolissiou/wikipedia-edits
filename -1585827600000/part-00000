The methods of pluton emplacement are not yet fully understood, but there are many different proposed pluton emplacement mechanisms. Stoping, [[diapir]]ism and ballooning are the widely accepted mechanisms. There is now evidence of incremental emplacement of plutons.\n\n==Stoping==\n{{Main|Stoping (geology)}}\n\nVertical migration of magma is driven by gravity. Stoping occurs when blocks of wall rock material are transferred downward through a [[pluton]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Reginald A.|date=1903|title=The Mechanics of Igneous Intrusion|url=|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=Vol. 15.

Other characteristics of stoping include the presence of xenoliths in the plutons, evidence for the rotation of xenoliths and geochemical evidence of magma contamination.<ref name=\"multiple\" />\n\n===Structural relations around stoped blocks===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nIgneous minerals within a pluton can record deformation history. Therefore, it is useful to understand magmatic fabrics for understanding pluton emplacement.  Experimental work done on rocks has helped with establishing a relationship between the rheology and deformation mechanisms on magma. The setbacks encountered are foliation and lineation can be produced by a number of different processes, magmatic strains can be decoupled from the host rocks, and strains and timing the exact time of fabric formation with a particular pluton ascent mechanism is difficult.  [[Magmatic foliations]] and mafic enclaves usually indicate radially increasing strains normal to the pluton contact and extensional strains parallel to it.\n\nMagmatic fabrics will not record information of the stoping process as they are only formed near the end of the pluton emplacement. Furthermore, any magmatic fabrics that are recorded are likely to be affected by strain. Therefore, the causes of the magmatic fabrics may not be discernable, and at best can only give inferences to the mechanisms for emplacement of the pluton, or magma chamber internal mechanisms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=T. Kenneth|date=1997|title=Timing and the nature of magmatic fabrics from structural relations around stoped blocks|url=|journal=Journal of Structural Geology|volume=Vol. 19. No. 2.|pages=209\u2013224|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Problems with stoping as an emplacement process===\nIn order for a magma body of a certain volume (V) to ascend by stoping by a distance equal to its height (H), a volume of wall rocks equivalent to its volume (V) must sink through the magma. For that reason, for stoping to be an important magma ascent process, plutons should contain large volumes of xenoliths; The floors of plutons such as the Lookout Peak pluton, the [[Tinemaha pluton]] and a number of plutons around the world lack an abundance of  xenoliths.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> If stoping is a significant process there should be abundant xenoliths found.\n\nDaly who proposed the theory of stoping argued that it is an efficient process because large blocks can sink rapidly because of the quadratic dependence on sinking velocity.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> Given the size of the blocks sinking, there should be abundant small fragments produced by natural fragmentation, however there is a paucity of small fragments at pluton margins and this is inconsistent with stoping.\n\nAnother drawback of stoping is it cools too rapidly and occurs too slowly for low density crustal rocks.  There is also not a lot of evidence for forceful lateral emplacement with sufficient strain to make room for the ascending pluton.\n\n==Incremental emplacement==\n\nThere is growing evidence that large homogenous plutons grew incrementally, frequently as [[sill (geology)]]. Sheeted intrusions are recognizable worldwide. Evidence suggests that steeply dipping sheets at the margins of some plutons were emplaced sub horizontally and then tilted at the margin of a sagging floor. It is thought that plutons are fed by dikes and have grown by this process. This is evident in [[McDoogle pluton]] in the Sierra Nevada; this pluton is compositionally layered parallel to its contacts and contains numerous thin concordant panels of wall rock.<ref name=\"mult2\">{{cite journal | last1 = Glazner | first1 = A.

The methods of pluton emplacement are not yet fully understood, but there are many different proposed pluton emplacement mechanisms. Stoping, [[diapir]]ism and ballooning are the widely accepted mechanisms. There is now evidence of incremental emplacement of plutons.\n\n==Stoping==\n{{Main|Stoping (geology)}}\n\nVertical migration of magma is driven by gravity. Stoping occurs when blocks of wall rock material are transferred downward through a [[pluton]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Reginald A.|date=1903|title=The Mechanics of Igneous Intrusion|url=|journal=American Journal of Science|volume=Vol. 15. Issue. 88|pages=269\u2013298|via=}}</ref><ref name=\"multiple\" /> Stoping is an important emplacement mechanism in a variety of tectonic settings and has been widely used to explain discordant pluton contacts.<ref name=\"multiple\">Glazner A., F., and Bartley J., M., 2006, Is stoping a volumetrically significant pluton emplacement process? 2006 , GSA Bulletin, v. 118, p. 1185 - 1195</ref> The most common signatures of stoping are sharp discordant contacts between plutons and wall rocks and a lack of ductile deformation of the wall rocks.  Other characteristics of stoping include the presence of xenoliths in the plutons, evidence for the rotation of xenoliths and geochemical evidence of magma contamination.<ref name=\"multiple\" />\n\n===Structural relations around stoped blocks===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}\nIgneous minerals within a pluton can record deformation history. Therefore, it is useful to understand magmatic fabrics for understanding pluton emplacement.  Experimental work done on rocks has helped with establishing a relationship between the rheology and deformation mechanisms on magma. The setbacks encountered are foliation and lineation can be produced by a number of different processes, magmatic strains can be decoupled from the host rocks, and strains and timing the exact time of fabric formation with a particular pluton ascent mechanism is difficult.  [[Magmatic foliations]] and mafic enclaves usually indicate radially increasing strains normal to the pluton contact and extensional strains parallel to it.\n\nMagmatic fabrics will not record information of the stoping process as they are only formed near the end of the pluton emplacement. Furthermore, any magmatic fabrics that are recorded are likely to be affected by strain. Therefore, the causes of the magmatic fabrics may not be discernable, and at best can only give inferences to the mechanisms for emplacement of the pluton, or magma chamber internal mechanisms.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=T. Kenneth|date=1997|title=Timing and the nature of magmatic fabrics from structural relations around stoped blocks|url=|journal=Journal of Structural Geology|volume=Vol. 19. No. 2.|pages=209\u2013224|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Problems with stoping as an emplacement process===\nIn order for a magma body of a certain volume (V) to ascend by stoping by a distance equal to its height (H), a volume of wall rocks equivalent to its volume (V) must sink through the magma. For that reason, for stoping to be an important magma ascent process, plutons should contain large volumes of xenoliths; The floors of plutons such as the Lookout Peak pluton, the [[Tinemaha pluton]] and a number of plutons around the world lack an abundance of  xenoliths.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> If stoping is a significant process there should be abundant xenoliths found.\n\nDaly who proposed the theory of stoping argued that it is an efficient process because large blocks can sink rapidly because of the quadratic dependence on sinking velocity.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> Given the size of the blocks sinking, there should be abundant small fragments produced by natural fragmentation, however there is a paucity of small fragments at pluton margins and this is inconsistent with stoping.\n\nAnother drawback of stoping is it cools too rapidly and occurs too slowly for low density crustal rocks.  There is also not a lot of evidence for forceful lateral emplacement with sufficient strain to make room for the ascending pluton.\n\n==Incremental emplacement==\n\nThere is growing evidence that large homogenous plutons grew incrementally, frequently as [[sill (geology)]]. Sheeted intrusions are recognizable worldwide. Evidence suggests that steeply dipping sheets at the margins of some plutons were emplaced sub horizontally and then tilted at the margin of a sagging floor. It is thought that plutons are fed by dikes and have grown by this process. This is evident in [[McDoogle pluton]] in the Sierra Nevada; this pluton is compositionally layered parallel to its contacts and contains numerous thin concordant panels of wall rock.<ref name=\"mult2\">Glazner  A. F., Bartley J., M., Coleman S., 2004, Are plutons assembled over millions of years by amalgamation from small magma chambers? , GSA Today, v. 14, p. 114 - 121</ref> Ascent by stoping is less feasible with incremental emplacement because if the active magma body is below the top of a pluton, stoping rearranges material within the pluton and produces no overall ascent. To reach a position at the top of the older increments, an increment would have to stop its way upward through all previous increments.<ref name=\"multiple\" /> The rheology of host rock plays a key role: hard rock will be able to stop magma ascent <ref>Kavanagh,  J.

It was also banned by some British radio stations.\n\n==Background==\nThe song had initially been presented to [[The Byrds]] as a [[Bob Dylan|Dylanesque]] potential single, but they rejected it. [[The Turtles]], another L.A. group which often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as a track on their 1965 debut album ''[[It Ain't Me Babe (album)|It Ain't Me Babe]]'', shortly before McGuire's version was cut; it was eventually released as a single and hit #100 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1970.\n\n==Lyrical references==\n* \"You\u2019re old enough to kill, but not for votin'\" refers to the United States law requiring registration for the draft at age 18, while the minimum voting age (in all but four states) was 21, until [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|a Constitutional amendment]] changed it to 18 in July, 1971.\n* \"And even the [[Jordan River]] has bodies floatin'\" refers to [[War over Water (Jordan river)|The War over Water]].\n* \"If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away.\" Refers to the threat of a nuclear war at any moment, and the damage that this would cause.\n* The song's mention of [[Selma, Alabama]] pertains to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]]\" in March 1965. (The Jan and Dean version substitutes \"[[Watts, California]]\" in the lyrics, in apparent reference to the [[Watts riots]].)\n* \"You may leave here for four days in space, but when you return it's the same old place\" refers to the June 1965 mission of [[Gemini 4]], which lasted just over four days.\n* The lyric \"The pounding of the drums, the pride and disgrace\" refers to the November 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] and [[State funeral of John F.

The following Monday morning he got a phone call from the record company at 7:00 am, telling him to turn on the radio \u2014 his song was playing.<ref>McGuire stated this on ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', Australian ABC TV shown on March 12, 2008.</ref> McGuire's single hit #1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1965.\n\nAfter becoming a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], McGuire re-recorded \"Eve of Destruction\" as the lead track on his second [[contemporary Christian]] release: \"Lighten Up\". He updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line about the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] replaced by the words \"[[Columbine, Colorado]]\", referring to the student massacre of 1999. \n\nOn March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', performing an updated version of \"Eve of Destruction\", with new lines such as \"You're old enough to kill/you just started voting\" and \"...{{nbsp}}can live for ten years in space\".

It was also banned by some British radio stations.\n\n==Background==\nThe song had initially been presented to [[The Byrds]] as a [[Bob Dylan|Dylanesque]] potential single, but they rejected it. [[The Turtles]], another L.A. group which often recorded The Byrds' discarded or rejected material, recorded a version instead. Their version was issued as a track on their 1965 debut album ''[[It Ain't Me Babe (album)|It Ain't Me Babe]]'', shortly before McGuire's version was cut; it was eventually released as a single and hit #100 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1970.\n\n==Lyrical references==\n* \"You\u2019re old enough to kill, but not for votin'\" refers to the United States law requiring registration for the draft at age 18, while the minimum voting age (in all but four states) was 21, until [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|a Constitutional amendment]] changed it to 18 in July, 1971.\n* \"And even the [[Jordan River]] has bodies floatin'\" refers to [[War over Water (Jordan river)|The War over Water]].\n* \"If the button is pushed, there's no runnin' away.\" Refers to the threat of a nuclear war at any moment, and the damage that this would cause.\n* The song's mention of [[Selma, Alabama]] pertains to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and \"[[Selma to Montgomery marches|Bloody Sunday]]\" in March 1965. (The Jan and Dean version substitutes \"[[Watts, California]]\" in the lyrics, in apparent reference to the [[Watts riots]].)\n* \"You may leave here for four days in space, but when you return it's the same old place\" refers to the June 1965 mission of [[Gemini 4]], which lasted just over four days.\n* The lyric \"The pounding of the drums, the pride and disgrace\" refers to the November 1963 [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] and [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|his funeral]], which featured muffled drumming as the casket was slowly taken to [[Arlington National Cemetery]].<ref name=\"sloan\" />\n* The song is referenced in the July 19, 1991 strip for ''[[Big Nate]]''.\n\n== Barry McGuire version ==\nMcGuire's recording was made between July 12 and July 15, 1965, and released by [[Dunhill Records]]. The accompanying musicians were top-tier [[Los Angeles]] [[session player]]s: P. F. Sloan on [[guitar]], [[Hal Blaine]] (of [[Phil Spector]]'s [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|Wrecking Crew]]) on [[Drum kit|drums]], and [[Larry Knechtel]] on [[bass guitar]]. The vocal track was thrown on as a rough mix and was not intended to be the final version, but a copy of the recording \"leaked\" out to a [[disc jockey]], who began playing it.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.xanga.com/barrymcguire/364332725/item.html\n|date=October 9, 2005\n|title=Eve of Destruction\n|first=Barry |last=McGuire\n|website=Barry McGuire.com\n|url-status=dead |archive-date=June 24, 2006\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624103041/http://www.xanga.com/barrymcguire/364332725/item.html\n}}</ref> The song was an instant hit, and as a result, the more polished vocal track that was at first envisioned was never recorded.\n\nMcGuire recalled in later years that \"Eve of Destruction\" had been recorded in one take on a Thursday morning, reading lyrics scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. The following Monday morning he got a phone call from the record company at 7:00 am, telling him to turn on the radio \u2014 his song was playing.<ref>McGuire stated this on ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', Australian ABC TV shown on March 12, 2008.</ref> McGuire's single hit #1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in September 1965.\n\nAfter becoming a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]], McGuire re-recorded \"Eve of Destruction\" as the lead track on his second [[contemporary Christian]] release: \"Lighten Up\". He updated the lyrics when he performed at a reunion of folksingers, with the line about the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] replaced by the words \"[[Columbine, Colorado]]\", referring to the student massacre of 1999. \n\nOn March 12, 2008, McGuire appeared on the Australian music comedy/game show ''[[Spicks and Specks (TV series)|Spicks and Specks]]'', performing an updated version of \"Eve of Destruction\", with new lines such as \"You're old enough to kill/you just started voting\" and \"...{{nbsp}}can live for ten years in space\". The reference to \"[[China|Red China]]\" was also removed, and in its place were the more generic \"Now think of all the hate, still living inside us/it's never too late, to let love guide us\".{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Reception===\nIn the first week of its release, the single was at #103 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] charts. By August 12 Dunhill released the LP, ''[[Eve of Destruction (Barry McGuire album)|Eve of Destruction]]''. It reached its peak of #37 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during the week ending September 25. That same day the single went to #1 on the chart, and repeated the feat on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' chart, where it had debuted at #30.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barrymcguire.com/?page=bio4 |title=Eve of Destruction |publisher=BarryMcGuire.com |author=Barry McGuire |accessdate=5 September 2010}}</ref> McGuire would never again break into the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Avoriaz as a resort is the brainchild of Gerard Bremont, the son of a leading French industrialist whom Jean Vuarnet asked to invest in the project. Gerard Bremont - at the time a notable member of the French jetset - engaged 3 newly educated and highly talented young architects to design the resort and within a few years Avoriaz and especially the Hotel Dromont and its restaurant and Discoth\u00e8que was proclaimed the \"Saint Tropez de Neige\" - the centre of jet-set skiing. At a later stage other former elite skiers such as [[Isabelle Mir]] and [[Annie Famose]] got involved - the latter today running the famous ski-kindergarten. The two of them jointly giving name to one of the leading ski- and fashion shops, The Mirfamose. Today Avoriaz is no longer a Fashionable destination as such but more of a mainstream winter-resort with predominantly self-catering guests staying under more modest conditions. For the Winter 2011/12 ski season Avoriaz has undergone many changes including the development of a brand new area with 8 buildings housing a total of 450 ski apartments including L'Amara, Crozats and L'Electra residences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skicollection.co.uk/Ski/Avoriaz.htm|title=Avoriaz Ski Holidays {{!}} Ski Apartments Avoriaz {{!}} Ski Collection|website=www.skicollection.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403014155/http://www.skicollection.co.uk/Ski/Avoriaz.htm|archive-date=2016-04-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Surrounding pistes==\n\nAvoriaz is a station on the main circuit of one of the largest skiing areas in the world, Les [[Portes du Soleil]], named after a pass between France and Switzerland. The Avoriaz part of the skiing area consists of about 130&nbsp;km of piste. The entire Portes du Soleil offers between 650 and 700&nbsp;km of piste - nearly all of it linked by more than 200 lifts. The total lift capacity is close to 250.000 persons/h. making it one of the two largest linked lift networks in the world alongside [[Les Trois Vall\u00e9es]] (PdS having slightly more lifts but with slightly less capacity/h). Avoriaz is directly linked to Swiss resort Les Crosets and French resorts Chatel and Morzine. The connection between Avoriaz, and specifically the Lindaret bowl and Chatel has recently been upgraded to a 6-man chair, replacing an old chair and opening up the connection for more skiers and snowboarders. Plans are underway to increase the connections between Morzine and Avoriaz, with the new Prodain lift opened at the end of the 2012/13 season and an extension down the valley into the centre of Morzine planned.<ref>http://www.mountago.com/blog/new-prodain-lift{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe Avoriaz-pistes are divided in 4 sectors: The Lindaret, Haut-Forts, Fornet and Super Morzine. The latter being mainly connection to Morzine and heavily used by ski-schools and beginners. \n'''The Lindaret''' is a beautiful valley with a number of red and blue runs plus a single black. In the Lindaret-valley one finds The Stash<ref>The Stash HP: http://www.thestash.com/</ref> - a conceptual snowpark developed by Burton and based on ecological principles. It is the only one of its kind in France. There are a number of restaurants and a small village at the bottom of the valley. \n'''The Fornet area''' is a large bowl with basically skiing everywhere between huge rocks and crevasses. From one of the ridges around the Fornet bowl one can test the famous [[La Chavanette]] - also known as The Swiss Wall, one of the steepest pistes in Europe - it is not part of the Avoriaz-system but belongs to neighbouring Swiss resort [[Les Crosets]].  \n'''Haut-Forts''' is the most demanding area with a number of black runs starting at 2.400 and ending at 1.100 metres, some of which are for experts only. The world cup piste - although rated black - is pretty easy though. This area is also ideal for off-piste although caution is advised since this is an area with frequent avalanches. From the Haut-Forts top-station it is possible to ski directly back to Avoriaz by red or blue slopes.\n\n==Architecture==\nAvoriaz is unique amongst the 1960s purpose built ski resorts. Gerard Bremont hired young architects Jacques Labro, Jean-Jacques Orzoni and Jean-Marc Roques to design the resort.<ref>HP with historic brief: http://www.viamichelin.co.uk/web/Datasheet/d1e2368a31c051672f144261cb48e47e/125195{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> And loosely inspired by some of the ideas of famous Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] they went on to design a resort the like of which had never been seen - high rise buildings (12- 16 floors) with acute angles and a close similarity to the mountains that surrounded them - the result being that seen from afar Avoriaz blends in very well with the mountains. The Dromonts hotel was designed by Labro and was the first building finished in March 1966. The buildings are almost entirely covered in red cedar wood. The 3 original architects of Avoriaz have all won awards for their work such as the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts]], the Equerre d'Argent and silver medal from the Architectural Acad\u00e9mie.\n\n== Downhill mountain biking ==\n\nPortes du Soleil is among the top [[downhill mountain biking]] stations in Europe and by far the largest in France. Several of the more testing routes embark from Avoriaz, and the local branch of the French Ski-School (ESF), change into a downhill biking school and bike rental centre each year during July and August. A number of chairlifts operate during the summer to ensure lift capacity for the rapidly rising number of downhill mountain bikers. The biking of Avoriaz is concentrated in the Lindaret Valley with connections further on towards [[Ch\u00e2tel, Haute-Savoie|Ch\u00e2tel]] and Les Crosets. There is a large number of tracks around Morzine and [[Les Gets]] as well.\n\n== Aquariaz ==\nThis water park with over 1500 tropical plants and 183 tropical trees opened in July 2012, offering an aqua leisure experience in tropical surroundings.\n\n[[File:Aquariaz.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Aquariaz]]\n\n== Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival ==\n\nFor 20 years from 1973 until 1993 Avoriaz was the host of \"Festival international du film fantastique d'Avoriaz\" - a film festival mainly devoted to science fiction and horror movies.<ref>Overview of the winners of the festival: https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Avoriaz_Fantastic_Film_Festival/</ref> [[Steven Spielberg]]'s debut, ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'', was the first prizewinner of the festival. Other winners include [[Peter Jackson]], [[David Cronenberg]] and [[David Lynch]] (twice). There is a quite interesting series of posters covering the 20 festivals. The posters were originally for sale in different sizes, including postcards, but are hard to find today. The posters are on permanent display at the restaurant \"Le Bistro\" in the resort-centre.\n\nThe event was succeeded by the similar [[Festival international du film fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer|Festival International du Film Fantastique de G\u00e9rardmer]].\n\n== Tour de France ==\n\nAvoriaz and its \"mothertown\" Morzine have been frequent hosts to the [[Tour de France]]. Avoriaz has hosted a stage finish of the Tour de France 6 times.<ref>Historic overview of Tour-stages: http://www.letour.com/2009/TDF/COURSE/docs/histo2009_07.pdf/{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> First time was in 1975 with Spanish Vicente L\u00f3pez Carril the winner.

In 2010 Avoriaz was once again host of a Tour de France finish - the first mountainstage of the race won by [[Andy Schleck]]. Furthermore, Morzine in the valley below Avoriaz has hosted stage finishes on a number of occasions. Among others the now infamous stagewin of American [[Floyd Landis]] in 2006 following which he was tested for and convicted of use of doping.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of highest paved roads in Europe]]\n* [[List of mountain passes#Europe|List of mountain passes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Avoriaz}}\n*[http://www.avoriaz.com/ Official tourist information site]\n*[https://avoriaz.virtualtour.poppr.be/ Official Virtual Tour of Avoriaz]\n*[http://www.cycling-challenge.com/2010-tour-de-france-stage-8-preview-with-video/ 2010 Tour de France preview for Stage 8 at Avoriaz]\n\n{{coord|46|11|27|N|6|46|30|E|display=title|source:dewiki}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Ski stations in France]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Haute-Savoie]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ski area\n|name= Avoriaz\n|logo= \n|picture= Avoriaz France winter december 2008.jpg\n|caption=  Avoriaz Resort\n|location= [[France]]\n|nearest_city= [[Geneva]], Switzerland\n|coordinates = {{coord|46|11|27|N|6|46|30|E|type:landmark_scale:50000|display=inline}}\n|top_elevation=  2466&nbsp;m\n|base_elevation= 1100&nbsp;m\n|skiable_area= 130&nbsp;km (Avoriaz) 650&nbsp;km (Portes du Soleil)\n|number_trails= 51 (Avoriaz) 283 (Portes du Soleil)\n|longest_run= 6&nbsp;km\n|liftsystem=  34 (Avoriaz) 219 (Portes du Soleil)\n|terrainparks= 4\n|snowfall= 8&nbsp;m\n|snowmaking=  200 cannons\n|external_link=http://www.avoriaz.com Ski Area Grand Avoriaz\n|}}\n\n'''Avoriaz''' (<small>French and</small> {{IPA-frp|\u02c8avo\u0281ja}} or {{IPA-frp|\u02c8avo\u0281i|}})<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://arpitania.forumactif.com/l-euroregion-arpitanie-f1/prononciation-du-nom-des-villages-de-montagne-t1359.htm|title=PRONONCIATION du nom des villages de montagne|work=arpitania.forumactif.com|access-date=2017-05-17|language=fr}}</ref> is a [[France|French]] [[mountain resort]] in the heart of the [[Portes du Soleil]].

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west. The theory was undermined in the early 20th century by the discovery of [[Hittite language|Hittite]], a centum language in a relatively eastern location, and Tocharian, which was a centum language despite being the easternmost branch. The result was a new hypothesis, following the [[wave model]] of [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]], suggesting that the satem isogloss represents a linguistic innovation in the central part of the Proto-Indo-European home range, and the centum languages along the eastern and the western peripheries did not undergo that change.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nMost scholars reject [[Walter Bruno Henning]]'s proposed link to [[Gutian language|Gutian]], a language spoken on the [[Iranian plateau]] in the 22nd century BC and known only from personal names.{{sfnp|Mallory|Mair|2000|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\nTocharian probably died out after 840 when the [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], expelled from Mongolia by the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], moved into the Tarim Basin.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> The theory is supported by the discovery of translations of Tocharian texts into Uyghur.\n\nSome modern [[Chinese language|Chinese]] words may ultimately derive from a Tocharian or related source, eg.

Samples of the language have been discovered at sites in [[Kucha]] and [[Karasahr]], including many mural inscriptions.\n\nMost of attested Tocharian was written in the [[Tocharian alphabet]], a derivative of the [[Br\u0101hm\u012b script|Brahmi]] alphabetic syllabary ([[abugida]]) also referred to as North Turkestan Brahmi or slanting Brahmi.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M. Peyrot, ''Variation and Change in Tocharian B'', Amsterdam and New York, 2008</ref> The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha.

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood. In 1938, [[George Sherman Lane|George S. Lane]] remarked of Tocharian that \"the vocalism so far has defied almost every attempt that has been made to bring it to order\",<ref>Lane, George S. \"Problems of Tocharian Phonology\". ''Language'', Vol. 14, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1938), pp. 20\u201338.</ref> and as late as 1945 still asserted: \"That the subject [of palatalization] is a confused and difficult one is generally recognized\u2014but so are most of the problems of Tocharian phonology.\"<ref>Lane, George S. \"The Tocharian Palatalization (I)\". ''Language'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Jan. \u2013 Mar., 1945), pp. 18\u201326.</ref> However, rapid progress towards understanding the evolution of the vocalic system, and with it the phonology as a whole, occurred during the period of approximately 1948\u20131960, beginning with Sieg and Siegling (1949).<ref>Sieg, Emil and Wilhelm Siegling (1949), ''Tocharische Sprachreste'', Sprache B. Heft 1. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht.</ref> By 1960, the system was well-enough understood that Krause and Thomas's seminal work of that year{{sfnp|Krause|Thomas|1960}} is still considered one of the most important Tocharian grammatical handbooks.<ref>Ringe, Donald A, Jr. (1990). Review of ''Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology'' by Douglas Q. Adams. ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990).</ref>\n\nDespite the apparent equivalence between the Tocharian A and B vowel systems, in fact a number of vowels are not cognate between the two varieties, and Proto-Tocharian had a different vowel system from both.  For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome. (A similar situation occurred in the history of [[Proto-Greek]] and [[Proto-Romance]].) Certain sound changes occurred prior to palatalization:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n#Some changes involving PIE dentals; see below.\n#The development of PIE ''iH'' into ''y'' + vowel.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word ''{{IAST|yakwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|yuk}}'' (Toch A) \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos'' is declined as follows:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Grammatical case|Case]]\n! colspan=3|Tocharian B\n! colspan=3|Tocharian A\n|-\n!

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!

It is known from manuscripts dating from the 5th to the 8th century AD, which were found in [[oasis]] cities on the northern edge of the [[Tarim Basin]] (now part of [[Xinjiang]] in northwest China) and the [[Lop Desert]]. The discovery of this language family in the early 20th century contradicted the formerly prevalent idea of an east\u2013west division of the Indo-European language family on the [[Centum and satem languages|centum\u2013satem isogloss]], and prompted reinvigorated study of the family. Identifying the authors with the ''Tokharoi'' people of ancient [[Bactria]] (Tokharistan), early authors called these languages \"Tocharian\". Although this identification is now generally considered mistaken, the name has remained.\n\nThe documents record two closely related languages, called Tocharian A (also ''East Tocharian'', ''Agnean,'' or ''Turfanian'') and Tocharian B (''West Tocharian'' or ''Kuchean''). The subject matter of the texts suggests that Tocharian A was more archaic and used as a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] liturgical language, while Tocharian B was more actively spoken in the entire area from [[Turfan]] in the east to [[Tumshuq]] in the west. A body of loanwords and names found in Prakrit documents from the [[Lop Nur|Lop Nor]] basin have been dubbed Tocharian C (''Kror\u00e4nian''). A claimed find of ten Tocharian C texts written in [[Kharosthi|Kharo\u1e63\u1e6dh\u012b]] script has been discredited.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\" >{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Douglas Q. |title='Tocharian C' Again: The Plot Thickens and the Mystery Deepens |url=https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=44503 |website=Language Log |accessdate=25 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest extant manuscripts in Tocharian B are now dated to the 5th or even late 4th century AD, making Tocharian a language of [[Late Antiquity]] contemporary with [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Classical Armenian]] and [[Primitive Irish]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kim |first1=Ronald I. |editor1-last=Rieken |editor1-first=Elisabeth |title=100 Jahre Entzifferung des Hethitischen.

The areas of the squares are proportional to population.]]\n\nThe existence of the Tocharian languages and alphabet was not even suspected until archaeological exploration of the Tarim basin by [[Aurel Stein]] in the early 20th century brought to light fragments of manuscripts in an unknown language, dating from the 6th to 8th centuries AD.<ref>Deuel, Leo. 1970. ''Testaments of Time'', ch. XXI, pp. 425\u2013455. Baltimore, Pelican Books. Orig. publ.

In the 19th century, it was thought that the division between [[centum\u2013satem isogloss|centum and satem languages]] was a simple west\u2013east division, with centum languages in the west.

Tocharian B, however, is found throughout the range and in both religious and secular texts.  As a result, it has been suggested that Tocharian A was a [[liturgical language]], no longer spoken natively, while Tocharian B was the spoken language of the entire area.<ref name=\"mallory-expedition\"/> On the other hand, it is possible that the lack of a secular corpus in Tocharian A is simply an accident, due to the smaller distribution of the language and the fragmentary preservation of Tocharian texts in general.{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe hypothesized relationship of Tocharian A and B as liturgical and spoken forms, respectively, is sometimes compared with the relationship between Latin and the modern [[Romance languages]], or [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. However, in both of these latter cases the liturgical language is the linguistic ancestor of the spoken language, whereas no such relationship holds between Tocharian A and B.  In fact, from a phonological perspective Tocharian B is significantly more conservative than Tocharian A, and serves as the primary source for reconstructing Proto-Tocharian. Only Tocharian B preserves the following Proto-Tocharian features: stress distinctions, final vowels, diphthongs, and ''o'' vs. ''e'' distinction. In turn, the loss of final vowels in Tocharian A has led to the loss of certain Proto-Tocharian categories still found in Tocharian B, e.g. the vocative case and some of the noun, verb and adjective declensional classes.\n\nIn their declensional and conjugational endings, the two languages innovated in divergent ways, with neither clearly simpler than the other.  For example, both languages show significant innovations in the present active indicative endings but in radically different ways, so that only the second-person singular ending is directly cognate between the two languages, and in most cases neither variant is directly cognate with the corresponding [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) form.  The agglutinative secondary case endings in the two languages likewise stem from different sources, showing parallel development of the secondary case system after the Proto-Tocharian period.  Likewise, some of the verb classes show independent origins, e.g. the class II preterite, which uses reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly from the reduplicated aorist) but long PIE ''\u0113'' in Tocharian B (possibly from the long-vowel perfect found in Latin ''l\u0113g\u012b'', ''f\u0113c\u012b'', etc.).<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\nTocharian B shows an internal chronological development; three linguistic stages have been detected.<ref>M. Peyrot, ''Variation and Change in Tocharian B'', Amsterdam and New York, 2008</ref> The oldest stage is attested only in Kucha.

While a full report of what languages these texts represent is not yet available, their conclusions appear to have discredited Schmidt's Tocharian C claims.<ref name=\"adams-tocharian-c-again\"/>\n\n==Phonology==\n\nPhonetically, Tocharian languages are \"[[Centum and satem languages|centum]]\" Indo-European languages, meaning that they merge the [[palatovelar]] consonants {{PIE|(*\u1e31, *\u01f5, *\u01f5\u02b0)}} of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto Indo-European]] with the plain [[velars]] (*k, *g, *g\u02b0) rather than palatalizing them to affricates or sibilants. Centum languages are mostly found in western and southern Europe ([[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italic languages|Italic]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]]). In that sense, Tocharian (to some extent like the [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Anatolian languages]]) seems to have been an isolate in the \"[[Centum-Satem isogloss|satem]]\" (i.e. [[palatovelar]] to [[sibilant]]) phonetic regions of Indo-European-speaking populations. The discovery of Tocharian contributed to doubts that Proto-Indo-European had originally split into western and eastern branches; today, the centum\u2013satem division is not seen as a real familial division.{{sfnp|Renfrew|1990|p=107}}<ref name=\"baldi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gWY7-DBWPW4C&pg=PA39 [[Philip Baldi|Baldi, Philip]] ''The Foundations of Latin'' (1999), pg 39]</ref>\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

It is clearly phonemic because sequences ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' also exist (from [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] of a former ''\u00e4'' between them).\n\n==Proto-Tocharian==\n\n===Vowels===\nProto-Tocharian shows radical changes in its vowels from [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE). Length distinctions eventually disappeared, but prior to that all pairs of long and short vowels had become distinct in quality, and thus have different outcomes. Many pairs of PIE vowels are distinguished in Tocharian only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of palatalization.  For example, PIE ''o'' and ''\u0113'' both evolved into Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (possibly {{IPAslink|\u025b}}), but PIE ''\u0113'' palatalized the preceding consonant, and left a ''y'' when no consonant preceded, while neither of these occurs with PIE ''o''.\n\nReconstructing the changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian vowels is fraught with difficulty, and as a result there are a large number of disagreements among different researchers.  The basic problems are:\n*Tocharian A and B are relatively sparsely attested.\n*The extensive mergers of PIE stop consonants lead to many ambiguities in the potential etymologies underlying particular Tocharian words.\n*The radical restructuring of the vowel system means that few potential sound changes can be rejected as unreasonable, no matter how unlikely they may look on the surface.\n*A large amount of analogical change has occurred in both the nominal and verbal systems, making it difficult to identify which changes are regular.\n\nHistorically, the evolution of the Tocharian vowels was the last part of the diachronic phonology to be understood.

For example, Tocharian A ''a'' reflects a merger of two Proto-Tocharian vowels that are distinguished in Tocharian B as ''e'' and ''o'', while Tocharian B ''a'' reflects a stress-based variant of either Proto-Tocharian ''\u0101'' or ''\u00e4'', while Tocharian A preserves original ''\u0101'' and ''\u00e4'' regardless of the position of stress.\n\nAs a general rule, Tocharian B reflects the Proto-Tocharian vowel system more faithfully than Tocharian A, which includes a number of changes not found in Tocharian B, e.g. monophthongization of diphthongs, loss of all absolutely final vowels, loss of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and epenthesis of ''\u00e4'' to break up difficult clusters (esp. word-finally) that resulted from vowel losses.\n\nThe following table describes a typical minimal reconstruction of Late Proto-Tocharian, which includes all vowels that are generally accepted by Tocharian scholars:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! &nbsp;\n!

However, Ringe reconstructs three vowels ''*\u00eb, *e, *\u1eb9'' in place of the single vowel ''*e'' in the minimal system.  The primary distinction is between ''*\u00eb'' < PIE ''*o'', which is assumed to be a central rather than a front vowel because it does not trigger palatalization, and ''*e'' < PIE ''*\u0113'', which does trigger palatalization.  Other than palatalization effects, both vowels are reflected identically in both Tocharian A and B, and hence a number of researchers project the merger back to Proto-Tocharian.  However, some umlaut processes are thought to have operated differently on the two vowels, and as a result Ringe (as well as Adams<ref>Douglas Adams, \"Ablaut and Umlaut in the Tocharian Vowel System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 4 (Oct. \u2013 Dec., 1978), pp. 446- 450.</ref> and some other scholars) prefer to distinguish the two in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe's ''*\u1eb9'' vowel, a higher vowel than ''*e'', is fairly rare and appears as ''i'' in Tocharian B but ''e'' in Tocharian A.  This vowel does trigger palatalization, and is thought by Ringe to stem primarily from PIE ''*oy'' and from loanwords.  In general, Ringe's Proto-Tocharian reconstruction reflects an earlier stage than the one described by many researchers.\n\nSome scholars use a different notation from what is given above: e.g. ''\u00e6'' or ''\u00eb'' in place of the ''e'' of the minimal system, ''\u00e5'' or ''\u0254'' in place of the ''o'' of the minimal system, and ''\u01dd'' in place of ''\u00e4''.\n\nThe following table shows the changes from Proto-Indo-European (PIE) to Proto-Tocharian (PToch) and on to Tocharian B (TB) and Tocharian A (TA), using the notation of the \"minimal\" system above:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When following a consonant, that consonant is palatalized; otherwise, a ''y'' appears.  Before PIE ''i'', consonants other than dentals are not necessarily palatalized (researchers differ on what exactly happened); this is indicated as (+).\n#A \u2014 sign indicates no vowel; this results from deletion of ''\u00e4'' in open syllables.\n#Tocharian B reflects Proto-Tocharian central vowels (''\u00e4'', ''\u0101'') differently depending on whether they bore stress or not.  This is indicated in the table above: stressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''a \u0101'' while unstressed ''\u00e4 \u0101'' > ''\u00e4 a'' (i.e. Tocharian B ''a'' reflects either stressed ''\u00e4'' or unstressed ''\u0101'').  An additional complication is that unstressed ''\u00e4'' is deleted in open syllables.  See below.\n\nProto-Tocharian had phonemic stress, although its position varies depending on the researcher. Many researchers project the Tocharian B stress that is recoverable from ''\u0101''~''a'' and ''a''~''\u00e4'' alternations back to Proto-Tocharian. For the most part, this stress does not reflect PIE stress.  Rather, most bisyllabic words have initial stress, and trisyllabic and longer words usually have stress on the second syllable.  A number of multisyllabic words in Tocharian B appear to indicate that more than one syllable was stressed; it is thought that these reflect clitics or affixes that still behaved phonologically as separate words in Proto-Tocharian.  Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> however, prefers to project the PIE stress unchanged into Proto-Tocharian, and assumes that the radically different system seen in Tocharian B evolved within the separate history of that language.\n\nThe outcome of the PIE sequences ''*iH'' and ''*uH'' when not followed by a vowel is disputed.  It is generally agreed that ''*ih\u2082'' became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101''; a similar change occurred in [[Ancient Greek]].  It is also usually accepted that ''*ih\u2083'' likewise became Proto-Tocharian ''*y\u0101'', although it is unclear whether this reflects a direct change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u0101 /ya/'' or a change ''*ih\u2083 > *y\u014d /yo:/ > *y\u0101 /ya/'' (echoing a similar change in Ancient Greek), since PIE ''*\u014d'' is generally thought to have become Proto-Tocharian ''*\u0101'' (which was not a long vowel).  The outcomes of all other sequences are much less clear.  A number of etymologies appear to indicate a parallel change ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'', but some also appear to indicate a change ''*uh\u2082 > *\u016b > *u''. Ringe<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> demonstrates that all the occurrences of ''*w\u0101'' can potentially be explained as due to analogy, and prefers to postulate a general sound change ''*uH > *\u016b > *u'' following the normal outcome of ''*uH'' in other languages, but a number of other researchers (e.g. Krause and Slocum<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>) prefer to see ''*uh\u2082 > *w\u0101'' as the regular sound change.  The outcome of ''*ih\u2081'' is likewise disputed, with Ringe similarly preferring a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *\u012b > i'' while others postulate a regular change ''*ih\u2081 > *ye > *y\u00e4''. As elsewhere, the main difficulty is that, relative to other Indo-European languages, Tocharian is sparsely attested and was subject to a particularly large number of analogical changes.\n\nA number of umlaut processes occurred in the Proto-Tocharian period, which tended to increase the number of rounded vowels.  Vowel rounding also resulted from the influence of nearby labiovelars, although this occurred after the Proto-Tocharian period, with differing results in Tocharian A and B, generally with more rounding in Tocharian A (e.g. PIE ''*g\u02b7\u1e43-'' \"come\" > PToch ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' > Tocharian A ''kum-'' but Tocharian B ''k\u00e4m-'').\n\n===Vowel deletion and insertion===\nTocharian A deletes all Proto-Tocharian final vowels, as well as all instances of Proto-Tocharian ''\u00e4'' in [[open syllable]]s (which appears to include vowels followed by ''Cr'' and ''Cl'' sequences).  When this produces impossible consonant sequences, these are rectified by vocalizing ''w'' and ''y'' into ''u'' and ''i'', if possible; otherwise, an epenthetic ''\u00e4'' is inserted.  Note that most consonant sequences are tolerated word-initially, including unexpected cases like ''rt-'', ''ys-'' and ''lks-''.  Example: PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' (Greek ''erythros'') > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch A *''rtr'' > ''rt\u00e4r''.\n\nTocharian B deletes only unstressed ''\u00e4'' in open syllables, and leaves all other vowels alone.  Hence PIE ''h\u2081rudhros'' > PToch ''r\u00e4\u0301tre'' > Toch B ''ratre''.  If necessary, impossible consonant sequences are rectified as in Tocharian A.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following are the main changes between PIE and Proto-Tocharian:\n*[[Centum]] change: PIE \"palatals\" merge with PIE \"plain velars\".\n*Loss of PIE ''d'' (but not other dentals) in a number of words when not followed by a PIE front vocalic.\n*Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration, resulting in (e.g.) the merger of PIE ''k, g, gh''.\n*Palatalization of all consonants before PIE ''e, \u0113, y'' and sometimes ''i'', producing a number of new phonemes (''c'', ''\u015b'', ''\u1e63'', ''ts'', ''\u00f1'', ''ly'').\n*Loss of final consonants other than ''r'', including total loss of certain final clusters (e.g. ''nts'').\n\nThe extant Tocharian languages appear to reflect essentially the same consonant system as in Proto-Tocharian, except in a couple of cases:\n*A new phoneme ''\u1e45'' {{IPA|/\u014b/}} eventually developed.  This was originally an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'', but became phonemic when vowel losses resulted in instances of ''nk'' and ''\u00f1k'' contrasting with ''\u1e45k'', and occasional loss of ''k'' between consonants resulted in instances of ''\u1e45'' not before ''k''.\n*The Proto-Tocharian labiovelar ''*k\u02b7'' eventually merged with ''k'' in both Tocharian A and B.  However, this clearly post-dated Proto-Tocharian, because the former ''*k\u02b7'' often rounded adjacent vowels prior to its loss, in a way that differed between A and B (e.g. Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7\u00e4m-'' \"come\" > A ''kum-'' but B ''k\u00e4m-''). In addition, according to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-adams\">Donald A. Ringe Jr, \"Review of 'Tocharian Historical Phonology and Morphology' by Douglas Q. Adams\", ''Language'', Vol. 66, No. 2 (Jun., 1990), pp. 400\u2013408.</ref> Proto-Tocharian ''*k\u02b7'' is sometimes retained in Tocharian B when directly preceding a voiceless consonant, particularly in western dialect texts.\n\nUnlike in most ''[[centum]]'' languages, Proto-Tocharian maintained separate outcomes of PIE ''*k\u02b7'' and ''*\u1e31w''.<ref name=\"ringe-adams\"/> The latter is still reflected as ''kw'' in Tocharian B, e.g. ''yakwe'' \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos''.\n\n===Palatalization===\n[[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] was a very important process operating in Proto-Tocharian.  Palatalization appears to have operated very early, prior to almost all of the vowel changes that took place between PIE and Proto-Tocharian. Palatalization occurred before PIE ''e'', ''\u0113'', ''y'' and sometimes ''i''; specifically, PIE ''i'' triggered palatalization of dentals but generally not of velars or labials. (According to Ringe,<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/> lack of palatalization before PIE ''i'' was actually due to early change of ''i'' > ''w\u01dd'' after certain sounds.) Palatalization, or lack thereof, is the only way to distinguish PIE ''e'' and ''i'' in Tocharian, and the primary way of distinguishing certain other pairs of PIE vowels, e.g. ''e'' vs. ''u'' and ''\u0113'' vs. ''o''. Palatalization appeared to have operated in two stages, an earlier one that affected only the sequences ''ty'' and ''dhy'', and a later more general one \u2014 or at least, the result of palatalization of ''t'' and ''dh'' before ''y'' is different from palatalization before ''e, \u0113'' and ''i'', while other consonants do not show such a dual outcome.

Palatalization sometimes produces ''c'', sometimes ''ts'', sometimes ''\u015b'', and in some words when a front vocalic does not follow, PIE ''*d'' (but not other dentals) is lost entirely, e.g. e.g. Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' and Toch B ''ime'' \"thought\" < PToch ''*w'\u00e4im\u00eb'' < PIE ''*weid-mo-''.  Many occurrences of ''c'' and ''ts'' can be explained by the differing effects of a following ''y'' vs. a front vowel (see above), but a number of difficult cases remain.\n\nMost researchers agree that some of the PIE dentals are reflected differently from others \u2014 contrary to the situation with all other PIE stops.  This in turn suggests that some sound changes must have operated on particular dentals, but not others, prior to the general loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration.  There is a large amount of disagreement over what exactly the relevant sound changes were, due to the relatively small number of extant forms involved, the operation of analogy, and disagreement over particular etymologies, including both the PIE roots and ablaut forms involved.  Ringe suggests the following changes, in approximate order:<ref name=\"ringe-proto-tocharian\"/>\n#[[Grassmann's Law]], which triggers the change ''dh > d'' when another aspirated consonant occurs later in a word (and which also operated in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]).\n#The change ''d'' > ''dz'', which occurred after Grassmann's Law if it existed.\n#Loss of contrastive voicing and aspiration (which may have occurred after palatalization).\n#Palatalization.  The new sound ''ts'' palatalizes to ''\u015b''; this explains cases like Toch B ''\u015bak'', Toch A ''\u015b\u00e4k'' \"ten\" < PIE ''*dek\u1e43(t)''.\n#Loss of ''ts'' before consonants.\n\nEven with this explanation, a lot of words don't have the expected outcomes and require appeal to analogy.  For example, the assumption of Grassmann's Law helps to explain only two words, both verbs, in which PIE ''*dh'' shows up as ''ts''; and in both of these words, palatalization to ''\u015b'' might have been expected, because the present-tense forms both begin with PIE ''*dhe-''. Ringe needs to appeal to an analogical depalatalization, based on other forms of the verb with different ablaut patterns in which palatalization was not triggered. This assumption is reasonable, because a lot of other verbs also show analogical depalatalization; but nonetheless, it is rather slender evidence, and it is not surprising that other researchers have proposed different assumptions (e.g. that PToch ''*ts\u00e4-'' is the expected outcome of PIE ''*dhe-'', with no operation of Grassmann's Law).\n\nLikewise, the loss of PIE ''*d'' in Toch AB ''or'' \"wood\" < PIE ''*doru'' is not explainable by these rules, because it is lost before a vowel rather than a consonant.  Ringe again assumes analogy: In this case, the PIE conjugation was nominative ''*doru'', genitive ''*dreus'', and Ringe assumes that the normal loss of ''*d'' in the genitive before ''*r'' was carried over into the nominative. Again, not all researchers accept this. For example, Krause and Slocum, while accepting the remainder of Ringe's sound changes involving PIE ''*d'', suggest instead that loss eventually occurred before Proto-Tocharian rounded vowels and before Proto-Tocharian ''\u00eb'' (from PIE ''o''), as well as before nasals and possibly other consonants.<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n==Morphology==\n\n===Nouns===\nTocharian has completely re-worked the [[declension|nominal declension]] system of Proto-Indo-European.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=92}} The only cases inherited from the proto-language are nominative, genitive, [[accusative case|accusative]], and (in Tocharian B only) vocative; in Tocharian the old accusative is known as the ''oblique'' case. In addition to these primary cases, however, each Tocharian language has six cases formed by the addition of an invariant suffix to the oblique case \u2014 although the set of six cases is not the same in each language, and the suffixes are largely non-cognate. For example, the Tocharian word ''{{IAST|yakwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|yuk}}'' (Toch A) \"horse\" < PIE ''*e\u1e31wos'' is declined as follows:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! rowspan=2|[[Grammatical case|Case]]\n! colspan=3|Tocharian B\n! colspan=3|Tocharian A\n|-\n!

An example is ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45k}}'' (Toch A) \"man\", which belongs to the same declension as above, but has oblique singular ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45ka\u1e43}}'' (Toch A), and corresponding oblique stems ''{{IAST|e\u1e45kwe\u1e43-}}'' (Toch B), ''{{IAST|o\u1e45kn-}}'' (Toch A) for the secondary cases.  This is thought to stem from the generalization of ''n''-stem adjectives as an indication of determinative semantics, seen most prominently in the weak adjective declension in the [[Germanic languages]] (where it cooccurs with definite articles and determiners), but also in Latin and Greek ''n''-stem nouns (especially proper names) formed from adjectives, e.g. Latin ''Cat\u014d'' (genitive ''Cat\u014dnis'') literally \"the sly one\" {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} < ''catus'' \"sly\", Greek ''Pl\u00e1t\u014dn'' literally \"the broad-shouldered one\" < ''plat\u00fas'' \"broad\".<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n\n===Verbs===\nIn contrast, the verb [[grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] system is quite conservative.{{sfnp|Beekes|1995|p=20}} The majority of Proto-Indo-European verbal classes and categories are represented in some manner in Tocharian, although not necessarily with the same function.<ref>Douglas Q. Adams, \"On the Development of the Tocharian Verbal System\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 98, No. 3 (Jul. \u2013 Sep., 1978), pp. 277- 288.</ref> Some examples: athematic and thematic present tenses, including null-, ''-y-'', ''-s\u1e31-'', ''-s-'', ''-n-'' and ''-nH-'' suffixes as well as ''n''-infixes and various laryngeal-ending stems; ''o''-grade and possibly lengthened-grade perfects (although lacking reduplication or augment); sigmatic, reduplicated, thematic and possibly lengthened-grade aorists; optatives; imperatives; and possibly PIE subjunctives.\n\nIn addition, most PIE sets of endings are found in some form in Tocharian (although with significant innovations), including thematic and athematic endings, primary (non-past) and secondary (past) endings, active and mediopassive endings, and perfect endings.  Dual endings are still found, although they are rarely attested and generally restricted to the third person. The mediopassive still reflects the distinction between primary ''-r'' and secondary ''-i'', effaced in most Indo-European languages.  Both root and suffix ablaut is still well-represented, although again with significant innovations.\n\n====Categories====\nTocharian verbs are conjugated in the following categories:<ref name=\"Tocharian Online\"/>\n*Mood: indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative.\n*Tense/aspect (in the indicative only): present, preterite, imperfect.\n*Voice: active, mediopassive, deponent.\n*Person: 1st, 2nd, 3rd.\n*Number: singular, dual, plural.\n*Causation: basic, causative.\n*Non-finite: active participle, mediopassive participle, present gerundive, subjunctive gerundive.\n\n====Classes====\nA given verb belongs to one of a large number of classes, according to its conjugation.  As in [[Sanskrit]], [[Ancient Greek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Latin]], there are independent sets of classes in the indicative present, subjunctive, perfect, imperative, and to a limited extent optative and imperfect, and there is no general correspondence among the different sets of classes, meaning that each verb must be specified using a number of [[principal parts]].\n\n=====Present indicative=====\nThe most complex system is the present indicative, consisting of 12 classes, 8 thematic and 4 athematic, with distinct sets of thematic and athematic endings.  The following classes occur in Tocharian B (some are missing in Tocharian A):\n*I: Athematic without suffix < PIE root athematic.\n*II: Thematic without suffix < PIE root thematic.\n*III: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u00eb-''. Mediopassive only.  Apparently reflecting consistent PIE ''o'' theme rather than the normal alternating ''o/e'' theme.\n*IV: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0254-''. Mediopassive only.  Same PIE origin as previous class, but diverging within Proto-Tocharian.\n*V: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', likely from either PIE verbs ending in a syllabic laryngeal or PIE derived verbs in ''*-eh\u2082-'' (but extended to other verbs).\n*VI: Athematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u0101-'', from PIE verbs in ''*-nH-''.\n*VII: Athematic with infixed nasal, from PIE infixed nasal verbs.\n*VIII: Thematic with suffix ''-s-'', possibly from PIE ''-s\u1e31-''?\n*IX: Thematic with suffix ''-sk-'' < PIE ''-s\u1e31-''.\n*X: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-n\u00e4sk/n\u0101sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VI and IX).\n*XI: Thematic in PToch suffix ''*-s\u00e4sk-'' (evidently a combination of classes VIII and IX).\n*XII: Thematic with PToch suffix ''*-(\u00e4)\u00f1\u00f1-'' < either PIE ''*-n-y-'' (denominative to n-stem nouns) or PIE ''*-nH-y-'' (deverbative from PIE ''*-nH-'' verbs).\n\nPalatalization of the final root consonant occurs in the 2nd singular, 3rd singular, 3rd dual and 2nd plural in thematic classes II and VIII-XII as a result of the original PIE thematic vowel ''e''.\n\n=====Subjunctive=====\nThe subjunctive likewise has 12 classes, denoted i through xii.  Most are conjugated identically to the corresponding indicative classes; indicative and subjunctive are distinguished by the fact that a verb in a given indicative class will usually belong to a different subjunctive class.\n\nIn addition, four subjunctive classes differ from the corresponding indicative classes, two \"special subjunctive\" classes with differing suffixes and two \"varying subjunctive\" classes with root ablaut reflecting the PIE perfect.\n\nSpecial subjunctives:\n*iv: Thematic with suffix ''i'' < PIE ''-y-'', with consistent palatalization of final root consonant.  Tocharian B only, rare.\n*vii: Thematic (''not'' athematic, as in indicative class VII) with suffix ''\u00f1'' < PIE ''-n-'' (palatalized by thematic ''e'', with palatalized variant generalized).\n\nVarying subjunctives:\n*i: Athematic without suffix, with root ablaut reflecting PIE ''o''-grade in active singular, zero-grade elsewhere.  Derived from PIE perfect.\n*v: Identical to class i but with PToch suffix ''*-\u0101-'', originally reflecting laryngeal-final roots but generalized.\n\n=====Preterite=====\nThe preterite has 6 classes:\n*I: The most common class, with a suffix ''\u0101'' < PIE ''\u1e24'' (i.e. roots ending in a laryngeal, although widely extended to other roots).  This class shows root ablaut, with original ''e''-grade (and palatalization of the initial root consonant) in the active singular, contrasting with zero-grade (and no palatalization) elsewhere.\n*II: This class has reduplication in Tocharian A (possibly reflecting the PIE reduplicated aorist).  However, Tocharian B has a vowel reflecting long PIE ''\u0113'', along with palatalization of the initial root consonant.  There is no ablaut in this class.\n*III: This class has a suffix ''s'' in the 3rd singular active and throughout the mediopassive, evidently reflecting the PIE sigmatic aorist.  Root ablaut occurs between active and mediopassive.  A few verbs have palatalization in the active along with ''s'' in the 3rd singular, but no palatalization and no ''s'' in the mediopassive, along with no root ablaut (the vowel reflects PToch ''\u00eb'').  This suggests that, for these verbs in particular, the active originates in the PIE sigmatic aorist (with ''s'' suffix and ''\u0113'' vocalism) while the mediopassive stems from the PIE perfect (with ''o'' vocalism).\n*IV: This class has suffix ''\u1e63\u1e63\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Most verbs in this class are causatives.\n*V: This class has suffix ''\u00f1(\u00f1)\u0101'', with no ablaut.  Only a few verbs belong to this class.\n*VI: This class, which has only two verbs, is derived from the PIE thematic aorist.  As in Greek, this class has different endings from all the others, which partly reflect the PIE secondary endings (as expected for the thematic aorist).\n\nAll except preterite class VI have a common set of endings that stem from the PIE perfect endings, although with significant innovations.\n\n=====Imperative=====\nThe imperative likewise shows 6 classes, with a unique set of endings, found only in the second person, and a prefix beginning with ''p-''.  This prefix usually reflects Proto-Tocharian ''*p\u00e4-'' but unexpected connecting vowels occasionally occur, and the prefix combines with vowel-initial and glide-initial roots in unexpected ways.  The prefix is often compared with the Slavic perfective prefix ''po-'', although the phonology is difficult to explain.\n\nClasses i through v tend to co-occur with preterite classes I through V, although there are many exceptions.  Class vi is not so much a coherent class as an \"irregular\" class with all verbs not fitting in other categories.  The imperative classes tend to share the same suffix as the corresponding preterite (if any), but to have root vocalism that matches the vocalism of a verb's subjunctive.  This includes the root ablaut of subjunctive classes i and v, which tend to co-occur with imperative class i.\n\n=====Optative and imperfect=====\nThe optative and imperfect have related formations. The optative is generally built by adding ''i'' onto the subjunctive stem.  Tocharian B likewise forms the imperfect by adding ''i'' onto the present indicative stem, while Tocharian A has 4 separate imperfect formations: usually ''\u0101'' is added to the subjunctive stem, but occasionally to the indicative stem, and sometimes either ''\u0101'' or ''s'' is added directly onto the root.  The endings differ between the two languages: Tocharian A uses present endings for the optative and preterite endings for the imperfect, while Tocharian B uses the same endings for both, which are a combination of preterite and unique endings (the latter used in the singular active).\n\n====Endings====\nAs suggested by the above discussion, there are a large number of sets of endings.  The present-tense endings come in both thematic and athematic variants, although they are related, with the thematic endings generally reflecting a theme vowel (PIE ''e'' or ''o'') plus the athematic endings.  There are different sets for the preterite classes I through V; preterite class VI; the imperative; and in Tocharian B, in the singular active of the optative and imperfect.  Furthermore, each set of endings comes with both active and mediopassive forms.  The mediopassive forms are quite conservative, directly reflecting the PIE variation between ''-r'' in the present and ''-i'' in the past. (Most other languages with the mediopassive have generalized one of the two.)\n\nThe present-tense endings are almost completely divergent between Tocharian A and B.  The following shows the thematic endings, with their origin:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Thematic present active indicative endings\n! rowspan=2| !! rowspan=2|Original PIE !! colspan=2|Tocharian B !! colspan=2|Tocharian A !! rowspan=2|Notes\n|-\n!

The plants have two linear [[leaves]] and a single small white drooping bell shaped [[flower]] with six petal-like ([[petaloid]]) [[tepals]] in two circles ([[whorl (botany)|whorls]]). The smaller inner petals have green markings.\n\nSnowdrops have been known since the earliest times under various names, but were named ''Galanthus'' in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased, various attempts were made to divide the species into subgroups, usually on the basis of the pattern of the emerging leaves ([[vernation]]). In the era of [[molecular phylogenetics]] this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven molecularly-defined [[clades]] are recognised corresponding to the [[biogeographical]] distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.\n\nMost species flower in winter, before the [[vernal equinox]] (20 or 21 March in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), but some flower in early [[spring (season)|spring]] and late [[autumn]]. Sometimes snowdrops are confused with the two related genera within the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Galantheae]], snowflakes ''[[Leucojum]]'' and ''[[Acis (plant)|Acis]]''.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== General ===\nAll [[species]] of ''Galanthus'' are [[perennial]] [[petaloid]] [[herbaceous]] bulbous (growing from [[bulb]]s) [[monocot]] plants. The [[genus]] is characterised by the presence of two [[leaves]], [[:wikt:pendulous|pendulous]] white [[flowers]] with six free [[perianth]] segments in two [[whorl (botany)|whorls]]. The inner whorl is smaller than the outer whorl and has green markings.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}}\n\n=== Vegetative ===\n\n; Leaves:\nThese are basal, emerging from the bulb initially-enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of [[cataphylls]]. Generally, these are two (sometimes three) in number and linear, strap-shaped, or [[oblanceolate]]. [[Vernation]], the arrangement of the emerging leaves relative to each other, varies among species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate), or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants, one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains at the point where the leaves emerge from the soil{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;1\u20132}} (for illustration, see Stearn{{sfn|Stearn vernation|1992}} and Davis{{sfn|Davis vernation|1999}}). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids, but now has been shown to be [[homoplasious]], and not useful in this regard.\n\nThe [[Scape (botany)|scape]] (flowering stalk) is erect, leafless, [[terete]], or compressed.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n=== Reproductive ===\n\n;[[Inflorescence]] :\nThe scape bears at the top a pair of [[bract]]-like [[spathe]] valves usually fused down one side and joined by a papery membrane, appearing [[Glossary of botanical terms#monophyllous|monophyllous]] (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The flower bears six free [[perianth]] segments ([[tepal]]s) rather than [[petals]], arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|acute]] to more or less [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|obtuse]], [[spathulate]] or oblanceolate to narrowly [[obovate]] or linear, shortly clawed, and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or oblanceolate, somewhat [[:wikt:unguiculate|unguiculate]] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex, or both, that when at the apex, are bridge-shaped over the small [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] (notch) at the tip of each tepal, which are [[emarginate]]. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow, or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.<ref name=Meerow98/>{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Androecium]] :\nThe six [[stamens]] are inserted at the base of the perianth, and are very short (shorter than the inner perianth segments), the anthers basifixed (attached at their base) with filaments much shorter than the anthers and [[dehisce]] (open) by terminal [[stoma|pores]] or short slits.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Gynoecium]], [[Fruit]] and [[Seeds]]:\nThe inferior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is three-celled. The [[style (botany)|style]] is slender and longer than the anthers, the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] are minutely capitate. The ovary ripens into a three-celled [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit. This fruit is fleshy, ellipsoid or almost spherical, opening by three flaps with seeds that are light brown to white and oblong with a small appendage or tail ([[elaiosome]]) containing substances attractive to [[ant]]s, which distribute the seeds.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}<ref name=Dahlgren/>\n\nThe [[chromosome number]] is 2n=24.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;7}}<ref name=Meerow98/>\n\n[[Floral formula]]: <math>\\star\\; P_{3+3} \\; A_{3+3} \\; G_{\\overline{(3)}}</math>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Distribution of the galanthus species.png|thumb|450px|right|Distribution map of ''Galanthus'' species in Europe and Western Asia]]\nThe genus ''Galanthus'' is native to Europe and the Middle East, from the Spanish and French [[Pyrenees]] in the west through to the [[Caucasus]] and [[Iran]] in the east, and south to [[Sicily]], the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Aegean islands|Aegean]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].

In doing so he restored the name ''Galanthus'' and retained their placement under Narcissi, this time as a family (known as ''Ordo'', at that time) and referred to the French vernacular name, ''[[:fr:Perce-neige|Perce-neige]]''{{sfn|Clos|1862|loc=''Perce-neige'' p.&nbsp;658}} (Snow-pierce), based on the plants tendency to push through early spring snow (see [[#Ecology|Ecology]] for illustration)].<ref name=Jussieu/> The modern family of [[Amaryllidaceae]], in which ''Galanthus'' is placed, dates to [[Jaume Saint-Hilaire]] (1805) who replaced Jussieu's Narcissi with ''Amaryllid\u00e9es''.<ref name=Saint-Hilaire/> In 1810 [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Brown]] proposed that a subgroup of Liliaceae be distinguished on the basis of the position of the [[Ovary (botany)|ovaries]] and be referred to as Amaryllideae,<ref name=Brown/> and in 1813, [[de Candolle]] separated them by describing Liliac\u00e9es <small>Juss.</small> and Amaryllid\u00e9es <small>Brown</small> as two quite separate families.<ref name=Candolle/> However, in his comprehensive survey of the [[Flora]] [[Flora of France|of France]] ([[De Candolle system|Flore fran\u00e7aise]], 1805\u20131815) he divided Liliaceae into a series of ''Ordres'', and placed Galanthus into the Narcissi ''Ordre''.<ref name=Candollegal/> This relationship of Galanthus to either liliaceous or amaryllidaceaous taxa (see [[Taxonomy of Liliaceae]]) was to last for another two centuries until the two were formally divided at the end of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Meerow et al|1999}} [[John Lindley|Lindley]] (1830) followed this general pattern, placing ''Galanthus'' and related genera such as ''[[Amaryllis]]'' and ''[[Narcissus (plant)|Narcissus]]'' in his Amaryllideae (which he called The Narcissus Tribe in English).<ref name=Lindley1830/> By 1853, the number of known plants was increasing considerably and he revised his schema in his last work, placing ''Galanthus'' together, and the other two genera in the modern [[Galantheae]] in tribe Amarylleae, order Amaryllidaceae, alliance Narcissales.<ref name=Lindley53Amarylleae/> These three genera have been treated together taxonomically by most authors, on the basis of an inferior ovary.

The leaves, which appear in the spring, have a characteristic white stripe on their upper side; applanate vernation\n** ''G. reginae-olgae'' subsp. ''vernalis'', from Sicily, northern Greece and the southern part of former Yugoslavia, blooms at the end of the winter with developed young leaves and is thus easily confused with ''G. nivalis''.\n\n=== Etymology ===\n\n''Galanthus'' is derived from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] \u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 (''gala''), meaning \"milk\" and \u1f04\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 (''anthos'') meaning \"flower\", alluding to the colour of the flowers. The [[epithet]] ''nivalis'' is derived from the [[Latin]], meaning \"of the snow\".{{sfn|Hyam |Pankhurst |1995}}{{sfn|Hollinger|2016}} The word \"Snowdrop\" may be derived from the [[German language|German]] ''Schneetropfen'' (Snow-drop), the tear drop shaped pearl earrings popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Other, earlier, common names include Candlemas bells, Fair maids of February, and White ladies (see [[#Symbols|Symbols]]).<ref name=Churchgal/>\n\n== Ecology ==\n[[File:Schneeglocken.jpg|thumb|''G. nivalis'' piercing snow cover]]\nSnowdrops are [[hardiness (plants)|hardy]] [[herbaceous]] plants that [[perennate]] by underground [[bulbs]]. They are among the earliest spring bulbs to bloom, although a few forms of ''G. nivalis'' are autumn flowering.<ref name=Dahlgren/>{{sfn|Harland|2016}} In colder climates, they will emerge through snow (see illustration). They naturalise relatively easily forming large drifts. These are often sterile,{{sfn|Davis|1999}} found near human habitation, and also former monastic sites.{{sfn|Harland|2016}} The leaves die back a few weeks after the flowers have faded. ''Galanthus'' plants are relatively vigorous and may spread rapidly by forming bulb [[offset (botany)|offset]]s. They also spread by dispersal of seed, animals disturbing bulbs, and water if disturbed by floods.{{sfn|Harland|2016}}<ref name=Churchgal/>\n\n==Conservation==\n\nSome snowdrop species are threatened in their wild [[habitats]], due to [[habitat destruction]], illegal collecting, and [[climate change]].{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} In most countries collecting bulbs from the wild is now illegal. Under [[CITES]] regulations, international trade in any quantity of ''Galanthus'', whether bulbs, live plants, or even dead ones, is illegal without a CITES permit.{{sfn|CITES|2016}} This applies to hybrids and named cultivars, as well as species. CITES lists all species, but allows a limited trade in wild-collected bulbs of just three species (''G. nivalis'', ''G. elwesii'', and ''G. woronowii'') from Turkey and Georgia (see [[#Horticulture|Horticulture]]).<ref name=Citesexp16/>{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=pp.&nbsp;341\u2013343}} A number of species are on the [[IUCN]] [[Red List]] of threatened species, with the [[conservation status]] being ''G. trojanus'' as [[critically endangered]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/164902/5937668|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> four species [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]], ''G. nivalis'' is [[near threatened]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/162168/5551773|title=The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|website=IUCN Red List of Threatened Species|access-date=2018-10-28}}</ref> and several species show decreasing populations.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} ''G. panjutinii'' is considered [[endangered species|endangered]]. One of its five known sites, at Sochi, was destroyed by preparations for the 2014 Winter Olympics.<ref name=RBGpanj/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n\n''Galanthus'' species and cultivars are extremely popular as symbols of spring and are traded more than any other wild-source ornamental bulb genus. Millions of bulbs are exported annually from Turkey and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}} For instance export quotas for 2016 for ''G. elwesii'' are 7 million for Turkey and 15 million for Georgia. Data for ''G. worononowii'' are 15 million for Georgia. These figures include both wild-taken and artificially propagated bulbs.<ref name=Citesexp16/>\n\n===Snowdrop gardens===\n[[File:Bank Hall Snowdrops Feb 2009.JPG|thumb|right|A snowdrop carpet at [[Bank Hall]], Bretherton, UK in February 2009]]\n{{main|List of snowdrop gardens}}\nCelebrated as a sign of spring, snowdrops may form impressive carpets of white in areas where they are native or have been naturalised.

Also, many hybrids between these and other species exist (more than 500 cultivars are described in Bishop, Davis, and Grimshaw's book, plus lists of many cultivars that have now been lost, and others not seen by the authors). They differ particularly in the size, shape, and markings of the flower, the period of flowering, and other characteristics, mainly of interest to the keen (even fanatical) snowdrop collectors, known as \"[[galanthophile]]s\", who hold meetings where the scarcer cultivars change hands.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;329}} &nbsp;Double-flowered cultivars and forms, such as the extremely common ''Galanthus nivalis'' [[Form (botany)|f.]] ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno', may be less attractive to some people, but they can have greater visual impact in a garden setting.

The plants have two linear [[leaves]] and a single small white drooping bell shaped [[flower]] with six petal-like ([[petaloid]]) [[tepals]] in two circles ([[whorl (botany)|whorls]]). The smaller inner petals have green markings.\n\nSnowdrops have been known since the earliest times under various names, but were named ''Galanthus'' in 1753. As the number of recognised species increased, various attempts were made to divide the species into subgroups, usually on the basis of the pattern of the emerging leaves ([[vernation]]). In the era of [[molecular phylogenetics]] this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven molecularly-defined [[clades]] are recognised corresponding to the [[biogeographical]] distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.\n\nMost species flower in winter, before the [[vernal equinox]] (20 or 21 March in the [[Northern Hemisphere]]), but some flower in early [[spring (season)|spring]] and late [[autumn]]. Sometimes snowdrops are confused with the two related genera within the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Galantheae]], snowflakes ''[[Leucojum]]'' and ''[[Acis (plant)|Acis]]''.\n\n==Description==\n\n=== General ===\nAll [[species]] of ''Galanthus'' are [[perennial]] [[petaloid]] [[herbaceous]] bulbous (growing from [[bulb]]s) [[monocot]] plants. The [[genus]] is characterised by the presence of two [[leaves]], [[:wikt:pendulous|pendulous]] white [[flowers]] with six free [[perianth]] segments in two [[whorl (botany)|whorls]]. The inner whorl is smaller than the outer whorl and has green markings.{{sfn|Ronsted et al|2013}}\n\n=== Vegetative ===\n\n; Leaves:\nThese are basal, emerging from the bulb initially-enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of [[cataphylls]]. Generally, these are two (sometimes three) in number and linear, strap-shaped, or [[oblanceolate]]. [[Vernation]], the arrangement of the emerging leaves relative to each other, varies among species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate), or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within the bud and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants, one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within the bud and generally remains at the point where the leaves emerge from the soil{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;1\u20132}} (for illustration, see Stearn{{sfn|Stearn vernation|1992}} and Davis{{sfn|Davis vernation|1999}}). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids, but now has been shown to be [[homoplasious]], and not useful in this regard.\n\nThe [[Scape (botany)|scape]] (flowering stalk) is erect, leafless, [[terete]], or compressed.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n=== Reproductive ===\n\n;[[Inflorescence]] :\nThe scape bears at the top a pair of [[bract]]-like [[spathe]] valves usually fused down one side and joined by a papery membrane, appearing [[Glossary of botanical terms#monophyllous|monophyllous]] (single). From between them emerges a solitary (rarely two), pendulous, nodding, bell-shaped white flower, held on a slender [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]]. The flower bears six free [[perianth]] segments ([[tepal]]s) rather than [[petals]], arranged in two whorls of three, the outer whorl being larger and more convex than the inner series. The outer tepals are [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|acute]] to more or less [[Glossary of leaf morphology#acute|obtuse]], [[spathulate]] or oblanceolate to narrowly [[obovate]] or linear, shortly clawed, and erect spreading. The inner tepals are much shorter (half to two thirds as long), oblong, spathulate or oblanceolate, somewhat [[:wikt:unguiculate|unguiculate]] (claw like) and tapered to the base and erect. These tepals also bear green markings at the base, apex, or both, that when at the apex, are bridge-shaped over the small [[Sinus (botany)|sinus]] (notch) at the tip of each tepal, which are [[emarginate]]. Occasionally the markings are either green-yellow, yellow, or absent, and the shape and size varies by species.<ref name=Meerow98/>{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Androecium]] :\nThe six [[stamens]] are inserted at the base of the perianth, and are very short (shorter than the inner perianth segments), the anthers basifixed (attached at their base) with filaments much shorter than the anthers and [[dehisce]] (open) by terminal [[stoma|pores]] or short slits.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}\n\n; [[Gynoecium]], [[Fruit]] and [[Seeds]]:\nThe inferior [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is three-celled. The [[style (botany)|style]] is slender and longer than the anthers, the [[stigma (botany)|stigma]] are minutely capitate. The ovary ripens into a three-celled [[capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit. This fruit is fleshy, ellipsoid or almost spherical, opening by three flaps with seeds that are light brown to white and oblong with a small appendage or tail ([[elaiosome]]) containing substances attractive to [[ant]]s, which distribute the seeds.{{sfn|Brickell|2011}}<ref name=Dahlgren/>\n\nThe [[chromosome number]] is 2n=24.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;7}}<ref name=Meerow98/>\n\n[[Floral formula]]: <math>\\star\\; P_{3+3} \\; A_{3+3} \\; G_{\\overline{(3)}}</math>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Distribution of the galanthus species.png|thumb|450px|right|Distribution map of ''Galanthus'' species in Europe and Western Asia]]\nThe genus ''Galanthus'' is native to Europe and the Middle East, from the Spanish and French [[Pyrenees]] in the west through to the [[Caucasus]] and [[Iran]] in the east, and south to [[Sicily]], the [[Peloponnese]], the [[Aegean islands|Aegean]], [[Turkey]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].

[[Colesbourne|Colesbourne Park]] in [[Gloucestershire]] is one of the best known of the English snowdrop gardens, being the home of [[Henry John Elwes]], a collector of Galanthus specimens, and after whom ''Galanthus elwesii'' is named.{{sfn|Colesbourne Park |2011}}{{sfn|Ellis|2010}}\n\n===Cultivars===\n[[File:Snowdrop with six petals.jpg|thumb|Snowdrop with extra tepals (mutation)]]\nNumerous single- and double-flowered [[cultivars]] of ''Galanthus nivalis'' are known, and also of several other ''Galanthus'' species, particularly ''G. plicatus'' and ''G. elwesii''. Also, many hybrids between these and other species exist (more than 500 cultivars are described in Bishop, Davis, and Grimshaw's book, plus lists of many cultivars that have now been lost, and others not seen by the authors). They differ particularly in the size, shape, and markings of the flower, the period of flowering, and other characteristics, mainly of interest to the keen (even fanatical) snowdrop collectors, known as \"[[galanthophile]]s\", who hold meetings where the scarcer cultivars change hands.{{sfn|Bishop et al|2001|loc=p.&nbsp;329}} &nbsp;Double-flowered cultivars and forms, such as the extremely common ''Galanthus nivalis'' [[Form (botany)|f.]] ''pleniflorus'' 'Flore Pleno', may be less attractive to some people, but they can have greater visual impact in a garden setting.

A young orphan girl is sent out during a snow storm by her cruel stepmother to find the spirits of the 12 months of the year, who take pity on her and not only save her from freezing to death, but also make it possible for her to gather the flowers even in winter. The [[The Twelve Months (1956 film)|Soviet traditionally animated film ''The Twelve Months'' (1956)]], [[Lenfilm]] film [[The Twelve Months (1972 film)|''The Twelve Months'' (1972)]] and the anime film [[Twelve Months (1980 film)|''Twelve Months'' (1980)]] (''Sekai meisaku dowa mori wa ikiteiru'' in Japan) are based on this fairy-tale play.\n* \"Snowdrops\" was the nickname that the British people gave during the Second World War to the [[military police]] of the United States Army (who were stationed in the UK preparatory to the invasion of the continent) because they wore a white helmet, gloves, gaiters, and [[Sam Browne belt]] against their olive drab uniforms.\n* In the German fairy tale, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', \"Snowdrop\" is used as an alternate name for the Princess [[Snow White]].  \n* The short story ''The Snowdrop'' by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] follows the fate of a snowdrop from a bulb striving toward the light to a picked flower placed in a book of poetry.\n*  Russian composer Tchaikovsky wrote a series of 12 piano pieces, each one named after a month of the year with a second name suggesting something associated with that month. His \"April\" piece is subnamed \"Snow Drop.\" The Russian climate having a later spring, and winter ending a bit later than in other places.\n\n===Symbols ===\nEarly names refer to the association with the [[religious feast]] of [[Candlemas]] (February 2) the optimum flowering time in which white-robed young women proceeded in the procession associated with the [[Purification of the Virgin|Purification]], an alternative name for the feast day. The [[French language|French]] name of ''Violette de la Chandaleur'' refers to Candlemas, while an [[Italian language|Italian]] name, ''Fiore della purificazone'', refers to purification.

He is the author of different architectural projects, including Guest House and the new building of [[Matenadaran]] in [[Armenia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n== Biography ==\nSince childhood, Meschian has been interested in music and arts; singing songs in languages ranging from [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] to [[English language|English]]. At the age of seven, he started taking violin and piano lessons at the school of music named after A. Spendiaryan. It was during those years when he made his first steps in writing songs and joined the boy's chorus at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin. Even though his stay was short (less than a year) in the chorus, it had a profound influence on his subsequent musical creations.   \nWhile still at school, Meschian wrote some of his early masterpieces including \u201cWhere were you, God?,\u201d  \u201cThe Will,\u201d and \u201cThe Old Man.\u201d In 1965, he first performed his well acclaimed and widely controversial \u201cWhere were you, God?\u201d in the auditorium of number 122 secondary school where he was a student at the time.  In 1966, he got accepted to the department of architecture at the [[National Polytechnic University of Armenia]].\n\nIn 1967, Meschian, along with his friends Levon Melikian and Gregory Nalbandian, founded a rock band which they initially did not give a name. The band was simply referred to as \u201cThe Band of the Department of Architecture.\u201d After giving a series of concerts throughout 1967 and on, the band gained an immense deal of acclaim among the youth. By blending Armenian spiritual music with the thriving rock of the time, the band left a remarkable impression on its listeners and became a true revelation. As a result, the activists at the party Central Committee raised concerns about the band's prolific endeavors. The committee led an anti-Meschian campaign accusing him of anti-Soviet propaganda and calling the band members \u201cNewly Ordained Apostles.\u201d It was, in much part, due to the name calling, that the band was later named \u201cThe apostles.\u201d  \nThe remarkable success of the Apostles was not hindered by anti-Meschian Communist efforts. In the early 1970s, Meschian composed the first Armenian [[rock opera]], \u201cThe Insane Asylum\u201d which vastly contributed to the band's publicity. Thereafter, the band started giving concerts in numerous universities and cities such as [[Gyumri]], [[Moscow]], [[Yerevan]] and [[Tallinn]]. In 1971, Meschian gave an outstanding performance in the USSR festival for young musicians in [[Poland]], where the band was only allowed to participate under the guidance of the Communist Committee Activists. Despite the fact that the Apostles found themselves performing in various republics throughout the [[Soviet Union]], they always remained loyal to performing in their native [[Armenian language|Armenian]].\n\nIn 1972, Meschian successfully graduated from university, but due to the anti-Meschian attitudes infested in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], it took him two years to find a job as an architect. In 1974, Meschian was employed by the Armenian Governmental Project where he participated in the development of [[Zvartnots Airport]] in Yerevan. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, where he made the acquaintance of [[Vazgen I]], the Catholicos of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] who commissioned him to write a requiem dedicated to the martyrs of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. With [[Moushegh Ishkhan]]\u2019s permission, Meschian used some of his verses in writing the requiem. In 1975, Meschian performed his requiem at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and with the support of the [[Catholicos]], he later recorded the masterpiece.\n\nIn the beginning of the next decade, the Apostles, unexpectedly, disappeared from the musical arena. At the time of its existence, the band featured various musicians such as Ashot Adamyan, Gevorg Mangasaryan, Viguen Stepanyan, Gevorg Jangulyan, Movses Muradyan, Ashot Eghikyan, Stanislav Buniatyan, Rostom Ohanyan and Ashot Eghikyan. In 1984, Meschian started his own musical path with his students, Vahan Artsruni and Gourgen Melikyan. In the 1980s, he also got leading roles in two motion pictures. He became a part of the film, The Glowing Fire of the Night, playing the role of [[Michael Nalbandian]]. That was an opportunity for him to have his songs included in the movie. The film gave him basis to do a professional recording in the Melodia Studio of Moscow. The film highlighted three of Meschian\u2019s works, \u201cAncient Land,\u201d \u201cEpitaph\u201d and \u201cResurrection.\u201d The second film he did was \"And, Everything will Recur,\" which came out in 1989, when Meschian had already moved to the United States. In the early 1980s Meschian was the leader of the Armenian Industrial Project Studio of Architecture. At the time, he had supervised the reconstruction of Lazarian Seminary in Moscow (Later the Embassy of the Armenian Republic.) He also laid out the construction of the building of Admission for the Armenian government in Yerevan, the extension building to [[Matenadaran]], the library of Manuscripts whose construction got delayed due to the 1988 earthquake and only resumed in 2007, when Meschain was back in Yerevan.\n\nIn 1989, Meschian, along with his family, moved to Boston, where he finally managed to properly record his songs. In 1990, he started performing in places such as the Armenian Church of Boston, the center of Armenian Relief Fund and The Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1990, he recorded his first album called Catharisis. In addition, he formed a new band called Apostles 90 with Wayne Johnson on the guitar, John Leftwich on the bass and Art Rodrigues on the drums. In 1993, Meschian released yet another album called The Monologue of the Insane Violinist, and gave a series of concerts with Apostles 90 in Pasadena, CA. In 1995, Meschian released two other albums; Wander, which included a couple of songs from the Requiem and Communion which he deems the pinnacle of his musical career. In 1996 he first performed the Communion at the First Church of Nazarene in Pasadena. Later in the same year, his Communion was performed  four days in a row at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet in Yerevan.\n\nIn 2001, Meschian released his hit collection featuring four CDs encompassing \u201cThe monologue of a Crazy Violinist,\u201d \u201cCatharsis\u201d, \u201cCatharsis 2\u201d and \u201cCommunion.\u201d In 2003, he gave a concert at the [[Kodak Theater]] (now Dolby Theatre ) where he presented his new songs, and performed the [[Sayat Nova]] piece. In 2005, after living in the United States for 17 years, Meschian and his wife returned to Armenia. There, he gave a series of concerts which were highly esteemed and appreciated by both the general public and his long term fans who had been loyal to his art since the Soviet times.\n\nIn 2007, the construction of the new section of the [[Mesrop Mashtots]] Institute of Ancient Manuscripts begins under the guidance of the chief architect Arthur Meschian. Meschian worked very hard to finish the project before schedule in 2011. Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Meschian managed to give yet another concert tour in 2009. He performed in Yerevan, Moscow, and Pasadena LA. In 2015, architect Meschian finishes yet another project. This time, he designs and conceives the first newly-built museum of  [[Komitas]]  in Yerevan, Armenia\n\nIn 2011, Arthur Meschian is awarded with the [[Mesrop Mashtots Medal]]. In 2012, Meschian is awarded with the golden medal of the office of public construction in Yerevan, Armenia. In 2013, he is awarded with the national accolade of the Armenian Republic for his Matenataran project. As of now, despite his huge musical success, Meschian is not in a hurry to present his new musical creations.\n\n==Discography==\nIn 1975, Apostles recorded the Requiem album, dedicated to the memory of the [[Armenian Genocide]] victims.

Despite the fact that the Apostles found themselves performing in various republics throughout the [[Soviet Union]], they always remained loyal to performing in their native [[Armenian language|Armenian]].\n\nIn 1972, Meschian successfully graduated from university, but due to the anti-Meschian attitudes infested in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], it took him two years to find a job as an architect. In 1974, Meschian was employed by the Armenian Governmental Project where he participated in the development of [[Zvartnots Airport]] in Yerevan. In 1973, he briefly joined the chorus of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, where he made the acquaintance of [[Vazgen I]], the Catholicos of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] who commissioned him to write a requiem dedicated to the martyrs of the [[Armenian Genocide]]. With [[Moushegh Ishkhan]]\u2019s permission, Meschian used some of his verses in writing the requiem. In 1975, Meschian performed his requiem at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and with the support of the [[Catholicos]], he later recorded the masterpiece.\n\nIn the beginning of the next decade, the Apostles, unexpectedly, disappeared from the musical arena. At the time of its existence, the band featured various musicians such as Ashot Adamyan, Gevorg Mangasaryan, Viguen Stepanyan, Gevorg Jangulyan, Movses Muradyan, Ashot Eghikyan, Stanislav Buniatyan, Rostom Ohanyan and Ashot Eghikyan. In 1984, Meschian started his own musical path with his students, Vahan Artsruni and Gourgen Melikyan. In the 1980s, he also got leading roles in two motion pictures. He became a part of the film, The Glowing Fire of the Night, playing the role of [[Michael Nalbandian]]. That was an opportunity for him to have his songs included in the movie. The film gave him basis to do a professional recording in the Melodia Studio of Moscow. The film highlighted three of Meschian\u2019s works, \u201cAncient Land,\u201d \u201cEpitaph\u201d and \u201cResurrection.\u201d The second film he did was \"And, Everything will Recur,\" which came out in 1989, when Meschian had already moved to the United States. In the early 1980s Meschian was the leader of the Armenian Industrial Project Studio of Architecture. At the time, he had supervised the reconstruction of Lazarian Seminary in Moscow (Later the Embassy of the Armenian Republic.) He also laid out the construction of the building of Admission for the Armenian government in Yerevan, the extension building to [[Matenadaran]], the library of Manuscripts whose construction got delayed due to the 1988 earthquake and only resumed in 2007, when Meschain was back in Yerevan.\n\nIn 1989, Meschian, along with his family, moved to Boston, where he finally managed to properly record his songs. In 1990, he started performing in places such as the Armenian Church of Boston, the center of Armenian Relief Fund and The Wilshire Ebell Theatre. In 1990, he recorded his first album called Catharisis. In addition, he formed a new band called Apostles 90 with Wayne Johnson on the guitar, John Leftwich on the bass and Art Rodrigues on the drums. In 1993, Meschian released yet another album called The Monologue of the Insane Violinist, and gave a series of concerts with Apostles 90 in Pasadena, CA. In 1995, Meschian released two other albums; Wander, which included a couple of songs from the Requiem and Communion which he deems the pinnacle of his musical career. In 1996 he first performed the Communion at the First Church of Nazarene in Pasadena. Later in the same year, his Communion was performed  four days in a row at the National Academic Theater for Opera and Ballet in Yerevan.\n\nIn 2001, Meschian released his hit collection featuring four CDs encompassing \u201cThe monologue of a Crazy Violinist,\u201d \u201cCatharsis\u201d, \u201cCatharsis 2\u201d and \u201cCommunion.\u201d In 2003, he gave a concert at the [[Kodak Theater]] (now Dolby Theatre ) where he presented his new songs, and performed the [[Sayat Nova]] piece. In 2005, after living in the United States for 17 years, Meschian and his wife returned to Armenia. There, he gave a series of concerts which were highly esteemed and appreciated by both the general public and his long term fans who had been loyal to his art since the Soviet times.\n\nIn 2007, the construction of the new section of the [[Mesrop Mashtots]] Institute of Ancient Manuscripts begins under the guidance of the chief architect Arthur Meschian. Meschian worked very hard to finish the project before schedule in 2011. Notwithstanding his busy schedule, Meschian managed to give yet another concert tour in 2009. He performed in Yerevan, Moscow, and Pasadena LA. In 2015, architect Meschian finishes yet another project. This time, he designs and conceives the first newly-built museum of  [[Komitas]]  in Yerevan, Armenia\n\nIn 2011, Arthur Meschian is awarded with the [[Mesrop Mashtots Medal]]. In 2012, Meschian is awarded with the golden medal of the office of public construction in Yerevan, Armenia. In 2013, he is awarded with the national accolade of the Armenian Republic for his Matenataran project. As of now, despite his huge musical success, Meschian is not in a hurry to present his new musical creations.\n\n==Discography==\nIn 1975, Apostles recorded the Requiem album, dedicated to the memory of the [[Armenian Genocide]] victims.
