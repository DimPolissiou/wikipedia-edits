{"title_page": "Voting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Vote}}\n{{Redirect|Voter}}\n\n{{Voting images}}\n\n'''Voting''' is a method for a group, such as a meeting or an [[Constituency|electorate]], in order to make a collective [[decision making|decision]] or express an opinion usually following discussions, debates or [[election campaigns]]. [[Democracy|Democracies]] elect holders of high office by voting.  Residents of a place represented by an elected official are called \"constituents\", and those constituents who cast a [[ballot]] for their chosen candidate are called \"voters\".  There are different systems for collecting votes.\n\nIn smaller organisations, voting can occur in different ways. Formally via ballot to elect others for example within a workplace, to elect members of political associations or to choose roles for others. Informally voting could occur as spoken agreement or as a verbal gesture like a raised hand. Keanu Reeves 2020\n\n== In politics ==\nIn a [[democracy]], a [[government]] is chosen by voting in an [[election]]: a way for an electorate to elect, i.e. choose, among several candidates for rule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/voting|title=Voting - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}</ref> In a [[representative democracy]] ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate appoints its representatives to government.\nIn a [[direct democracy]], ''voting'' is the method by which the electorate directly make decisions, turn [[bill (law)|bill]]s into laws, etc.\n\nA vote is a formal expression of an individual's choice for or against some [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motion]] (for example, a proposed resolution); for or against some [[ballot question]]; or for a certain candidate, selection of candidates, or [[political party]]. Many countries use a [[secret ballot]], a practice to prevent voters from being intimidated and to protect their [[political privacy]].\n\nVoting often takes place at a [[polling station]]; it is voluntary in some countries, [[Compulsory voting|compulsory]] in others, such as Australia.\n\n=== Electoral systems ===\n{{Voting}}\n{{main|Voting system|Election}}\n[[File:Swiss voting material.jpg|thumb|left|In [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]], without need to register, every citizen receives at home the [[ballot papers]] and information brochure for each voting (and can send it by post). Switzerland has a [[direct democracy]] system and votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to [[Bern#Politics|Berne]]'s citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time.]]\nDifferent [[voting system]]s use different types of votes. [[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.  B-voters, unconfident of their candidate's chances, split their votes exactly in half, giving both Candidates A and C 15% each.  C-voters, also logically vote for their candidate.  A is the winner with 55%, C at 45% and B 0%.\n\n'''Election results with negative voting:'''\n\nA-voters again, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A. B-voters again, split exactly in half. Each B-voter decides to vote negatively against their least favorite candidate, with the reasoning that this negative vote allows them to express approval for the two other candidates.  C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]\" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.\n\n=== Voting and information ===\nModern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]\u2013[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.<ref>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ([http://wikisum.com/w/Lupia_and_McCubbins:_The_Democratic_Dilemma Summary])</ref>\n\nStudies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Predicting%20Elections%20from%20politicians%20faces.pdf | title = Predicting Elections from Politicians' Faces | author = Kesten C.

May\u2013June 2016.  10 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Meetings and gatherings==\nWhenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote.

This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present.

[[Plurality voting]] does not require the winner to achieve a vote majority, or more than fifty percent of the total votes cast. In a voting system that uses a single vote per race, when more than two candidates run, the winner may commonly have less than fifty percent of the vote.\n\nA side effect of a single vote per race is [[vote splitting]], which tends to elect candidates that do not support [[centrism]], and tends to produce a [[two-party system]]. An alternative to a single-vote system is [[approval voting]].\n\nTo understand why a single vote per race tends to favor less centric candidates, consider a simple lab experiment where students in a class vote for their favorite marble. If five marbles are assigned names and are placed \"up for election\", and if three of them are green, one is red, and one is blue, then a green marble will rarely win the election. The reason is that the three green marbles will split the votes of those who prefer green. In fact, in this analogy, the only way that a green marble is likely to win is if more than sixty percent of the voters prefer green. If the same percentage of people prefer green as those who prefer red and blue, that is to say if 33 percent of the voters prefer green, 33 percent prefer blue, and 33 percent prefer red, then each green marble will only get eleven percent of the vote, while the red and blue marbles will each get 33 percent, putting the green marbles at a serious disadvantage. If the experiment is repeated with other colors, the color that is in the majority will still rarely win. In other words, from a purely mathematical perspective, a single-vote system tends to favor a winner that is different from the majority. If the experiment is repeated using [[approval voting]], where voters are encouraged to vote for as many candidates as they approve of, then the winner is much more likely to be any one of the five marbles, because people who prefer green will be able to vote for every one of the green marbles.\n\n<!-- Needs attention \u2193 -->\nA development on the 'single vote' system is to have [[Two-round system|two-round]] elections, or repeat [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]]. This system is most common around the world. In most cases, the winner must receive a majority, which is more than half.<ref>[[Majority rule]].</ref>  and if no candidate obtains a majority at the first round, then the two candidates with the largest plurality are selected for the second round. Variants exist on these two points: the requirement for being elected at the first round is sometimes less than 50%, and the rules for participation in the runoff may vary.\n\nAn alternative to the Two-round voting system is the single round [[instant-runoff voting]] system (Also referred to as ''Alternative vote'' or ''[[Ranked voting systems|Preferential voting]]'') as used in some elections in Australia, Ireland and the USA. Voters rank each candidate in order of preference (1,2,3 etc.). Votes are distributed to each candidate according to the preferences allocated. If no single candidate has 50% of the vote, then the candidate with the fewest votes is excluded and their votes redistributed according to the voters nominated order of preference. The process repeating itself until a candidate has 50% or more votes. The system is designed to produce the same result as an [[exhaustive ballot]] but using only a single round of voting.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''multiple vote'', the voter can vote for any subset of the alternatives. So, a voter might vote for Alice, Bob, and Charlie, rejecting Daniel and Emily. [[Approval voting]] uses such multiple votes.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''ranked vote'', the voter has to rank the alternatives in order of preference. For example, they might vote for Bob in first place, then Emily, then Alice, then Daniel, and finally Charlie. [[Ranked voting systems]], such as those famously used in Australia, use a ranked vote.\n\nIn a voting system that uses a ''scored vote'' (or ''range vote''), the voter gives each alternative a number between one and ten (the upper and lower bounds may vary). See [[cardinal voting systems]].\n\nSome \"multiple-winner\" systems may have a single vote or one vote per elector per available position. In such a case the elector could vote for Bob and Charlie on a ballot with two votes. These types of systems can use ranked or [[Plurality-at-large voting|unranked]] voting, and are often used for [[at-large]] positions such as on some city councils.\n\n=== Referendums ===\n\nMost of the time, when the citizens of a country are invited to vote, it is for an [[election]]. However, people can also vote in [[referendum]]s and [[initiative]]s. Since the end of the eighteenth century, more than five hundred national referendums (including initiatives) were organised in the world; among them, more than three hundred were held in [[Voting in Switzerland|Switzerland]].<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Bruno S. Frey et Claudia Frey Marti, ''Le bonheur. L'approche \u00e9conomique'', [[Presses polytechniques et universitaires romandes]], 2013 ({{ISBN|978-2-88915-010-6}}).</ref> [[Australia]] ranked second with dozens of referendums.\n\n=== Fair voting ===\n{{Confusing|date=July 2011}}\nResults may lead at best to confusion, at worst to violence and even [[civil war]], in the case of political rivals. Many alternatives may fall in the latitude of indifference\u2014they are neither accepted nor rejected. Avoiding the choice that most people strongly reject may sometimes be at least as important as choosing the one that they most favour.\n\nThere are [[social choice theory]] definitions of seemingly reasonable criteria that are a measure of the fairness of certain aspects of voting, including [[non-dictatorship]], [[unrestricted domain]], non-imposition, [[Pareto efficiency]], and [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] but [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that no voting system can meet all these standards.\n\nTo ensure fair voting and preventing the misuse of the microblogging platform, [[Twitter]] announced for adding a feature for users to report content that misleads voters. This announcement came when general elections are going to be held in India and some other countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/twitter-adds-feature-for-users-to-report-content-that-misleads-voters/article26933008.ece|title=Twitter adds feature for users to report content that misleads voters|date=2019-04-24|work=thehindubusinessline|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Negative voting ===\n\n{{Main|Disapproval voting}}\n\nNegative voting allows a vote that expresses disapproval of a candidate.  For explanatory purposes, consider a hypothetical voting system that uses negative voting.  In this system, one vote is allowed, with the choice of either  for a candidate, or against a candidate.  Each positive vote adds one to a candidate's overall total, while a negative vote subtracts one, arriving at a net favorability.  The candidate with the highest net favorability is the winner. Note that not only is a negative total possible, but also, a candidate may even be elected with 0 votes if enough negative votes are cast against their opponents.\n\nUnder this implementation, negative voting is no different from a positive voting system, when only two candidates are on the ballot. However, in the case of three or more candidates, each negative vote for a candidate counts positively towards all of the other candidates.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\nThree candidates are running for the same seat.  Two hypothetical election results are given, contrasting positive and negative voting.  Both polling accuracy and voter turnout are assumed to be 100 percent.\n\n<div float=none>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Current standing in the polls\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidate \n! scope=\"col\" | Party\n! scope=\"col\" right | Polling \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| Party 1|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 40%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| Party 2|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| Party 3|| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 30%\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"  \n|+ Election results after positive voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | +55\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | +45\n|}\n{| align=\"left\"\n|+\n|  \n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"left\"\n|+ Election results after negative voting\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Candidates\n! scope=\"col\" | A voters\n! scope=\"col\" | B voters\n! scope=\"col\" | C voters\n! scope=\"col\" | Net total \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | A\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | +40 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -30 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -5\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | B\n| style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;background: lime;\" | 0\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | C\n| style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | -15 || style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0 || style=\"text-align:right;\" |-15\n|}\n</div>\n{{clear}}\n\n'''Election results with positive voting:'''\n\nA-voters, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A.  B-voters, unconfident of their candidate's chances, split their votes exactly in half, giving both Candidates A and C 15% each.  C-voters, also logically vote for their candidate.  A is the winner with 55%, C at 45% and B 0%.\n\n'''Election results with negative voting:'''\n\nA-voters again, with the clear advantage of 40%, logically vote for Candidate A. B-voters again, split exactly in half. Each B-voter decides to vote negatively against their least favorite candidate, with the reasoning that this negative vote allows them to express approval for the two other candidates.  C-voters also decide to vote negatively against Candidate A, reasoning along similar lines.  Candidate B is the winner with 0 votes.  Enough negative votes were cast against Candidate B's opponents, resulting in negative totals.  Candidate A, despite having polled at 40%,  winds up with -5%, offset due to the aggregate 45% of negative votes cast by B and C voters. Candidate C ends up with -15%.\n\n=== Proxy voting ===\n{{Main|Proxy voting}}\nProxy voting is the type of voting where a registered citizen who is able to vote passes on his or her vote to a different voter or electorate legitimately.\n\n=== Anti-voting ===\n{{Main|Abstention}}\n\nIn [[South Africa]], there is a strong presence of anti-voting campaigns by poor citizens. They make the structural argument that no political party truly represents them. For instance, this resulted in the \"[[No Land! No House! No Vote!]]\" Campaign which becomes very prominent each time the country holds elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://libcom.org/library/the-no-land-no-house-no-vote-campaign-still-2009|title=The 'No Land, No House, No Vote' campaign still on for 2009|date=5 May 2005|publisher=[[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://antieviction.org.za/2005/12/12/indymedia-presents-no-land-no-house-no-vote/| title=IndyMedia Presents: No Land!

These include the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] and various [[anarchist]]-oriented movements.\n\nIt is possible to make a [[blank vote]], carrying out the act of voting, which may be compulsory, without selecting any candidate or option, often as an act of protest. In some jurisdictions, there is an official [[none of the above]] option and it is counted as a valid vote. Usually, blank and null votes are counted (together or separately) but are not considered valid.\n\n=== Voting and information ===\nModern political science has questioned whether [[average]] citizens have sufficient political information to cast meaningful votes. A series of studies coming out of the [[University of Michigan]] in the 1950s and 1960s argued that voters lack a basic understanding of current issues, the [[Liberalism|liberal]]\u2013[[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Ideology|ideological]] dimension, and the relative ideological dilemma.<ref>Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ([http://wikisum.com/w/Lupia_and_McCubbins:_The_Democratic_Dilemma Summary])</ref>\n\nStudies from other institutions have suggested that the physical appearance of candidates is a criterion upon which voters base their decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Predicting%20Elections%20from%20politicians%20faces.pdf | title = Predicting Elections from Politicians' Faces | author = Kesten C.

May\u2013June 2016.  10 October 2016.</ref>\n\n==Meetings and gatherings==\nWhenever several people who do not all agree need to make some decision, voting is a very common way of reaching a decision peacefully. The right to vote is usually restricted to certain people. Members of a society or club, or shareholders of a company, but not outsiders, may elect its officers, or adopt or change its rules, in a similar way to the election of people to official positions. A panel of judges, either formal judicial authorities or, say, judges of a competition, may make decisions by voting. A group of friends or members of a family may decide which film to see by voting. The method of voting can range from formal submission of written votes, through [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies#Show of hands|show of hands]], [[voice voting]] or [[audience response]] systems, to informally noting which outcome seems to be preferred by more people.\n\n=== Voting basis ===\n{{See also|Majority|Supermajority|Unanimity}}According to [[Robert's Rules of Order]], a widely used guide to [[parliamentary procedure]], the bases for determining the voting result consist of two elements: (1) the percentage of votes that are required for a proposal to be adopted or for a candidate to be elected (e.g. more than half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc.); and (2) the set of members to which the proportion applies (e.g. the members present and voting, the members present, the entire membership of the organization, the entire electorate, etc.).<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 402|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors=etal|title-link = Robert's Rules of Order}}</ref> An example is a majority vote of the members present and voting.\n\nThe voting result could also be determined using a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], or the most votes among the choices.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = 404\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a decision could be made without a formal vote by using [[unanimous consent]].<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 54}}</ref>\n\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{About-distinguish2|the physical means of casting ballots|details of voting theory, for which see [[Electoral system]]}}\nA '''voting method''' is the way in which people cast their votes in an [[election]] or [[referendum]]. There are several different methods in use around the world.\n\n==Voting methods in deliberative assemblies==\n{{main|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\n[[Deliberative assembly|Deliberative assemblies]]\u2014bodies that use [[parliamentary procedure]] to arrive at [[Decision making|decisions]]\u2014use several methods of voting on [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] (formal proposal by a member or members of a deliberative assembly that the assembly take certain action). The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. The assembly could decide on the voting method by adopting a motion on it. Different legislatures may have their own voting methods.\n\n==Voting methods==\n{{Redirect-distinguish|Voting method|Electoral system}}\n\n===Paper-based methods===\nThe most common voting method uses paper [[ballot]]s on which voters mark their preferences. This may involve marking their support for a candidate or party listed on the ballot, or a [[Write-in candidate|write-in]], where they write out the name of their preferred candidate if it is not listed.\n\n[[Image:Kalpi israel 18.JPG|Ballot letters in Israel|thumb|150px|right]]\nAn alternative paper-based system known as [[ballot letters]] is used in [[Israel]], where polling booths contain a tray with ballots for each party contesting the elections; the ballots are marked with the letter(s) assigned to that party. Voters are given an envelope into which they put the ballot of the party they wish to vote for, before placing the envelope in the [[ballot box]]. The same system is also implemented in [[Latvia]].\n\n===Machine voting===\n{{main|Voting machine|Electronic voting}}\n\nMachine voting uses [[voting machine]]s, which may be manual (e.g. [[Voting machine#Direct-recording voting system|lever machines]]) or [[Electronic voting|electronic]]. In Brazil, voters type in the number of the candidate they wish to vote for and then confirm their vote when the candidate's photo is displayed on screen.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/international/21600162-teaching-those-who-cannot-read-how-vote-makes-cleaner-fairer-elections-making-their Illiterate voters: Making their mark] The Economist, 5 April 2014</ref>\n\n===Online voting===\nIn some countries people are allowed to vote online. Estonia was one of the first countries to use [[Electronic voting in Estonia|online voting]]: it was first used in the [[Estonian municipal elections, 2005|2005 local elections]].<ref>[http://www.vvk.ee/voting-methods-in-estonia/engindex/statistics Voting methods in Estonia: Statistics about Internet Voting in Estonia] VVK</ref>\n\n===Postal voting===\nMany countries allow [[postal voting]], where voters are sent a ballot and return it by post.\n\n===Open ballot===\nIn contrast to a [[secret ballot]], an [[Open ballot system|open ballot]] takes place in public and is commonly done by a show of hands. An example is the [[Landsgemeinde]] system in Switzerland, which is still in use in the [[Swiss canton|cantons]] of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Grisons]], and [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]].\n\n===Other methods===\nIn [[The Gambia]], voting is carried out using marbles, a method introduced in 1965 to deal with [[illiteracy]].<ref name=BBC>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/5369966.stm Gambians vote with their marbles] BBC News, 22 September 2006</ref> Polling stations contain metal drums painted in party colours and emblems with candidates' photos attached to them.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/11/29/gambia-vote-roll-marbles/ Gambia vote a roll of the marbles] The Telegrapgh, 29 November 2016</ref><ref name=BBC/> Voters are given a marble to place in the drum of their chosen candidate; when dropped into the drum, a bell sounds to register the vote. To avoid confusion, bicycles are banned near polling booths on election day.<ref name=BBC/> If the marble is left on top of the drum rather than placed in it, the vote is deemed invalid.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38164870 Gambia election: Voters use marbles to choose president] BBC News, 30 November 2016</ref>\n\nA similar system used in social clubs sees voters given a white ball to indicate support and a black ball to indicate opposition. This led to the coining of the term [[blackballing]].\n\n===In person===\n{{see also|Voting methods in deliberative assemblies}}\nSome votes are carried in person if all the people eligible to vote are present.

When she was five years old, she moved with her parents and sister to Kiryat Tivon, a small town in the Galilee, where she attended the Rimonim Elementary School (1961\u20131969) and the Haim Greenberg High School (1970\u20131974). When she turned 18, she was drafted to the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], where she served as a soldier-teacher in the [[Sde Boker]] Field School, managed by the sculptor Ezra Orion and Shalom Oren. At the age of 24, she married Ehud Shany and had two daughters.<ref>[http://readbooks.co.il/nurit-shany/ Nurit Shany at Read Books], 2012{{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nShany studied at the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] for a [[BFA degree]] (1976\u20131980); in the Jewish Philosophy Department at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], 1981; Art therapy at David Yellin Seminary (1981\u20131984)<ref>[https://museum.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Shani,%20Nurit&list=S Nurit Shani, in [[The Israel Museum]]]</ref>; In addition, she practiced guided imagery with Collet Abulker Muscat and Kathryn de CeGonzak (1986\u20131996), and practiced theatre with the director Nava Zuckerman in Tmuna Theatre (1988\u20131991).<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref><ref>[https://museum.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Shani,%20Nurit&list=S Nurit Shani, in [[The Israel Museum]]]</ref>\n\n\n\nBetween 1997 and 2010 Shany lived in [[Tzur Hadassah]] and created a series of oil paintings titled 'People in the public domain'. In 2004, encouraged by the painter [[Yosl Bergner]], she opened a private studio, in which she created the series of paintings 'Shop windows'. This entire series was purchased by JCS Television Studios in [[Jerusalem]]. Inspired by the events of the [[Intifada]], she created the 'Intifada' series that was presented in 2002 at the Israeli Gallery in New York City. The 'Israeli Summer' series, which includes paintings of the Judean Mountains and the [[Galilee]] landscapes and enlargements of pinecones, wildflowers and almonds in bloom was exhibited in [[Tel Aviv]] in 2010, curated by Nurit Tal-Tenne.<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref>\n\nAlong the same line of her occupation with the visual arts, and as a genuine part of it, Shany established, in 1994 a theatre for children's stories called \"Sipuran\". This theatre was active until 2004, and mostly showed plays based on stories and songs from the [[Yiddish]] heritage and the [[Eastern European]] heritage. The performances were commissioned and funded by Beit Shmuel and the Youth Division of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem. She also appeared as an actress-storyteller for adult shows with her father the writer and storyteller, Yosl Birstien, across the country on behalf of Omanut La'Am organization. At these shows she drew on stage and paintings were bought by the audience throughout Israel.\n\nIn 1997, Shany initiated a community art project called \"Connecting through Art\". This project used artwork produced by teens from New York City and [[Jerusalem]] to decorate public buildings such as the East Talpiot Community Center, the [[Kiryat HaYovel]] Community Center, the Youth Division of the [[Jerusalem Municipality]], the Keshet School, the Alin Hospital, the memorial site in the Katamon, etc. It was funded by the Jewish Agency and the \"Partnership 2000\" \u2013 New York Jerusalem Foundation.<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref><ref>[https://aicf.org/artist/nurit-shany-2/ Nurit Shany, in America-Israel Cultural Foundation Website]</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Shany moved to [[Tel Aviv]] and set up an independent studio where she created a series of oil painting landscapes of 'Tel Aviv seashores'. Her art was bought and auctioned by the Montefiore Gallery to art collectors<ref>[http://archive.montefiore.co.il/auction.php?advSearch=true&search_auction=&search_itemName=&search_artist=%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99 Nurit Shany painting in Montefiore Gallery] {{in lang|he}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Nurit-Shany/445066C4AD898897/Biography Nurit Shany Biography, in MutualArt]</ref> Paintings from this series are in collections such as the Azrieli Collection, Schatz Collection, Shlush collection etc. Over the years, she presents in various exhibitions, in Israel, New York City and Habsburg, and her paintings are sold to Israeli collectors on behalf of galleries and auction houses.

Birstein, Hebrew: '''\u05e0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9'''; born 22 February 1956), is a painter and a multidisciplinary Israeli artist.\n\n==Biography==\n\nNurit Shany, is an Israeli artist, born 22 February 1956 in Kibbutz Gvat, in the [[Jezreel Valley]],<ref>[https://aicf.org/artist/nurit-shany-2/ Nurit Shany, in America-Israel Cultural Foundation Website]</ref> To the author Yossel Birstein and his wife Margaret. When she was five years old, she moved with her parents and sister to Kiryat Tivon, a small town in the Galilee, where she attended the Rimonim Elementary School (1961\u20131969) and the Haim Greenberg High School (1970\u20131974). When she turned 18, she was drafted to the [[Israeli Defense Forces]], where she served as a soldier-teacher in the [[Sde Boker]] Field School, managed by the sculptor Ezra Orion and Shalom Oren. At the age of 24, she married Ehud Shany and had two daughters.<ref>[http://readbooks.co.il/nurit-shany/ Nurit Shany at Read Books], 2012{{in lang|he}}</ref>\n\nShany studied at the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] in [[Jerusalem]] for a [[BFA degree]] (1976\u20131980); in the Jewish Philosophy Department at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], 1981; Art therapy at David Yellin Seminary (1981\u20131984)<ref>[https://museum.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Shani,%20Nurit&list=S Nurit Shani, in [[The Israel Museum]]]</ref>; In addition, she practiced guided imagery with Collet Abulker Muscat and Kathryn de CeGonzak (1986\u20131996), and practiced theatre with the director Nava Zuckerman in Tmuna Theatre (1988\u20131991).<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref><ref>[https://museum.imj.org.il/artcenter/newsite/en/?artist=Shani,%20Nurit&list=S Nurit Shani, in [[The Israel Museum]]]</ref>\n\n\n\nBetween 1997 and 2010 Shany lived in [[Tzur Hadassah]] and created a series of oil paintings titled 'People in the public domain'. In 2004, encouraged by the painter [[Yosl Bergner]], she opened a private studio, in which she created the series of paintings 'Shop windows'. This entire series was purchased by JCS Television Studios in [[Jerusalem]]. Inspired by the events of the [[Intifada]], she created the 'Intifada' series that was presented in 2002 at the Israeli Gallery in New York City. The 'Israeli Summer' series, which includes paintings of the Judean Mountains and the [[Galilee]] landscapes and enlargements of pinecones, wildflowers and almonds in bloom was exhibited in [[Tel Aviv]] in 2010, curated by Nurit Tal-Tenne.<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref>\n\nAlong the same line of her occupation with the visual arts, and as a genuine part of it, Shany established, in 1994 a theatre for children's stories called \"Sipuran\". This theatre was active until 2004, and mostly showed plays based on stories and songs from the [[Yiddish]] heritage and the [[Eastern European]] heritage. The performances were commissioned and funded by Beit Shmuel and the Youth Division of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem. She also appeared as an actress-storyteller for adult shows with her father the writer and storyteller, Yosl Birstien, across the country on behalf of Omanut La'Am organization. At these shows she drew on stage and paintings were bought by the audience throughout Israel.\n\nIn 1997, Shany initiated a community art project called \"Connecting through Art\". This project used artwork produced by teens from New York City and [[Jerusalem]] to decorate public buildings such as the East Talpiot Community Center, the [[Kiryat HaYovel]] Community Center, the Youth Division of the [[Jerusalem Municipality]], the Keshet School, the Alin Hospital, the memorial site in the Katamon, etc. It was funded by the Jewish Agency and the \"Partnership 2000\" \u2013 New York Jerusalem Foundation.<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref><ref>[https://aicf.org/artist/nurit-shany-2/ Nurit Shany, in America-Israel Cultural Foundation Website]</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Shany moved to [[Tel Aviv]] and set up an independent studio where she created a series of oil painting landscapes of 'Tel Aviv seashores'. Her art was bought and auctioned by the Montefiore Gallery to art collectors<ref>[http://archive.montefiore.co.il/auction.php?advSearch=true&search_auction=&search_itemName=&search_artist=%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA+%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99 Nurit Shany painting in Montefiore Gallery] {{in lang|he}}</ref><ref>[https://www.mutualart.com/Artist/Nurit-Shany/445066C4AD898897/Biography Nurit Shany Biography, in MutualArt]</ref> Paintings from this series are in collections such as the Azrieli Collection, Schatz Collection, Shlush collection etc. Over the years, she presents in various exhibitions, in Israel, New York City and Habsburg, and her paintings are sold to Israeli collectors on behalf of galleries and auction houses. Recently, she has been creating a new series of paintings called \"Paradigm Shift\". It generates images of famous worldwide cities in which terror events took place, and can be observed from two points of view, standing straight or upside down. Thus, Shany encourages thought about the humanity, which exists both in a physical and a mental space, composed of multiple realities.<ref>[http://www.artworks.co.il/?p=314 Nurit Shany at Art Works]</ref>\n\nAnother new series of oil painting is \"The Reality Between Its Image and Its Reflection\" in which reflections are windows to imagery in relation to material, reflecting escapism, dream, imagination or fear, in-out, up-down, you-me, relationships.\n\n==Her Art==\nShany paints figurative [[oil-on-canvas]] paintings.<ref>[https://www.artpeoplegallery.com/nurit-shany-art/ Nurit Shany Art, in Artpeople Website]</ref> Her photographic images are taken from the public domain and the Israeli experience.

In response to his controversial but \"justified\" quick-draw shooting of mob [[hitman]] Tommy Bucks in Miami, Givens is reassigned to [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The Eastern District of Kentucky Marshal's Office is based in Lexington, and its jurisdiction includes [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]], where Raylan was raised and which he thought he had escaped for good in his youth.\n\n===Season 1===\n{{Main|Justified (season 1)}}\nThe story arc of season one concentrates on the crimes of the Crowder family. Raylan seeks to protect Ava Crowder ([[Joelle Carter]]) from the rest of the Crowder clan after she shoots her husband, Bowman Crowder, dead in retaliation for years of abuse. Her biggest threat initially comes from Boyd Crowder ([[Walton Goggins]]), a local criminal masquerading as a [[white supremacist]] whom Raylan shoots in a stand-off. Boyd survives the shot to the chest and claims it is a sign from God that he should change his ways. Raylan hesitates to believe him, but Boyd is soon sent to prison, where he spends his time reading the Bible and preaching to convicts. The season builds towards the release of family patriarch Bo ([[M.C. Gainey]]), who wishes to rebuild his family's drug trade and to settle old scores, including one with Raylan's father, Arlo ([[Raymond J. Barry]]), who has cheated him out of money. Bo's release is soon followed by Boyd's, after a technicality prevents him from being further incarcerated. While Bo works on gaining dominance over the local drug trade, Boyd collects a camp of spiritually reformed criminals whom he trains to blow up [[meth lab|meth houses]] in the county to \"clean up Harlan\".  The explosions cause a few casualties, leading Raylan and the other U.S. Marshals to keep an eye on the team.\n\nIn the meantime, Raylan is dealing with personal dilemmas, including working in the same building as his ex-wife ([[Natalie Zea]]), for whom he still has feelings. His continuing visits to Harlan are peppered with small crimes and big shootings, and his success in dealing with these matters draws Bo's attention. Bo promises the niece and nephew of Gio Reyes, head of a Miami drug cartel, that he will deliver Raylan to them in exchange for a large shipment of drugs.  Boyd catches word of this and, with his \"flock\" of reformed prisoners, blows up the truck carrying the shipment, leading the niece and nephew to hold Bo accountable for the damages. This leads Bo to go to Boyd's camp and threaten to kill his own son, illustrating the harsh family relations that provide some insight into how Boyd turned out the way he has. Instead of killing Boyd, though, Bo offers his son the option to abandon his group, after which Bo will leave all of them alone. Boyd walks away into the forest, where he hears gunshots, and returns to see that all of his followers have been killed. This sends him, depressed, to Raylan's door, saying he will help Raylan find Bo as long as he is allowed to be the one to kill him.\n\nAn earlier plan is foiled, involving Arlo's shooting Raylan, to deliver Raylan into Bo's clutches, then handing him over to Gio, but Bo has taken Ava hostage. This is the turning point that drives Boyd and Raylan to join forces for the first time, and Boyd leads him to the Crowder cabin. There, Raylan manages to kill one of Bo's henchmen. As Raylan and Bo are walking to the cabin, Boyd appears ready to shoot and kill Bo. Before Boyd has an opportunity, Bo is shot and killed by a sniper, who then starts shooting at Raylan and Boyd, who take cover in the cabin. They discover they are surrounded by Gio's niece and nephew plus two other gunmen, who then attack the cabin with machine guns. Boyd, Ava, and Raylan are trapped; the niece and nephew demand Raylan be turned over to them.\n\nAfter Boyd attempts to pass himself off as Raylan, and Raylan kills two of the gunmen, Raylan tells Boyd and Ava to leave out the back way, and he walks forward, hands in the air. As the niece steps out from behind her car, the nephew attempts to shoot Raylan, Boyd shoots the nephew, and the niece drives away. Boyd wants to chase her, but Raylan stops him, saying it is against the law. However, Boyd absconds in Bo's car, but doesn't use violence. This signifies the beginning of an uneasy friendship between the two characters that will continue throughout the series.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|Justified (season 2)}}\nSeason 2 deals primarily with the criminal dealings of the Bennett clan. Family matriarch Mags Bennett ([[Margo Martindale]]) and her three sons Dickie ([[Jeremy Davies]]), Coover ([[Brad William Henke]]), and Doyle (Joseph Lyle Taylor), Chief of Bennett Hollow Police, plan to expand their marijuana business into Crowder territory following Bo's death, as Boyd has proven somewhat reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps.  Raylan gets involved in the struggle between the two criminal organizations, and because of a long-standing feud between the Givens and Bennett families centering on an incident between Raylan and Dickie in their youth (which left Dickie with a lame leg), matters grow very complicated, with the pair's pasts catching up with them. Meanwhile, an effort by a mining conglomerate to secure access rights to the mountain results in Raylan and Boyd becoming involved on opposite sides of the operation. This provokes a local backlash against the Bennetts, after Boyd reveals Mags' secret involvement in negotiations with the conglomerate, to the detriment of her neighbors.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|Justified (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 introduces a new main villain, Robert Quarles ([[Neal McDonough]]) of Detroit. The criminal organization connected to the [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] mob has exiled Quarles to Kentucky. Quarles allies himself with local enforcer Wynn Duffy ([[Jere Burns]]) and begins to supplant the local criminals when Raylan begins investigating. Quarles' efforts also bring him into conflict with Boyd's group, resulting in the deaths of several locals. Simultaneously, Dickie Bennett, the lone survivor of the Bennett clan, seeks the aid of the African-American residents of Noble's Holler and their leader, Ellstin Limehouse ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), to recover his inheritance. Limehouse attempts to keep his people out of the struggle between the criminal groups but becomes involved when Boyd gets the upper hand on Quarles, leading to a series of betrayals and deaths.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{Main|Justified (season 4)}}\nSeason 4 is about a mystery which was left unsolved for 30 years. On January 21, 1983, a man wearing a defective parachute plummets onto a residential street in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], dying instantly. His body is surrounded by bags full of cocaine and an ID tag for a \"Waldo Truth\". Raylan learns of the mystery when a vintage [[diplomatic bag]] is found hidden at Arlo's house containing only Waldo Truth's ID tag. Further investigation indicates that the parachutist died and Raylan's father Arlo hid the bag, but he refuses to divulge any information.\n\nAs the investigation continues to unfold, information is revealed that could lead to the arrest of a major mafia figure. Raylan is now living above a bar and attempting to stash extra money away to provide for his unborn child and is in a questionable relationship with the bartender, Lindsey Salazar. Boyd Crowder seeks to expand his empire with help from an old army buddy Colton \"Colt\" Rhodes ([[Ron Eldard]]). Boyd's efforts are complicated by the arrival of a [[snake handling]] revival preacher named Billy St. Cyr ([[Joe Mazzello]]). Billy's success is cutting into Boyd's profits, as his users and dealers are getting hooked on faith instead of drugs. Boyd's cousin Johnny ([[David Meunier]]) grows ever more resentful of Boyd's success and plans to betray him to Wynn Duffy. Boyd's ambition has him force a deal with Duffy that involves Boyd chasing down leads in the same parachutist mystery, eventually bringing Boyd to an unexpected crossroads that threatens his personal or professional destruction.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{Main|Justified (season 5)}}\nSeason 5 features the alligator-farming Crowe crime family,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|title=Ask Ausiello: ''Rookie Blue'', ''Castle'', ''SVU'', ''Justified'', ''Nikita'', ''TVD'', ''Parenthood'', ''HIMYM'' and More!|url=http://tvline.com/2013/09/17/justified-season-5-crowe-family-spoilers-ask-ausiello/|publisher=TVLine|date=September 17, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref> led by Darryl Crowe, Jr. (played by [[Michael Rapaport]]).<ref>{{cite web| last= Ausiello |first= Michael |title=''Justified'' Exclusive: Michael Rapaport Joins Season 5 Cast... as the New Big Bad?|url=http://tvline.com/2013/09/28/justified-season-5-michael-rapaport-cast-spoilers/|publisher=TVLine|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Jere Burns, who recurred in the first four seasons as Wynn Duffy, was made a series regular.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Jere Burns Upped On 'Justified', Michael Rispoli, Ruth Negga, Danielle Nicolet In Arcs|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/jere-burns-upped-on-justified-michael-rispoli-ruth-negga-danielle-nicolet-in-arcs/|publisher=Deadline|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Season 6===\n{{Main|Justified (season 6)}}\nSeason 6 revolves around the culmination of Raylan and Boyd's rivalry, complicated by Ava's betrayal, the machinations of Avery Markham, and a plot to rob him by Boyd, Wynn Duffy and Markham's secret adversary. Boyd succeeds in robbing Markham, but Raylan's plan to entrap him with Ava's help has tragic consequences. Raylan's job, life, and future are all threatened in a way they have never been before.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Justified characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Raylan Givens]], a lawman who, after making headlines killing a fugitive, is sent to Kentucky, where he gets deeply involved in the criminal element of his hometown. Raylan was born and raised in Harlan, Kentucky, where his father was a well-known career criminal. Raylan suffered emotional and likely physical abuse from his father Arlo. During high school, Raylan played baseball and eventually went to work in the Kentucky coal mines, where he worked with Boyd Crowder. Raylan went to college with money given to him by his aunt. After graduating he became a deputy U.S. Marshal, driving him back to Kentucky. He is divorced from Winona Hawkins, a court stenographer, and is often involved with a variety of women. Raylan is known for wearing a distinctive cowboy hat.\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Art Mullen, who knows Raylan from [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers|Glynco]]. He generally follows the law, but gives Raylan some leeway when he trusts his judgment. Art is more of a father figure to Raylan than Arlo, but becomes distrustful of him after he demonstrates his inability to separate his personal and professional lives, frequently toeing the line between right and wrong.\n* [[Joelle Carter]] as Ava Crowder, a woman from Harlan who grew up with Raylan and Boyd. Prior to the events of the show, she was married to Boyd's abusive brother Bowman, whom she killed. As the show progresses, Ava becomes central to Harlan's crime syndicate in her own right.\n* [[Jacob Pitts]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Tim Gutterson, a sardonic former [[United States Army Rangers|Army Ranger]] sniper who is generally unimpressed by Raylan's antics. Art worries that Tim bottles up his PTSD and is likely to blow at any minute.\n* [[Erica Tazel]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal Rachel Brooks, a straight-and-narrow marshal who frequently informs Raylan that he wouldn't get away with his behavior if he weren't white, male, and handsome.\n* [[Natalie Zea]] as Winona Hawkins (regular seasons 1\u20133, recurring seasons 4\u20136), Raylan's ex-wife. At the show's start, she is married to Gary Hawkins, a real estate agent. She works at the same courthouse as Raylan as a court stenographer. She still loves Raylan, but does not trust him as a safe choice given his profession and his tendency to get into trouble.\n* [[Walton Goggins]] as Boyd Crowder (recurring season 1, regular seasons 2\u20136), the son of one of Harlan's biggest career criminals. Boyd is known for robbing banks and using pyrotechnics, which brings Raylan, with whom he used to dig coal, back to Harlan. At the start of the series Boyd is a born-again, tent-preaching white supremacist, though he later moves on to attempting to control Harlan's criminal underground.\n* [[Jere Burns]] as Wynn Duffy (recurring seasons 1\u20134, regular seasons 5\u20136), a shady [[Dixie Mafia]] businessman who travels around in a motor home and who becomes involved in Harlan crime.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[David Meunier]] as Johnny Crowder (seasons 1\u20135), Boyd's cousin.\n* [[Raymond J. Barry]] as Arlo Givens (seasons 1\u20134, 6), Raylan's father and a criminal who often worked with Bo Crowder, but who is now suffering from a form of dementia.\n* [[Rick Gomez]] as Assistant U.S. Attorney David Vasquez (seasons 1, 3\u20136), who works with Art, Raylan, and the other Kentucky marshals.\n* [[M.C.

In response to his controversial but \"justified\" quick-draw shooting of mob [[hitman]] Tommy Bucks in Miami, Givens is reassigned to [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. The Eastern District of Kentucky Marshal's Office is based in Lexington, and its jurisdiction includes [[Harlan County, Kentucky|Harlan County]], where Raylan was raised and which he thought he had escaped for good in his youth.\n\n===Season 1===\n{{Main|Justified (season 1)}}\nThe story arc of season one concentrates on the crimes of the Crowder family. Raylan seeks to protect Ava Crowder ([[Joelle Carter]]) from the rest of the Crowder clan after she shoots her husband, Bowman Crowder, dead in retaliation for years of abuse. Her biggest threat initially comes from Boyd Crowder ([[Walton Goggins]]), a local criminal masquerading as a [[white supremacist]] whom Raylan shoots in a stand-off. Boyd survives the shot to the chest and claims it is a sign from God that he should change his ways. Raylan hesitates to believe him, but Boyd is soon sent to prison, where he spends his time reading the Bible and preaching to convicts. The season builds towards the release of family patriarch Bo ([[M.C. Gainey]]), who wishes to rebuild his family's drug trade and to settle old scores, including one with Raylan's father, Arlo ([[Raymond J. Barry]]), who has cheated him out of money. Bo's release is soon followed by Boyd's, after a technicality prevents him from being further incarcerated. While Bo works on gaining dominance over the local drug trade, Boyd collects a camp of spiritually reformed criminals whom he trains to blow up [[meth lab|meth houses]] in the county to \"clean up Harlan\".  The explosions cause a few casualties, leading Raylan and the other U.S. Marshals to keep an eye on the team.\n\nIn the meantime, Raylan is dealing with personal dilemmas, including working in the same building as his ex-wife ([[Natalie Zea]]), for whom he still has feelings. His continuing visits to Harlan are peppered with small crimes and big shootings, and his success in dealing with these matters draws Bo's attention. Bo promises the niece and nephew of Gio Reyes, head of a Miami drug cartel, that he will deliver Raylan to them in exchange for a large shipment of drugs.  Boyd catches word of this and, with his \"flock\" of reformed prisoners, blows up the truck carrying the shipment, leading the niece and nephew to hold Bo accountable for the damages. This leads Bo to go to Boyd's camp and threaten to kill his own son, illustrating the harsh family relations that provide some insight into how Boyd turned out the way he has. Instead of killing Boyd, though, Bo offers his son the option to abandon his group, after which Bo will leave all of them alone. Boyd walks away into the forest, where he hears gunshots, and returns to see that all of his followers have been killed. This sends him, depressed, to Raylan's door, saying he will help Raylan find Bo as long as he is allowed to be the one to kill him.\n\nAn earlier plan is foiled, involving Arlo's shooting Raylan, to deliver Raylan into Bo's clutches, then handing him over to Gio, but Bo has taken Ava hostage. This is the turning point that drives Boyd and Raylan to join forces for the first time, and Boyd leads him to the Crowder cabin. There, Raylan manages to kill one of Bo's henchmen. As Raylan and Bo are walking to the cabin, Boyd appears ready to shoot and kill Bo. Before Boyd has an opportunity, Bo is shot and killed by a sniper, who then starts shooting at Raylan and Boyd, who take cover in the cabin. They discover they are surrounded by Gio's niece and nephew plus two other gunmen, who then attack the cabin with machine guns. Boyd, Ava, and Raylan are trapped; the niece and nephew demand Raylan be turned over to them.\n\nAfter Boyd attempts to pass himself off as Raylan, and Raylan kills two of the gunmen, Raylan tells Boyd and Ava to leave out the back way, and he walks forward, hands in the air. As the niece steps out from behind her car, the nephew attempts to shoot Raylan, Boyd shoots the nephew, and the niece drives away. Boyd wants to chase her, but Raylan stops him, saying it is against the law. However, Boyd absconds in Bo's car, but doesn't use violence. This signifies the beginning of an uneasy friendship between the two characters that will continue throughout the series.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{Main|Justified (season 2)}}\nSeason 2 deals primarily with the criminal dealings of the Bennett clan. Family matriarch Mags Bennett ([[Margo Martindale]]) and her three sons Dickie ([[Jeremy Davies]]), Coover ([[Brad William Henke]]), and Doyle (Joseph Lyle Taylor), Chief of Bennett Hollow Police, plan to expand their marijuana business into Crowder territory following Bo's death, as Boyd has proven somewhat reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps.  Raylan gets involved in the struggle between the two criminal organizations, and because of a long-standing feud between the Givens and Bennett families centering on an incident between Raylan and Dickie in their youth (which left Dickie with a lame leg), matters grow very complicated, with the pair's pasts catching up with them. Meanwhile, an effort by a mining conglomerate to secure access rights to the mountain results in Raylan and Boyd becoming involved on opposite sides of the operation. This provokes a local backlash against the Bennetts, after Boyd reveals Mags' secret involvement in negotiations with the conglomerate, to the detriment of her neighbors.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{Main|Justified (season 3)}}\nSeason 3 introduces a new main villain, Robert Quarles ([[Neal McDonough]]) of Detroit. The criminal organization connected to the [[Frankfort, Kentucky]] mob has exiled Quarles to Kentucky. Quarles allies himself with local enforcer Wynn Duffy ([[Jere Burns]]) and begins to supplant the local criminals when Raylan begins investigating. Quarles' efforts also bring him into conflict with Boyd's group, resulting in the deaths of several locals. Simultaneously, Dickie Bennett, the lone survivor of the Bennett clan, seeks the aid of the African-American residents of Noble's Holler and their leader, Ellstin Limehouse ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), to recover his inheritance. Limehouse attempts to keep his people out of the struggle between the criminal groups but becomes involved when Boyd gets the upper hand on Quarles, leading to a series of betrayals and deaths.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{Main|Justified (season 4)}}\nSeason 4 is about a mystery which was left unsolved for 30 years. On January 21, 1983, a man wearing a defective parachute plummets onto a residential street in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], dying instantly. His body is surrounded by bags full of cocaine and an ID tag for a \"Waldo Truth\". Raylan learns of the mystery when a vintage [[diplomatic bag]] is found hidden at Arlo's house containing only Waldo Truth's ID tag. Further investigation indicates that the parachutist died and Raylan's father Arlo hid the bag, but he refuses to divulge any information.\n\nAs the investigation continues to unfold, information is revealed that could lead to the arrest of a major mafia figure. Raylan is now living above a bar and attempting to stash extra money away to provide for his unborn child and is in a questionable relationship with the bartender, Lindsey Salazar. Boyd Crowder seeks to expand his empire with help from an old army buddy Colton \"Colt\" Rhodes ([[Ron Eldard]]). Boyd's efforts are complicated by the arrival of a [[snake handling]] revival preacher named Billy St. Cyr ([[Joe Mazzello]]). Billy's success is cutting into Boyd's profits, as his users and dealers are getting hooked on faith instead of drugs. Boyd's cousin Johnny ([[David Meunier]]) grows ever more resentful of Boyd's success and plans to betray him to Wynn Duffy. Boyd's ambition has him force a deal with Duffy that involves Boyd chasing down leads in the same parachutist mystery, eventually bringing Boyd to an unexpected crossroads that threatens his personal or professional destruction.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{Main|Justified (season 5)}}\nSeason 5 features the alligator-farming Crowe crime family,<ref>{{cite web|last=Ausiello|first=Michael|title=Ask Ausiello: ''Rookie Blue'', ''Castle'', ''SVU'', ''Justified'', ''Nikita'', ''TVD'', ''Parenthood'', ''HIMYM'' and More!|url=http://tvline.com/2013/09/17/justified-season-5-crowe-family-spoilers-ask-ausiello/|publisher=TVLine|date=September 17, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref> led by Darryl Crowe, Jr. (played by [[Michael Rapaport]]).<ref>{{cite web| last= Ausiello |first= Michael |title=''Justified'' Exclusive: Michael Rapaport Joins Season 5 Cast... as the New Big Bad?|url=http://tvline.com/2013/09/28/justified-season-5-michael-rapaport-cast-spoilers/|publisher=TVLine|date=September 28, 2013|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Jere Burns, who recurred in the first four seasons as Wynn Duffy, was made a series regular.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Jere Burns Upped On 'Justified', Michael Rispoli, Ruth Negga, Danielle Nicolet In Arcs|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/09/jere-burns-upped-on-justified-michael-rispoli-ruth-negga-danielle-nicolet-in-arcs/|publisher=Deadline|date=September 18, 2013|accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Season 6===\n{{Main|Justified (season 6)}}\nSeason 6 revolves around the culmination of Raylan and Boyd's rivalry, complicated by Ava's betrayal, the machinations of Avery Markham, and a plot to rob him by Boyd, Wynn Duffy and Markham's secret adversary. Boyd succeeds in robbing Markham, but Raylan's plan to entrap him with Ava's help has tragic consequences. Raylan's job, life, and future are all threatened in a way they have never been before.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Justified characters}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Raylan Givens]], a lawman who, after making headlines killing a fugitive, is sent to Kentucky, where he gets deeply involved in the criminal element of his hometown.

During high school, Raylan played baseball and eventually went to work in the Kentucky coal mines, where he worked with Boyd Crowder. Raylan went to college with money given to him by his aunt.

Raylan is known for wearing a distinctive cowboy hat.\n* [[Nick Searcy]] as Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Art Mullen, who knows Raylan from [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers|Glynco]].

Boyd is known for robbing banks and using pyrotechnics, which brings Raylan, with whom he used to dig coal, back to Harlan.
