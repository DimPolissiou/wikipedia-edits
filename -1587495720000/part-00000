The variety spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk|title=Chavacano|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref> Chavacano is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_chabacano_versus_related_creoles.htm|title=The Early History of Chavacano de Zamboanga: Chabacano versus related creoles|website=www.zamboanga.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally [[mutually intelligible]] by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], their grammatical structures are generally similar to other [[Philippine languages]]. Among [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], it is the only one that is not an [[Austronesian language]], but like [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], it uses [[reduplication]].\n\nThe word ''{{wiktes|chabacano|Chabacano}}'' is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning \"poor taste\" or \"vulgar\", though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers and has lost its original Spanish meaning.\n\n== Distribution and variants ==\n\n===Varieties===\n[[Image:Map chavacano.gif|thumb|right|190px|Native Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers in Mindanao]]\n\nLinguists have identified at least six Spanish Creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their [[substratum|substrate languages]] and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as their substrate language are the [[Luzon]]-based creoles of which are '''Cavite\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Cavite City]]), '''Bahra''' or '''Ternate\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite]]) and '''Ermite\u00f1o''' (once spoken in the old district of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] in [[Manila]] and is now extinct).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Variety\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Places\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Native speakers\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Zamboangue\u00f1o (Zamboangue\u00f1o/Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano/Chabacano de Zamboanga)'''||'''[[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]],''' || 359,000 (Rubino 2008, citing 2000 census)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">Ethnologue</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cavite\u00f1o (Chabacano di Nisos/Chabacano de Cavite)'''||'''[[Cavite]]'''|| 4,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cotabate\u00f1o (Chabacano de Cotabato)'''||'''[[Cotabato City]], [[Maguindanao]]'''|| Dead\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Castellano Abakay (Chabacano Davaoe\u00f1o)'''||'''[[Davao Region]],''' '''[[Davao City]]'''|| Extinct \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ternate\u00f1o (Bahra)'''||'''[[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]]'''|| 3,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ermite\u00f1o (Ermitense)'''||'''[[Ermita]]'''|| Extinct\n|}\n\nThere are a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is believed to have been influenced by Cavite\u00f1o Chabacano as evidenced by prominent [[Zamboangue\u00f1o]] families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]), primarily Cavite\u00f1o mestizos, stationed at [[Fort Pilar]] in the 19th century. When Cavite\u00f1o officers recruited workers and technicians from [[Iloilo]] to man their [[sugar]] plantations and [[rice]] fields to reduce the local population's dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, the Spanish colonial government levied taxes on the islanders to support the fort's operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano was infused with Hiligaynon words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205215037/http://www.zamboanga.org/chavacano/chabacano_by_ben_saavedra.htm|title=Mensajes Y Noticias|date=2005-02-05|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nMost of what appears to be [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words in Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano are actually Hiligaynon. Although Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano's contact with Cebuano began much earlier when Cebuano soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Cebuano accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\n'''Zamboangue\u00f1o''' (Chavacano) is spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], parts of [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to Cotabato and Davao in Mindanao, and finally down south to Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=The Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages and the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, In Retrospect|journal=Creole Language in Creole Literatures|volume=20|issue=1|pages=167\u2013174|doi=10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|issn=0920-9034}}</ref> The other varieties of Chavacano with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as their primary substrate language are the [[Mindanao]]-based creoles of which are '''Castellano Abakay''' or '''Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o''' (now extinct but was spoken in some areas of [[Davao City|Davao]]), influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and divided into two varieties, ''Castellano Abakay Chino'' and ''Castellano Abakay Jap\u00f3n'', and '''Cotabate\u00f1o''' (no longer spoken in [[Cotabato City]]). Both Cotabate\u00f1o and Davaoe\u00f1o are very similar to Zamboangue\u00f1o.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on [[Mexican Spanish]] and possibly, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with [[Andalusian Spanish]], but there are many words borrowed from [[Nahuatl]], a language native to Central Mexico, which aren\u2019t found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], primarily [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages [[Nahuatl]], [[Taino]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], etc. as can be evidenced by the words chongo (monkey, instead of Spanish '{{wiktspa|mono}}'), tiange (mini markets), etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine [[Austronesian languages]] including [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Words of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin are present in the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. As the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, most commonly [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]].{{specify|date=February 2018}}{{dubious|date=February 2018}} In spite of this, it\u2019s difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are [[Indo-European languages]].\n\n===Demographics===\nThe highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in '''[[Zamboanga City]]''' and in the island province of [[Basilan]]. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure doesn\u2019t include Chavacano speakers of the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]]. All the same, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.\n\nChavacano speakers are also found in [[Semporna]] and elsewhere in Sabah as Sabah was under partial Spanish sovereignty and via Filipino refugees who escaped from [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like [[Sulu Archipelago]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Susanne Michaelis|title=Roots of Creole Structures: Weighing the Contribution of Substrates and Superstrates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPUeQLcGMOMC|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-5255-6}}</ref>\n\nA small number of Zamboanga's indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]]s, the [[Samal people|Samals]], and the [[Yakan]]s, majority of those people are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] areas, there are Muslim speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', both Christians and Muslims, also live in [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]. Christians and Muslims in [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Saranggani]] speak ''Chavacano de Zamboanga''. Take note that [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, [[Maguindanao]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Soccsksargen]] (region that composed of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], and [[Saranggani]]) and Davao Region became part of short-lived [[Republic of Zamboanga]], which chose Chavacano as [[official language]].\n\n===Social significance===\nChavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangue\u00f1o and access to these resources by the general public isn\u2019t readily available; Bibles of Protestant Christians are also written in standard Chavacano. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of [[Qur'an]] books are published in Chavacano.\n\nThe Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangue\u00f1o has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardization, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The [[Instituto Cervantes]] in Manila hosted a conference entitled \"Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language\" at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Starting school year 2012\u201313, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education's policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.\n\nBecause of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangue\u00f1o) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.{{says who}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term '''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' originated from the Spanish word ''{{wiktspa|chabacano}}'' which literally means \"poor taste\", \"vulgar\", \"common\", \"of low quality\", or \"coarse\". Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, what is today called ''Chavacano'' was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the \"''lenguaje de la calle''\", \"''lenguaje de parian''\" (language of the street), or \"''lenguaje de cocina''\" (kitchen Spanish) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.\n\nLinguists use the term '''Philippine Creole Spanish''' which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternate\u00f1o and Cavite\u00f1o) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangue\u00f1o). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] (mostly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]), [[Subanon language|Subanon]], and [[Sama language|Sama]] as their substrate language(s). \n\nChavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Noun phrases in Creole languages : a multi-faceted approach|date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Baptista, Marlyse., Gu\u00e9ron, Jacqueline.|isbn=9789027291820|location=Amsterdam|oclc=233632814}}</ref> They emphasise the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, most people are using the V in spelling the language as Chavacano. In the three-day Chavacano Orthography Congress held on Nov 19-21, 2014, wherein it included the presentation by researchers on Chavacano, mostly results from surveys conducted among selected respondents in the city, the newly organized Chavacano Orthography Council met with the officials of the Department of Education and agreed among others that the language is to be spelled with the V. Most people in support of this move would like to distance their language Chavacano to the word Chabacano which also means \u2018vulgar\u201d in Spanish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chavacano/Chabacano varieties and alternative names\n!Location\n!Geographical area\n!Alternative names and spellings\n|-\n|Zamboanga\n|Mindanao\n|Chavacano, Zamboangue\u00f1o, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n|-\n|Cavite\n|Manila Bay\n|Chabacano de Cavite, Cavite\u00f1, Caviten, Linguaje de Niso\n|-\n|Basilan\n|Mindanao\n|Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano de Zamboanga\n|-\n|Cotabato\n|Mindanao\n|Cotabate\u00f1, Cotabato Chavacano\n|-\n|Davao\n|Mindanao\n|Davaoe\u00f1o, Davaoe\u00f1o Zamboangue\u00f1o, Castellano Abakay, Davao Chavacano\n|-\n|Ermita\n|Manila Bay\n|Ermitense, Ermita Chabacano\n|-\n|Ternate\n|Manila Bay\n|Ternate\u00f1o, Ternate\u00f1o Chabacano, Bahra, Linguaje di Bahra\n|}\n\n==Historical background==\n\nThere is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacano developed.\n\nPrior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]]s inhabiting them. The [[Spanish Colonisation of the Philippines|Spanish colonisation]] of the Philippine islands had led to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.\n\nCreole languages (such as [[French-based creole]]s) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocabulary of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: [[Papiamento]], [[Palenquero]], and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish', and fluent Spanish.<ref>Lipski, J. M. Chabacano/Spanish and the Philippine linguistic identity.</ref> The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Mart\u00ednez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, ''Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas'', notes that \"In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Mentions of a vernacular referred to as \"kitchen Spanish\" and \"language of the market\" (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.\n\nThe manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called ''Chabacano'' may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (''Supercher\u00edas'') and 28 (''Tatakut'') of Filipino writer [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s 1891 work ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.<ref>text reproduced by [https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/chabacano-in-el-filibusterismo/ Filipino Scribbles]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/roger_santos/rizal.html | title=Chabacano - Cavite's Dialect}}</ref> The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:\n\n{{quote|''\u00bfPorque ba no di pod\u00ed nis\u00f3s entr\u00e1?'' preguntaba una voz de mujer.\n\n\u2015''Ab\u00e1, \u00f1ora, porque \u2018tall\u00e1 el man\u00e1 prailes y el man\u00e1 empleau'', contest\u00f3 un hombre; ''\u2018ta jas\u00ed solo para il\u00f3s el cabesa de espinge''.\n\n\u2015''\u00a1Curioso tambi\u00e9n el man\u00e1 prailes!'' dijo la voz de mujer alej\u00e1ndose; ''\u00a1no quiere pa que di sab\u00e9 nisos cuando ilos ta sali inga\u00f1au! \u00a1Cosa! \u00a1Querida be de praile el cabesa!''}}\n\nIn the 1883 work of German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]] ''Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen'', he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls \"Malayo-Spanish\". However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work ''The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands ''. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls \"Ermita\u00f1o\" of Ermita in Manila, \"Cavite\u00f1o\" of Cavite and \"Zamboangue\u00f1o\" of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulated his [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] on the origin of these vernaculars.\n\nLinguists are unsettled on how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are: Whinnom's \"monogenetic theory\" and a \"parallel-development\" theory proposed by Frake in 1971.\n\n===Monogenetic theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nAccording to the Monogentic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source and that varieties are related to each other.\n\n===Parallel-development theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\nOn 23 June 1635, [[Zamboanga City]] became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the [[Fort Pilar|San Jos\u00e9 Fortress]]. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.\n\nThe military authorities decided to import labour from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.\n\nLanguage differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A [[pidgin]] developed and became a full-fledged [[creole language]] still in use today as a [[lingua franca]] and/or as [[official language]], mainly in [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nWhen the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] gave up its territories in [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognised partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, [[Germany]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed an agreement named the [[Madrid Protocol of 1885]] that recognised Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan); although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the [[Spanish East Indies]] area as stated on the Protocol and control by the [[United Kingdom]], Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.\n\nFrom then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.\n\n===Cavite\u00f1o / Ternate\u00f1o{{anchor|Cavite\u00f1o}}===\nThe [[Merdicas]] (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were [[Catholic]] natives of the islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] of the [[Moluccas]] in the vicinity of [[New Guinea]], converted during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupation of the islands by [[Jesuit]] missionaries. The islands were later captured by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] who vied for their control with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate were forced to pull out to defend [[Manila]] against an impending invasion by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the [[Maragondon]] river (known as the ''Barra de Maragondon'') and [[Tanza, Cavite]], Manila.<ref name=\"lipski\">{{cite book|author=John.

Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.\n\nIn the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.\n\nIn the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangue\u00f1o mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.\n\nThe following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Chavacano (formal)\n!Chavacano (common/colloquial/vulgar/familiar)\n!Spanish\n|-\n|slippery\n|resbalozo/resbaladizo\n|malandug\n|resbaloso/resbaladizo\n|-\n|rice\n|morisqueta\n|kanon/arroz\n|morisqueta (understood as a Filipino rice dish)/arroz\n|-\n|rain\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|aguacero/ulan\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|-\n|dish\n|vianda/comida\n|comida/ulam\n|vianda/comida\n|-\n|braggart/boastful\n|orgulloso(a)\n|bugalon(a)/ hambuguero(a)\n|orgulloso(a)\n|-\n|car\n|coche\n|auto\n|auto/coche\n|-\n|housemaid\n|muchacho (m)/muchacha (f)\n|ayudanta (female); ayudante (male)\n|muchacha(o)/ayudante\n|-\n|father\n|pap\u00e1 (tata)\n|p\u00e1pang (tata)\n|pap\u00e1 (padre)\n|-\n|mother\n|mam\u00e1 (nana)\n|m\u00e1mang (nana)\n|mam\u00e1 (madre)\n|-\n|grandfather\n|abuelo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|-\n|grandmother\n|abuela\n|abuela/lola\n|abuela/lela\n|-\n|small\n|chico(a)/peque\u00f1o(a)\n|peque\u00f1o(a)/diutay\n|peque\u00f1o/chico\n|-\n|nuisance\n|fastidio\n|asarante / salawayun\n|fastidio\n|-\n|hard-headed\n|testarudo\n|duro cabeza/duro pulso\n|testarudo/cabeza dura\n|-\n|slippers\n|chancla\n|chinelas\n|chancla/chinelas\n|-\n|married\n|de estado/de estao\n|casado/casao\n|casado\n|-\n|(my) parents\n|(mis) padres\n|(mi) tata'y nana\n|(mis) padres\n|-\n|naughty\n|travieso(a)\n|guachi / guachinanggo(a)\n|travieso(a)\n|-\n|slide\n|rezbalasa/deslizar\n|landug\n|resbalar/deslizar\n|-\n|ugly\n|feo (masculine)/fea (feminine)\n|malacara, malacuka\n|feo(a)\n|-\n|rainshower\n|lluve\n|tal\u00edtih\n|lluvia\n|-\n|lightning\n|rayo\n|rayo/quirlat\n|rayo\n|-\n|thunder/thunderstorm\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|-\n|tornado\n|tornado/remolino, remulleno\n|ipo-ipo\n|tornado/remolino\n|-\n|thin (person)\n|delgado(a)/flaco(a)/chiquito(a)\n|flaco/flaquit\n|delgado/flaco/flaquito\n|}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{contradiction|Are there 29 or 30 letters--is <rr> a letter?|date=January 2016}}\n\nChavacano is written using the [[Latin script]]. As Chavacano has mostly been a [[spoken language]] than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the [[Filipino language]] in education and the media as the national language, Filipino's orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.\n\nThe kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written \"phonetically\", similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach, using phonetic spelling for words of Filipino origin and Spanish spelling rules for words of Spanish origin.\n\nin Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter ''k'' appear mostly in words of [[Austronesian]] origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as ''kame'', ''kita'', ''kanamon'', ''kaninyo'').\n<!--Unsourced:\nSome additional characters like the ''\u00f1'' (''e\u00f1e'', representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, a letter distinct from ''n'' but typographically composed of an ''n'' with a [[tilde]]), the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}), the ''ll'' ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}}), and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' ({{lang|es|erre}} with strong ''r'') exist in Chavacano.-->\n\nIt is uncommon in modern written works to include the [[acute accent]] and the [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters ''\u00f1'' and ''ll'' are sometimes replaced by ''ny'' and ''ly'' in informal texts.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nThe Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including <ch>, <ll>, <\u00f1> and <rr>:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Languages of the Southern Gateway: Chavacano, Sinama, Tausug, Yakan|last=Department of Education, Culture and Sports and The Summer Institute of Linguistics|publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1979|isbn=978-9711801311|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=}}</ref>\n\n'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''ch''', '''d''', '''e''', '''f''', '''g''', '''h''', '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', '''l''', '''ll''', '''m''', '''n''', '''\u00f1''', '''o''', '''p''', '''q''', '''r''', '''rr''', '''s''', '''t''', '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''', '''z'''\n\n====Letters and letter names====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | A a || style=\"width: 17em;\" | '''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | J j || style=\"width: 20em;\" | '''jota''' {{IPA|/\u02c8xota/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | R r || style=\"width: 25em;\" | '''ere''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u027ee/}}\n|-\n| B b || '''be''' {{IPA|/be/}}<br>\n| K k || '''ka''' {{IPA|/ka/}}\n| Rr rr || '''erre''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ere/}}\n|-\n| C c || '''ce'''  {{IPA|/se/}}\n| L l || '''ele''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ele/}}\n| S s || '''ese''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ese/}}\n|-\n| Ch ch || '''che''' {{IPA|/t\u0283e/}}\n| Ll ll || '''elle''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u028ee/}}\n| T t || '''te''' {{IPA|/te/}}\n|-\n| D d || '''de''' {{IPA|/de/}}\n| M m || '''eme''' {{IPA|/\u02c8eme/}}\n| U u || '''u''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n|-\n| E e || '''e''' {{IPA|/e/}}\n| N n || '''ene''' {{IPA|/ene/}}\n| V v || '''uve''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ube/}}\n|-\n| F f || '''efe''' {{IPA|/\u02c8efe/}}\n| \u00d1 \u00f1 || '''e\u00f1e''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u0272e/}}\n| W w || '''doble u''' {{IPA|/\u02c8uve doble/}}<br>\n|-\n| G g || '''ge''' {{IPA|/xe/}}\n| O o || '''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n| X x || '''equis''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ekis/}}\n|-\n| H h || '''hache''' {{IPA|/\u02c8at\u0283e/}}\n| P p || '''pe''' {{IPA|/pe/}}\n| Y y || '''ye''' {{IPA|/\u025f\u029de/}}<br>\n|-\n| I i || '''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}<br>\n| Q q || '''cu''' {{IPA|/ku/}}\n| Z z || '''zeta''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seta/}}<br>'''zeda''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seda/}}\n|}\n\nOther letter combinations include ''rr'' (erre), which is pronounced {{IPA|/xr/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, and ''ng,'' which is pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}. Another combination was ''\u00f1g,'' which was pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b/}} but is now obsolete and is only written as ''ng''.\n\nSome sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized ('e' and 'o' becomes 'i' and 'u' in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. ''escoger'' became ''iscuj\u00ed'' in informal speech; ''tiene'' {{IPA|/t\u0283\u025bn\u025b/}}; ''Dios'' {{IPA|/d\u0292\u0254s/}}; ''Castilla'' became {{IPA|/kastilla/}} instead of {{IPA|/kasti\u028ea/}}).\n\nGlottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jend\u00ea = not; ol\u00ea = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.\n\nOther pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:\n\n: f ~ {{IPA|/p/}}\n: j, g (before 'e' and 'i') ~ /{{IPA|h}}/ (in common with dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other areas of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|southern Spain]])\n: ch ~ {{IPA|/ts/}}\n: rr ~ {{IPA|/xr/}}\n: di, de ~ {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/ ; dejalo ~ /jalo/)\n: ti, te ~ {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)\n: ci, si ~ {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /kon\u0283en\u0283a/)\n\n[b, d, g] between vowels which are [[fricatives|fricative]] [[allophones]] are pronounced as they are in Chavacano.\n\n===Other sounds===\n\n: -h {{IPA|/h/}} (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written\n: -g {{IPA|/k/}}; sometimes written as just -k\n: -d {{IPA|/t/}}; sometimes written as just -t\n: -kh [{{IPA link|x}}]; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms\n\n===Sounds from English===\n\n: \u201cv\u201d pronounced as English \u201cv\u201d (like: vase) (vi)\n: \u201cz\u201d pronounced as English \u201cz\u201d (like: zebra)  (zi)\n: \u201cx\u201d pronounced as English \u201cx\u201d (like: X-ray)  (ex/eks)\n: \u201ch\u201d like: house (/eitsh/); sometimes written as 'j'\n\n===Diphthongs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Letters\n!Pronunciation\n!Example\n!Significant\n|-\n|'''ae'''\n| aye\n| ca\u00e9\n| fall, to fall\n|-\n|'''ai'''\n| ay\n| caido\n| fallen, fell\n|-\n|'''ao'''\n| aow\n| cuidao\n| take care, cared\n|-\n|'''ea'''\n| eya\n| pat\u00e9a\n| kick, to kick\n|-\n|'''ei'''\n| ey\n| re\u00ed\n| laugh\n|-\n|'''eo'''\n| eyo\n| v\u00eddeo\n| video\n|-\n|'''ia'''\n| ya\n| advertencia\n| warning, notice\n|-\n|'''ie'''\n| ye\n| cien(to)\n| one hundred, hundred\n|-\n|'''io'''\n| yo\n| canci\u00f3n\n| song\n|-\n|'''iu'''\n| yu\n| saci\u00fat\n| to move the hips a little\n|-\n|'''uo'''\n| ow\n| institutuo\n| institute\n|-\n|'''qu'''\n| ke\n| qu\u00e9, que\n| what, that, than\n|-\n|'''gu'''\n| strong g\n| gu\u00eda\n| to guide, guide\n|-\n|'''ua'''\n| wa\n| agua\n| water\n|-\n|'''ue'''\n| we\n| cuento\n| story\n|-\n|'''ui'''\n| wi\n| cuid\u00e1\n| care, to take care\n|-\n|'''oi'''\n| oy\n| o\u00ed\n| hear, to hear\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Simple sentence structure (verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order)===\n\nChavacano is a language with the [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the \"who\" is emphasized more than the \"what\". Because the mass media represent \"legitimacy\", it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangue\u00f1os) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.\n\n====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nChavacano generally follows the simple verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:\n\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).\n:::(\u2018The businessmen are buying land.\u2019)\n\nThe subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:\n\n:'''Ya and\u00e1 yo na iglesia enantes'''.\n::(\u2018I went to church a while ago.\u2019)\n\n====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nWhen the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words '''jendeh''' (from Tagalog \u2019hindi\u2019 or Hiligaynon 'indi' which means \u2019no\u2019; the Cebuano uses 'dili', which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, '''no hay''' (which literally means \u2019none\u2019) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and '''jend\u00eah''' or '''nunca''' (which means \u2019no\u2019 or \u2019never\u2019) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure:\n\nPresent Tense\n\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::(Eng: The businessmen are not buying land. Span: Los hombres de negocio no est\u00e1n comprando terreno)\n\nPast Tense\n\n:'''No hay compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''No hay compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::(Eng: The businessmen did not buy land.

Span: Los hombres de negocio nunca comprar\u00e1n terreno)\n\nThe negator '''jendeh''' can appear before the subject in a subject\u2013verb\u2013object structure to negate the subject rather than the predicate in the present, past, and future tenses:\n\nPresent Tense\n\n:'''Jend\u00eah el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.\n::(Eng: It is not the businessmen who are buying land but the employees.

Span: No ser\u00eda el hombre de negocio que comprar\u00e1 el terreno sino los empleados)\n\nThe negator '''nunca''' can appear before the subject in a subject\u2013verb\u2013object structure to strongly negate (or denote impossibility) the subject rather than the predicate in the future tense:\n\nFuture Tense\n\n:'''Nunca el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''ay compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.\n:'''Nunca ay compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el mana/maga negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object) '''sino el maga/mana empleados'''.\n::(Eng: It will never be the businessmen who will buy land but the employees. Span: Nunca ser\u00eda el hombre de negocio que comprar\u00e1 el terreno sino los empleados)\n\nThe negator '''no hay''' and '''nunca''' can also appear before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject\u2013verb\u2013object structure in the past and future tenses respectively. Using '''nunca''' before the subject to negate the predicate in a subject\u2013verb\u2013object structure denotes strong negation or impossibility for the subject to perform the action in the future:\n\nPast Tense\n\n:'''No hay el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n::(Eng: The businessmen did not buy land.

Span: el hombre de negocio nunca comprar\u00e1 terreno)\n\n===Nouns and articles===\n\nThe Chavacano definite article '''el''' precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article '''un''' stays constant for gender as 'una' has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like \"una vez\". It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for '''el''' and '''un''' to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:\n\n:'''el caj\u00f3n''' (\u2019the box\u2019) \u2013 '''el maga/mana caj\u00f3n(es)''' (\u2019the boxes\u2019)\n:'''un soltero''' (\u2019a bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''un soltera''' (\u2019a spinster\u2019)\n:'''el un soltero''' (\u2019the bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''el un soltera''' (\u2019the spinster\u2019)\n\nNouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:\n\n:'''Jendeh yo ta llor\u00e1 lagrimas sino sangre'''.\n::(\u2019I do not cry tears but blood\u2019.)\n:'''Ta carg\u00e1 yo palo'''.\n::(\u2019I am carrying wood\u2019).\n\nProper names of persons are preceded by the definite article '''si''' or the phrase '''un tal''' functioning as an indefinite article would:\n\n:'''Un bonita candidata si Maria.'''.\n::(\u2019Maria is a beautiful candidate\u2019.)\n:'''un tal Juancho'''\n::(\u2019a certain Juancho\u2019)\n\n====Singular nouns====\n\nUnlike in Spanish, Chavacano [[nouns]] derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, the [[article (grammar)|article]] 'el' basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article 'la' for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the 'la' as the article is more tolerated than acceptable.  Among the few exceptions where the 'la' occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the 'el', which makes this use of a \"double article\" quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as 'el La Virgen Maria' (the \"L\" of the 'la' capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article 'el' is always safe to use. Compare:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (general and common)\n!Chavacano singular noun (accepted or uncommon)\n|-\n|the virgin\n|el virgen\n|la virgen (accepted)\n|-\n|the peace\n|el paz\n|la paz (accepted)\n|-\n|the sea\n|el mar\n|la mar (accepted)\n|-\n|the cat\n|el gato\n|el gato (la gata is uncommon)\n|-\n|the sun\n|el sol\n|el sol\n|-\n|the moon\n|el luna\n|el luna (la luna is uncommon)\n|-\n|the view\n|el vista\n|la vista (accepted)\n|-\n|the tragedy\n|el tragedia\n|el tragedia (la tragedia is uncommon)\n|-\n|the doctor\n|el doctor\n|el doctora (la doctora is uncommon)\n|}\n\nAnd just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article 'el'. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano singular noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teacher\n|el maestro\n|el maestra\n|-\n|the witch\n|el burujo\n|el buruja\n|-\n|the engineer\n|el engeniero\n|el engeniera\n|-\n|the tailor/seamstress\n|el sastrero\n|el sastrera\n|-\n|the baby\n|el ni\u00f1o\n|el ni\u00f1a\n|-\n|the priest/nun\n|el padre / sacerdote\n|el madre / monja\n|-\n|the grandson/granddaughter\n|el nieto\n|el nieta\n|-\n|the professor\n|el profesor\n|el profesora\n|-\n|the councilor\n|el consejal\n|el consejala\n|}\n\nNot all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article 'el' in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.\n\n:Examples: '''el alcalde''', '''el capitan''', '''el negociante''', '''el ayudante''', '''el chufer'''\n\nAll names of animals are always masculine\u2014in Spanish context\u2014preceded by the article 'el'.\n\n:Examples: '''el gato''' (gata is uncommon), '''el puerco''' (puerca is uncommon), '''el perro''' (perra is uncommon)\n\nNames of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article 'el' always precedes the noun:\n\n:'''el cocina''', '''el pantal\u00f3n''', '''el comida''', '''el camino''', '''el trapo''', '''el ventana''', '''el mar'''\n\n====Plural nouns====\n\nIn Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article 'el'. The Spanish articles 'los' and 'las' have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) 'maga/mana' which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon 'maga' or the Tagalog 'mga'. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, \"the many (noun)\" instead of \"the (noun)s\", and in fact \"the many (noun)s\" is used more in [[Philippine English]] than elsewhere.\n\nThere are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Cavite\u00f1o or Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers) who would tend to say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English plural noun\n!Chavacano plural noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano plural noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teachers\n|el maga/mana maestro(s)\n|el maga/mana maestra(s)\n|-\n|the witches\n|el maga/mana burujo(s)\n|el maga/mana buruja(s)\n|-\n|the engineers\n|el maga/mana engeniero(s)\n|el maga/mana engeniera(s)\n|-\n|the tailors/seamstresses\n|el maga/mana sastrero(s)\n|el maga/mana sastrera(s)\n|-\n|the babies\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1o(s)\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1a(s)\n|-\n|the priests/nuns\n|el maga/mana padre(s)\n|el maga/mana madre(s)\n|-\n|the grandsons/granddaughters\n|el maga/mana nieto(s)\n|el maga/mana nieta(s)\n|-\n|the professors\n|el maga/mana professor(es)\n|el maga/mana profesora(s)\n|-\n|the councilors\n|el maga/mana consejal(es)\n|el maga/mana consejala(s)\n|}\n\nAgain, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangue\u00f1o formal mode). The articles 'los' or 'las' do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:\n\n:'''los caballeros''', '''los dias''', '''las noches''', '''los chavacanos''', '''los santos''', '''las ma\u00f1anas''', '''las almujadas''', '''las mesas''', '''las plumas''', '''las cosas'''\n\nWhen in doubt, it is always safe to use 'el' and 'maga or mana' to pluralize singular nouns:\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballero(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s)''', '''el maga/mana noche(s)''', '''el maga/mana chavacano(s)''', '''el maga/mana santo(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s) que viene''' (this is a phrase; 'el maga/mana ma\u00f1ana' is uncommon), '''el maga/mana almujada(s)''', '''el maga/mana mesa(s)''', '''el maga/mana pluma(s)'''\n\nIn Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called ''[[Reduplication]]'', a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):\n\n:'''el maga cosa-cosa''' (el maga cosa/s is common), '''el maga casa casa''' (el maga casa is common), '''el maga gente gente''' (el maga gente is common), '''el maga juego juego''' (el maga juego is common)\n\nBut note that in some cases, this \"reduplication\" signifies a difference in meaning.  For example,  'el maga bata' means 'the children' but 'el maga bata-bata' means one's followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.\n\nIn general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballeros''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana caballero''' (correct)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00edas''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00eda''' (correct)\n\nAdding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:\n\n:'''el maga meses''', '''el maga mujeres''', '''el maga mayores''', '''el maga tentaciones''', '''el maga contestaciones''', '''el maga naciones''', '''el maga organizaciones'''\n\nHowever, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga mes''', '''el maga mujer''', '''el maga mayor''', '''el maga tentaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga contestaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga naci\u00f3n''', '''el maga organizaci\u00f3n'''\n\n===Pronouns===\n\nChavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.\n\nIn contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: ''common'', ''familiar'', and ''formal''. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The ''common forms'' are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The ''familiar forms'' are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The ''formal forms'' are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.\n\nAdditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive we]] (''kita'') \u2013 including the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 and the [[inclusive and exclusive we|exclusive we]] (''kame'') \u2013 excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 in the first person plural except in the formal form where ''nosotros'' is used for both.\n\n====Personal (nominative/subjective case) pronouns====\n\nBelow is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Cavite\u00f1\n!Bahra\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|yo\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | yo\n|yo (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nako (Chino)\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|[e]vo[s] (common)/(informal)<br>t\u00fa (familiar)<br>usted (formal)\n|vo/bo<br>tu<br>ust\u00e9\n|vo/bo<br>ust\u00e9\n|usted\nvos\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|\u00e9l<br>ele\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | eli\n|\u00e9l\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|kam\u00e9 (exclusive/common/familiar)<br>kit\u00e1 (inclusive/common/familiar)<br>nosotros (formal)\n|nisos\n|mijotro<br>mihotro<br>motro\n|nosotros (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|kam\u00f3 (common)<br> vosotros (familiar)<br> ustedes (formal)\n|vusos<br>busos\n|buhotro<br>bujotro<br>ustedi<br>tedi\n|ustedes\nvosotros\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|sil\u00e1 (common/familiar)<br>ellos (formal)\n|ilos\n|lojotro<br>lohotro<br>lotro\n|ellos\n|}\n\n====Possessive pronouns (Chavacano de Zamboanga, Castellano Abakay)====\n\nThe usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o. ''Amon'', ''Aton'', ''ila'' and ''inyo'' are obviously of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] but not [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangue\u00f1o appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|mi<br>m\u00edo<br>de mi<br>de m\u00edo<br>di mio/di m\u00edo\n|mi\nm\u00edo\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|de vos (''common'')<br>de tu (''familiar'')<br>tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de tuyo/di tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de usted (''formal'')\n|de tu\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|su<br>suyo<br>de su<br>de suyo/di suyo\n|ese (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nde iya (Chino)\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|de am\u00f3n/diamon (''common/familiar'') (exclusive)<br>de at\u00f3n/diaton (''common/familiar'') (inclusive)<br>nuestro (''formal'')<br>de/di nuestro (''formal'')\n|nuestro\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|de i\u00f1o/di inyo (''common'')<br>de vosotros (''familiar'')<br>de ustedes (''formal'')\n|vos\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|de ila (''common/familiar'')<br>de ellos/di ellos (''formal'')\n|de ellos\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangue\u00f1o verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.\n\nGenerally, the simple form of the Zamboangue\u00f1o verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, ''continuar'', ''hablar'', ''poner'', ''recibir'', and ''llevar'' become ''continu\u00e1'', ''habl\u00e1'', ''pon\u00e9'', ''recib\u00ed'', and ''llev\u00e1'' with the accent called \"acento agudo\" on the final syllable.\n\nThere are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, ''dar'' (give) does not become 'da' but ''dale'' (give) (literally in Spanish, to \"give it\" [verb phrase]). In this case, ''dale'' has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive ''dar''. The Chavacano ''brinca'' (to hop) is from Spanish ''brincar'' which means the same thing.\n\n====Verb tenses - simple tenses====\n\nChavacano of Zamboangue\u00f1o uses the words ''ya'' (from Spanish ''ya'' [already]), ''ta'' (from Spanish ''est\u00e1'' [is]), and ''ay'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|ay cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|ay beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|ay dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|ay ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nCavite\u00f1 uses the words ''ya'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Cavite\u00f1 infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nWhile Bahra uses the words ''a'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Bahra ininitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|a cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|a beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|a dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|a ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\nUnlike in the Zamboangue\u00f1o, Cavite\u00f1, and Bahra, Castellano Abakay (Davaoe\u00f1o) doesn't have the ''ya'' and ''ta'' prefix.

First, ''ya'' can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final ''ya''. Second, ''ta'' and ''ya'' can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between ''ta'' and ''pa'' means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o past perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o present perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o future perfect\n|-\n|ya cant\u00e1 ya.\n|ta cant\u00e1 pa. / ta canta ya.\n|ay cant\u00e1 ya.\n|-\n|ya beb\u00e9 ya.\n|ta beb\u00e9 pa. / ta Bebe ya.\n|ay beb\u00e9 ya.\n|-\n|ya dorm\u00ed ya.\n|ta dorm\u00ed pa. / ta dormi ya.\n|ay dorm\u00ed ya.\n|-\n|ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ya ped\u00ed pa. / ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ay ped\u00ed ya.\n|}\n\nThe [[past perfect]] exists in Zamboangue\u00f1o. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using ''ya'' + verb + ''ya'' and another sentence in the simple past tense:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 kame el pel\u00edcula antes de ya compr\u00e1 con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie before we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula despu\u00e9s ya compr\u00e1 kame con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie and then we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano uses a verb between \"hay\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[future perfect]] and [[past perfect]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Future perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Future perfect (English)\n|-\n|Hay mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula si hay lleg\u00e1 vosotros.\n|We will have watched the movie when you arrive.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano also uses a verb between \"ta\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[present perfect]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Present perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Present perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ta mir\u00e1 ya kame con el pel\u00edcula mientras ta esper\u00e1 con vosotros.\n|We are already watching the movie while waiting for you.\n|}\n\n====Passive and active voice====\n\nTo form the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano active voice, Zamboangue\u00f1os follow the pattern:\n\n'''El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal'''\nThe soldiers killed the criminal.\n\nAs illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer ''el maga soldao'' before the verb phrase ''ya mata'' and then the object ''el criminal'' as indicated by the particle ''con''\n\nTraditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o does not have a passive construction of its own.<ref>Chabacano de Zamboanga Handbook</ref>\n\n==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==\n\nChabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:\n\n:\"En denantes\" which means 'a while ago' (Spanish: \"hace un tiempo\"). Take note that \"En denantes\" is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as \"hace poco tiempo\" or \"hace un tiempo\", but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.\n\n:\"Masquen\"/\"Masquin\" means 'even (if)' or 'although'. In Spanish, \"mas que\" is an archaic Spanish phrase meaning 'although', nowadays replaced by the Spanish word \"aunque\".<ref>Brooks 1933, Vol. 16, 1st Ed.</ref>\n\n:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called \"castellano\". Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangue\u00f1os, call the language as \"castellano\" implying the original notion as the language of Castille while \"espa\u00f1ol\" is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.\n\n:The pronoun \"vos\" is alive in Chavacano. While \"vos\" was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English \"thou\"), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of [[Cervantes]] and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America \u2013 (the [[voseo]]) or, incidentally, as with English \"thou\" vs. \"you\".\n\n:\"Ansina\" means 'like that' or 'that way'. In modern Spanish, \"as\u00ed\" is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word \"ansina\" can still be heard among the aged in [[Mexico]] and is the only way of expressing this meaning in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].\n\nOn the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become [[false friends]]. Some examples of false friends are:\n\n:\"Siguro\"/\"Seguro\" means 'maybe'. In Spanish, \"seguro\" means 'sure', 'secure', or 'stable', although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, \"Seguramente vendr\u00e1\" (Probably he will come).\n\n:\"Siempre\" means 'of course'. In Spanish, \"siempre\" means 'always'.\n\n:\"Firmi\" means 'always'. In Spanish, \"firme\" means 'firm' or 'steady'.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Filipino language]]\n*[[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n*[[List of loanwords in Tagalog]]\n*[[Chavacano Wikipedia]]\n\n==Codes==\n:[[ISO 639-1]]: ''none''\n:[[ISO 639-2]]: '''crp'''<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n:[[ISO 639-3]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\"/>\n:[[SIL code]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\">SIL International</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=John|title=M\u00e1s que, mas que and mas \u00a1qu\u00e9!|journal=Hispania|volume=16|issue=1|pages=23\u201334|issn=00182133|doi=10.2307/332588|date=1 January 1933|jstor=332588}}\n*Castillo, Edwin Gabriel Ma., S.J. \"Glosario Liturgico: Liturgical Literacy in the Chavacano de Zamboanga\",(Unpublished) Archdiocese of Zamboanga.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Chambers |editor1-first=John, S.J. |editor2-last=Wee |editor2-first=Salvador, S.J. |title=English-Chabacano Dictionary |date=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press}}\n*Holm, J.

The variety spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/cbk|title=Chavacano|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-11-16|language=en}}</ref> Chavacano is the only Spanish-based [[Creole language|creole]] in [[Asia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zamboanga.com/history/history_chabacano_versus_related_creoles.htm|title=The Early History of Chavacano de Zamboanga: Chabacano versus related creoles|website=www.zamboanga.com|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref>\n\nThe different varieties of Chavacano differ in certain aspects like vocabulary but they are generally [[mutually intelligible]] by speakers of these varieties, especially between neighboring varieties. While a majority of the lexicon of the different Chavacano varieties derive from [[Spanish language|Spanish]], their grammatical structures are generally similar to other [[Philippine languages]]. Among [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], it is the only one that is not an [[Austronesian language]], but like [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]], it uses [[reduplication]].\n\nThe word ''{{wiktes|chabacano|Chabacano}}'' is derived from Spanish, roughly meaning \"poor taste\" or \"vulgar\", though the term itself carries no negative connotations to contemporary speakers and has lost its original Spanish meaning.\n\n== Distribution and variants ==\n\n===Varieties===\n[[Image:Map chavacano.gif|thumb|right|190px|Native Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers in Mindanao]]\n\nLinguists have identified at least six Spanish Creole varieties in the Philippines. Their classification is based on their [[substratum|substrate languages]] and the regions where they are commonly spoken. The three known varieties of Chavacano with [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] as their substrate language are the [[Luzon]]-based creoles of which are '''Cavite\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Cavite City]]), '''Bahra''' or '''Ternate\u00f1o''' (spoken in [[Ternate, Cavite]]) and '''Ermite\u00f1o''' (once spoken in the old district of [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] in [[Manila]] and is now extinct).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Variety\n! style=\"width:13%;\"| Places\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Native speakers\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Zamboangue\u00f1o (Zamboangue\u00f1o/Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano/Chabacano de Zamboanga)'''||'''[[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], [[Sulu]], [[Tawi-Tawi]], [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]],''' || 359,000 (Rubino 2008, citing 2000 census)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\">Ethnologue</ref>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cavite\u00f1o (Chabacano di Nisos/Chabacano de Cavite)'''||'''[[Cavite]]'''|| 4,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Cotabate\u00f1o (Chabacano de Cotabato)'''||'''[[Cotabato City]], [[Maguindanao]]'''|| Dead\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Castellano Abakay (Chabacano Davaoe\u00f1o)'''||'''[[Davao Region]],''' '''[[Davao City]]'''|| Extinct \n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ternate\u00f1o (Bahra)'''||'''[[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]]'''|| 3,000 (2013)<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|'''Ermite\u00f1o (Ermitense)'''||'''[[Ermita]]'''|| Extinct\n|}\n\nThere are a number of theories on how these different varieties of Chavacano have evolved and how they are related to one another. According to some linguists, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is believed to have been influenced by Cavite\u00f1o Chabacano as evidenced by prominent [[Zamboangue\u00f1o]] families who descended from Spanish Army officers (from [[Spain]] and [[Latin America]]), primarily Cavite\u00f1o mestizos, stationed at [[Fort Pilar]] in the 19th century. When Cavite\u00f1o officers recruited workers and technicians from [[Iloilo]] to man their [[sugar]] plantations and [[rice]] fields to reduce the local population's dependence on the Donativo de Zamboanga, the Spanish colonial government levied taxes on the islanders to support the fort's operations. With the subsequent migration of Ilonggo traders to Zamboanga, the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano was infused with Hiligaynon words as the previous migrant community was assimilated.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205215037/http://www.zamboanga.org/chavacano/chabacano_by_ben_saavedra.htm|title=Mensajes Y Noticias|date=2005-02-05|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nMost of what appears to be [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] words in Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano are actually Hiligaynon. Although Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano's contact with Cebuano began much earlier when Cebuano soldiers were stationed at Fort Pilar during the Spanish colonial period, it was not until closer to the middle of the 20th century that borrowings from Cebuano accelerated from more migration from the Visayas as well as the current migration from other Visayan-speaking areas of the Zamboanga Peninsula.\n\n'''Zamboangue\u00f1o''' (Chavacano) is spoken in [[Zamboanga City]], [[Basilan]], parts of [[Sulu]] and [[Tawi-Tawi]], and [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]] and [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano is the most dynamically spoken language of Philippine Creole Spanish. It is used as a lingua franca between both Muslim and Christians in the Southwestern Mindanao and Basilan Islands communities. Its influence has spread to other islands in the west, such as the Jolo Islands, as well as to Cotabato and Davao in Mindanao, and finally down south to Malaysia.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2005-06-01|title=The Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages and the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, In Retrospect|journal=Creole Language in Creole Literatures|volume=20|issue=1|pages=167\u2013174|doi=10.1075/jpcl.20.1.09gil|issn=0920-9034}}</ref> The other varieties of Chavacano with [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as their primary substrate language are the [[Mindanao]]-based creoles of which are '''Castellano Abakay''' or '''Chavacano Davaoe\u00f1o''' (now extinct but was spoken in some areas of [[Davao City|Davao]]), influenced by [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and divided into two varieties, ''Castellano Abakay Chino'' and ''Castellano Abakay Jap\u00f3n'', and '''Cotabate\u00f1o''' (no longer spoken in [[Cotabato City]]). Both Cotabate\u00f1o and Davaoe\u00f1o are very similar to Zamboangue\u00f1o.\n\n===Characteristics===\nThe Chavacano languages in the Philippines are creoles based on [[Mexican Spanish]] and possibly, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. In some Chavacano languages, most words are common with [[Andalusian Spanish]], but there are many words borrowed from [[Nahuatl]], a language native to Central Mexico, which aren\u2019t found in Andalusian Spanish. Although the vocabulary is largely Mexican, its grammar is mostly based on other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]], primarily [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]. By way of Spanish, its vocabulary also has influences from the Native American languages [[Nahuatl]], [[Taino]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], etc. as can be evidenced by the words chongo (monkey, instead of Spanish '{{wiktspa|mono}}'), tiange (mini markets), etc.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nIn contrast with the Luzon-based dialects, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has the most borrowings and/or influence from other Philippine [[Austronesian languages]] including [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Words of [[Malay language|Malay]] origin are present in the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety; the latter is included because although not local in Philippines, it was the lingua franca of [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. As the Zamboangue\u00f1o variety is also spoken by Muslims, the variety has some [[Arabic language|Arabic]] loanwords, most commonly [[Glossary of Islam|Islamic terms]].{{specify|date=February 2018}}{{dubious|date=February 2018}} In spite of this, it\u2019s difficult to trace whether these words have their origin in the local population or in Spanish itself, given that Spanish has about 6,000 words of Arabic origin. Chavacano also contains loanwords of [[Persian language|Persian]] origin which enter Chavacano via Malay and Arabic; both Persian and Spanish are [[Indo-European languages]].\n\n===Demographics===\nThe highest number of Chavacano speakers are found in '''[[Zamboanga City]]''' and in the island province of [[Basilan]]. A significant number of Chavacano speakers are found in Cavite City and Ternate. There are also speakers in some areas in the provinces of [[Zamboanga del Sur]], [[Zamboanga Sibugay]], [[Zamboanga del Norte]], Davao, and in Cotabato City. According to the official 2000 Philippine census, there were altogether 607,200 Chavacano speakers in the Philippines in that same year. The exact figure could be higher as the 2000 population of Zamboanga City, whose main language is Chavacano, far exceeded that census figure. Also, the figure doesn\u2019t include Chavacano speakers of the [[Overseas Filipino|Filipino diaspora]]. All the same, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the variety with the most number of speakers, being the official language of Zamboanga City whose population is now believed to be over a million; is also an official language in Basilan.\n\nChavacano speakers are also found in [[Semporna]] and elsewhere in Sabah as Sabah was under partial Spanish sovereignty and via Filipino refugees who escaped from [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] and predominantly Muslim areas of Mindanao like [[Sulu Archipelago]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Susanne Michaelis|title=Roots of Creole Structures: Weighing the Contribution of Substrates and Superstrates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPUeQLcGMOMC|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-5255-6}}</ref>\n\nA small number of Zamboanga's indigenous peoples and of Basilan, such as the [[Taus\u016bg people|Tausug]]s, the [[Samal people|Samals]], and the [[Yakan]]s, majority of those people are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], also speak the language. In the close provinces of Sulu and [[Tawi-Tawi]] areas, there are Muslim speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', all of them are neighbors of Christians. Speakers of the ''Chavacano de Zamboanga'', both Christians and Muslims, also live in [[Lanao del Norte]] and [[Lanao del Sur]]. Christians and Muslims in [[Maguindanao]], [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], [[Cotabato City]], and [[Saranggani]] speak ''Chavacano de Zamboanga''. Take note that [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-tawi, [[Maguindanao]], [[Cotabato City]], [[Soccsksargen]] (region that composed of [[Sultan Kudarat]], [[Cotabato]], [[South Cotabato]], and [[Saranggani]]) and Davao Region became part of short-lived [[Republic of Zamboanga]], which chose Chavacano as [[official language]].\n\n===Social significance===\nChavacano has been primarily and practically a spoken language. In the past, its use in literature was limited and chiefly local to the geographical location where the particular variety of the language was spoken. Its use as a spoken language far exceeds its use in literary work in comparison to the use of Spanish in the Philippines which was more successful as a written language than a spoken language. In recent years, there have been efforts to encourage the use of Chavacano as a written language, but the attempts were mostly minor attempts in folklore and religious literature and few pieces of written materials by the print media. In Zamboanga City, while the language is used by the mass media, the Catholic Church, education, and the local government, there have been few literary work written in Zamboangue\u00f1o and access to these resources by the general public isn\u2019t readily available; Bibles of Protestant Christians are also written in standard Chavacano. As Chavacano is spoken by Muslims as second language not only in Zamboanga City and Basilan but even in Sulu and Tawi-tawi, a number of [[Qur'an]] books are published in Chavacano.\n\nThe Zamboangue\u00f1o variety has been constantly evolving especially during half of the past century until the present. Zamboangue\u00f1o has been experiencing an infusion of English and more Tagalog words and from other languages worldwide in its vocabulary and there have been debates and discussions among older Chavacano speakers, new generation of Chavacano speakers, scholars, linguists, sociologists, historians, and educators regarding its preservation, cultivation, standardization, and its future as a Spanish-based creole. In 2000, The [[Instituto Cervantes]] in Manila hosted a conference entitled \"Shedding Light on the Chavacano Language\" at the [[Ateneo de Manila University]]. Starting school year 2012\u201313, the Zamboangue\u00f1o variant has also been taught at schools following the implementation of the Department of Education's policy of Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE). It serves as a medium of instruction from kindergarten to grade 3 and as a separate subject (Mother Tongue) from grades 1 to 3.\n\nBecause of the grammatical structures, Castilian usage, and archaic Spanish words and phrases that Chavacano (especially Zamboangue\u00f1o) uses, between speakers of both contemporary Spanish and Chavacano who are uninitiated, both languages appear to be non-intelligible to a large extent. For the initiated speakers, Chavacano can be intelligible to some Spanish speakers, and while most Spanish words can easily be understood by Chavacano speakers, many would struggle to understand a complete Spanish sentence.\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term '''Chavacano''' or '''Chabacano''' originated from the Spanish word ''{{wiktspa|chabacano}}'' which literally means \"poor taste\", \"vulgar\", \"common\", \"of low quality\", or \"coarse\". Chavacano has since evolved into a word of its own in different spellings with no negative connotation, but to simply being the name of the language itself.\n\nDuring the Spanish colonial period, what is today called ''Chavacano'' was also called by the Spanish-speaking population as the \"''lenguaje de la calle''\", \"''lenguaje de parian''\" (language of the street), or \"''lenguaje de cocina''\" (kitchen Spanish) to refer to the Chabacano spoken by the people of Manila, particularly in Ermita) to distinguish it from the Spanish language spoken by those of the upper class, which consisted of Spaniards and educated Natives.\n\nLinguists use the term '''Philippine Creole Spanish''' which can be further divided into two geographic classifications: Manila Bay Creoles (which includes Ternate\u00f1o and Cavite\u00f1o) and Mindanao Creole (including Zamboangue\u00f1o). The varieties of the language are geographically related. The Manila Bay Creoles have Tagalog as their substrate language while The Mindanao Creoles have [[Visayan languages|Visayan]] (mostly [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]]), [[Subanon language|Subanon]], and [[Sama language|Sama]] as their substrate language(s). \n\nChavacano/Chabacano speakers themselves have different preferences on whether to spell the language with a V or a B.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Noun phrases in Creole languages : a multi-faceted approach|date=2007|publisher=J. Benjamins Pub. Co|others=Baptista, Marlyse., Gu\u00e9ron, Jacqueline.|isbn=9789027291820|location=Amsterdam|oclc=233632814}}</ref> They emphasise the difference between their variety and others using their own geographical location as a point of reference. Language speakers in Ternate also use the term Bahra to refer to their language and their city. Chavacano varieties usually have their area name attached to the language.\n\nIn Zamboanga City, most people are using the V in spelling the language as Chavacano. In the three-day Chavacano Orthography Congress held on Nov 19-21, 2014, wherein it included the presentation by researchers on Chavacano, mostly results from surveys conducted among selected respondents in the city, the newly organized Chavacano Orthography Council met with the officials of the Department of Education and agreed among others that the language is to be spelled with the V. Most people in support of this move would like to distance their language Chavacano to the word Chabacano which also means \u2018vulgar\u201d in Spanish.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Chavacano/Chabacano varieties and alternative names\n!Location\n!Geographical area\n!Alternative names and spellings\n|-\n|Zamboanga\n|Mindanao\n|Chavacano, Zamboangue\u00f1o, Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n|-\n|Cavite\n|Manila Bay\n|Chabacano de Cavite, Cavite\u00f1, Caviten, Linguaje de Niso\n|-\n|Basilan\n|Mindanao\n|Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano de Zamboanga\n|-\n|Cotabato\n|Mindanao\n|Cotabate\u00f1, Cotabato Chavacano\n|-\n|Davao\n|Mindanao\n|Davaoe\u00f1o, Davaoe\u00f1o Zamboangue\u00f1o, Castellano Abakay, Davao Chavacano\n|-\n|Ermita\n|Manila Bay\n|Ermitense, Ermita Chabacano\n|-\n|Ternate\n|Manila Bay\n|Ternate\u00f1o, Ternate\u00f1o Chabacano, Bahra, Linguaje di Bahra\n|}\n\n==Historical background==\n\nThere is no definite conclusion on the precise history of how these different varieties of Chavacano developed.\n\nPrior to the formation of what is today the Philippines, what existed were a collection of various islands and different [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnolinguistic group]]s inhabiting them. The [[Spanish Colonisation of the Philippines|Spanish colonisation]] of the Philippine islands had led to the presence of the Spanish language in the islands. Though Spanish was the language of the government, the various languages originating and found in the islands remained the mother tongue of the various inhabitants. Instead of using Spanish to spread Christianity, Spanish missionaries preferred to learn the various local languages. With over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, the Spanish language came to influence the various Philippine languages to varying degrees by way of aspects like new loanwords and expressions.\n\nCreole languages (such as [[French-based creole]]s) have formed at various points in time around the world due to colonialism. As a result of contact between speakers of two mutually non-intelligible languages, creole languages have evolved in some cases to facilitate communication. This usually involves taking the vocabulary of another language and grammatical features of the native language. In contrast to the numerous French-based creole languages, only three creole languages have been found to be Spanish-based or heavily influenced: [[Papiamento]], [[Palenquero]], and Chavacano. In the Philippines, a major difficulty in tracing the development of Chabacano is the confusion attributed to in accounts of travelers to the Philippines between a coherent creole language, `broken Spanish', and fluent Spanish.<ref>Lipski, J. M. Chabacano/Spanish and the Philippine linguistic identity.</ref> The earliest believed attestation of a coherent creole language spoken in Cavite City comes from the Augustinian priest Mart\u00ednez de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga who in his 1803 accounts of his travels in the Philippines, ''Estadismos de las Islas Filipinas'', notes that \"In Cavite and in its suburb of San Roque, a very corrupted Spanish is spoken, whose phraseology is entirely taken from the language of the country\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Mentions of a vernacular referred to as \"kitchen Spanish\" and \"language of the market\" (referring to the Manila variety), or other terms are found in a number of texts of the 19th century. However, the kind of vernacular referred to by these terms are imprecise and these terms may refer to a fully fledged creole or to a Spanish-pidgin spoken by Chinese and Filipino merchants.\n\nThe manner of formation of this type of speech found in a number of communities around the Philippines remains unclear today. A sample of what is today called ''Chabacano'' may be found in dialogues contained in chapters 18 (''Supercher\u00edas'') and 28 (''Tatakut'') of Filipino writer [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]]'s 1891 work ''[[El Filibusterismo]]''.<ref>text reproduced by [https://filipinoscribbles.wordpress.com/2011/09/08/chabacano-in-el-filibusterismo/ Filipino Scribbles]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.angelfire.com/art2/roger_santos/rizal.html | title=Chabacano - Cavite's Dialect}}</ref> The dialogue found in chapter 18 is:\n\n{{quote|''\u00bfPorque ba no di pod\u00ed nis\u00f3s entr\u00e1?'' preguntaba una voz de mujer.\n\n\u2015''Ab\u00e1, \u00f1ora, porque \u2018tall\u00e1 el man\u00e1 prailes y el man\u00e1 empleau'', contest\u00f3 un hombre; ''\u2018ta jas\u00ed solo para il\u00f3s el cabesa de espinge''.\n\n\u2015''\u00a1Curioso tambi\u00e9n el man\u00e1 prailes!'' dijo la voz de mujer alej\u00e1ndose; ''\u00a1no quiere pa que di sab\u00e9 nisos cuando ilos ta sali inga\u00f1au! \u00a1Cosa! \u00a1Querida be de praile el cabesa!''}}\n\nIn the 1883 work of German linguist [[Hugo Schuchardt]] ''Uber das Malaiospanische der Philippinen'', he presents fragments of texts and comments of what he calls \"Malayo-Spanish\". However, the first to give a general study and investigation of the varieties of Chavacano as a group was by Keith Whinnom in his 1956 work ''The Spanish Contact Vernaculars in the Philippine Islands ''. Whinnom gives an overall view of the history and grammar of what he calls \"Ermita\u00f1o\" of Ermita in Manila, \"Cavite\u00f1o\" of Cavite and \"Zamboangue\u00f1o\" of Zamboanga. In it, he also postulated his [[Monogenetic theory of pidgins|monogenetic theory]] on the origin of these vernaculars.\n\nLinguists are unsettled on how these vernaculars formed and how they connect to one another, if any. There are many theories but the two main theories of the origin of Chavacano are: Whinnom's \"monogenetic theory\" and a \"parallel-development\" theory proposed by Frake in 1971.\n\n===Monogenetic theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nAccording to the Monogentic theory or one-way theory advanced by Whinnom, all varieties of Chavacano result from a single source and that varieties are related to each other.\n\n===Parallel-development theory===\n{{expand section|date=February 2018}}\nThe parallel development theory or two-way theory as advocated by Frake in 1971, the variants found in Luzon and Mindanao had evolved autonomously from each other.\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\nOn 23 June 1635, [[Zamboanga City]] became a permanent foothold of the Spanish government with the construction of the [[Fort Pilar|San Jos\u00e9 Fortress]]. Bombardment and harassment from pirates and raiders of the sultans of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]] and the determination to spread Christianity further south (as Zamboanga was a crucial strategic location) of the Philippines forced the Spanish missionary friars to request reinforcements from the colonial government.\n\nThe military authorities decided to import labour from Luzon and the Visayas. Thus, the construction workforce eventually consisted of Spanish, Mexican and Peruvian soldiers, masons from Cavite (who comprised the majority), sacadas from Cebu and Iloilo, and those from the various local tribes of Zamboanga like the Samals and Subanons.\n\nLanguage differences made it difficult for one ethnic group to communicate with another. To add to this, work instructions were issued in Spanish. The majority of the workers were unschooled and therefore did not understand Spanish but needed to communicate with each other and the Spaniards. A [[pidgin]] developed and became a full-fledged [[creole language]] still in use today as a [[lingua franca]] and/or as [[official language]], mainly in [[Zamboanga City]].\n\nWhen the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] gave up its territories in [[Sulu Archipelago]] to Spain within late 1700s (Sulu Sultanate gave up Basilan to Spain in 1762, while Sulu and Tawi-tawi were not given up by sultanate because the Sulu Sultanate only recognised partial Spanish sovereignty to Sulu and Tawi-tawi), Spanish settlers and soldiers brought the language to the region until Spain, [[Germany]], and [[United Kingdom]] signed an agreement named the [[Madrid Protocol of 1885]] that recognised Spanish rule of Sulu Archipelago. Chavacano becomes a lingua franca of Sulu Archipelago (composing of Sulu, Tawi-tawi, Basilan); although North Borneo (now Sabah) is not included on the [[Spanish East Indies]] area as stated on the Protocol and control by the [[United Kingdom]], Chavacano has still a little impact in Semporna.\n\nFrom then on, constant Spanish military reinforcements as well as increased presence of Spanish religious and educational institutions have fostered the Spanish creole.\n\n===Cavite\u00f1o / Ternate\u00f1o{{anchor|Cavite\u00f1o}}===\nThe [[Merdicas]] (also spelled Mardicas or Mardikas) were [[Catholic]] natives of the islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] of the [[Moluccas]] in the vicinity of [[New Guinea]], converted during the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] occupation of the islands by [[Jesuit]] missionaries. The islands were later captured by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] who vied for their control with the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]]. In 1663, the Spanish garrison in Ternate were forced to pull out to defend [[Manila]] against an impending invasion by the Chinese pirate [[Koxinga]] (sacrificing the Moluccas to the Dutch in doing so). A number of Merdicas volunteered to help, eventually being resettled in a sandbar near the mouth of the [[Maragondon]] river (known as the ''Barra de Maragondon'') and [[Tanza, Cavite]], Manila.<ref name=\"lipski\">{{cite book|author=John.

The Merdicas community eventually integrated into the local population. Today, the place is called [[Ternate, Cavite|Ternate]] after the island of Ternate in the Moluccas, and the descendants of the Merdicas continue to use their Spanish creole (with Portuguese influence) which came to be known as Cavite\u00f1o or Ternate\u00f1o Chavacano.<ref name=\"lipski\"/>\n\n==Samples==\n\n===Zamboangue\u00f1o===\n\n;Donde tu hay anda?\n:Spanish: \u00bfA d\u00f3nde vas?\n: (\u2018Where are you going?\u2019)\n;Ya mir\u00e1 yo con Jos\u00e9.\n:Spanish: Yo vi a Jos\u00e9.\n: (\u2018I saw Jos\u00e9.\u2019)\n;Ya empez\u00e1 ele busc\u00e1 que busc\u00e1 entero lugar con el sal.\n:Spanish: El/Ella empez\u00f3 a buscar la sal en todas partes.\n: (\u2018He/She began to search everywhere for the salt.\u2019)\n;Ya and\u00e1 ele na escuela.\n:Spanish: El/Ella se fue a la escuela.\n: (\u2018He/She went to school.\u2019)\n;Si Mario ya dorm\u00ed na casa.\n:Spanish: Mario durmi\u00f3 en la casa.\n: (\u2018Mario slept in the house.\u2019)\n;El hombre, con quien ya man encuentro tu, es mi hermano.\n:Spanish: El hombre que encontraste, es mi hermano.\n:(The man [whom] you met is my brother.)\n;El persona con quien tu tan cuento, bien alegre gayot.\n:Spanish: La persona con la que est\u00e1s hablando es muy alegre. / La persona con quien t\u00fa est\u00e1s conversando es bien alegre.\n: (The person you are talking to is very happy indeed.)\n:\n\n====Another sample of Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano\n!Spanish\n!English\n|-\n|Treinta y cuatro kilometro desde el pueblo de Zamboanga el Bunguiao, un diutay barrio que estaba un desierto.

Broadly speaking, the formal register is closer to Spanish, and the colloquial register to the local Austronesian languages.\n\nIn the common, colloquial, vulgar or familiar register/sociolect, words of local origin or a mixture of local and Spanish words predominate. The common or familiar register is used ordinarily when conversing with people of equal or lower status in society. It is also used more commonly in the family, with friends and acquaintances. Its use is of general acceptance and usage.\n\nIn the formal register/sociolect, words of Spanish origin or Spanish words predominate. The formal register is used especially when conversing with people of higher status in society. It is also used when conversing with elders (especially in the family and with older relatives) and those in authority. It is more commonly used by older generations, by Zamboangue\u00f1o mestizos, and in the barrios. It is the form used in speeches, education, media, and writing. The formal register used in conversation is sometimes mixed with some degree of colloquial register.\n\nThe following examples show a contrast between the usage of formal words and common or familiar words in Chavacano:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English\n!Chavacano (formal)\n!Chavacano (common/colloquial/vulgar/familiar)\n!Spanish\n|-\n|slippery\n|resbalozo/resbaladizo\n|malandug\n|resbaloso/resbaladizo\n|-\n|rice\n|morisqueta\n|kanon/arroz\n|morisqueta (understood as a Filipino rice dish)/arroz\n|-\n|rain\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|aguacero/ulan\n|lluvia/aguacero\n|-\n|dish\n|vianda/comida\n|comida/ulam\n|vianda/comida\n|-\n|braggart/boastful\n|orgulloso(a)\n|bugalon(a)/ hambuguero(a)\n|orgulloso(a)\n|-\n|car\n|coche\n|auto\n|auto/coche\n|-\n|housemaid\n|muchacho (m)/muchacha (f)\n|ayudanta (female); ayudante (male)\n|muchacha(o)/ayudante\n|-\n|father\n|pap\u00e1 (tata)\n|p\u00e1pang (tata)\n|pap\u00e1 (padre)\n|-\n|mother\n|mam\u00e1 (nana)\n|m\u00e1mang (nana)\n|mam\u00e1 (madre)\n|-\n|grandfather\n|abuelo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|abuelo/lolo\n|-\n|grandmother\n|abuela\n|abuela/lola\n|abuela/lela\n|-\n|small\n|chico(a)/peque\u00f1o(a)\n|peque\u00f1o(a)/diutay\n|peque\u00f1o/chico\n|-\n|nuisance\n|fastidio\n|asarante / salawayun\n|fastidio\n|-\n|hard-headed\n|testarudo\n|duro cabeza/duro pulso\n|testarudo/cabeza dura\n|-\n|slippers\n|chancla\n|chinelas\n|chancla/chinelas\n|-\n|married\n|de estado/de estao\n|casado/casao\n|casado\n|-\n|(my) parents\n|(mis) padres\n|(mi) tata'y nana\n|(mis) padres\n|-\n|naughty\n|travieso(a)\n|guachi / guachinanggo(a)\n|travieso(a)\n|-\n|slide\n|rezbalasa/deslizar\n|landug\n|resbalar/deslizar\n|-\n|ugly\n|feo (masculine)/fea (feminine)\n|malacara, malacuka\n|feo(a)\n|-\n|rainshower\n|lluve\n|tal\u00edtih\n|lluvia\n|-\n|lightning\n|rayo\n|rayo/quirlat\n|rayo\n|-\n|thunder/thunderstorm\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|trueno\n|-\n|tornado\n|tornado/remolino, remulleno\n|ipo-ipo\n|tornado/remolino\n|-\n|thin (person)\n|delgado(a)/flaco(a)/chiquito(a)\n|flaco/flaquit\n|delgado/flaco/flaquito\n|}\n\n==Writing system==\n{{contradiction|Are there 29 or 30 letters--is <rr> a letter?|date=January 2016}}\n\nChavacano is written using the [[Latin script]]. As Chavacano has mostly been a [[spoken language]] than a written one, multiple ways of writing the different varieties of Chavacano exist. Most published Chavacano texts utilize spelling systems nearly identical to Spanish, adjusting certain spellings of words to reflect how they are pronounced by native Chavacano speakers. Since the propagation of the usage of the [[Filipino language]] in education and the media as the national language, Filipino's orthography has affected how certain persons might spell Chavacano, especially since recent generations have grown unfamiliar with Spanish orthography; Most published works, and the general media, however more often retain Spanish-based spelling systems.\n\nThe kind of writing system used to write Chavacano may differ according to the writer of the text. Writing may be written using a Spanish-derived writing system, where all words (including words of local origin) are spelled adhering to basic Spanish orthographic rules; it may also be written \"phonetically\", similar to the modern orthography of Filipino; another writing style uses a mixture of the two, spelling words based on an etymological approach, using phonetic spelling for words of Filipino origin and Spanish spelling rules for words of Spanish origin.\n\nin Zamboanga, an etymological-based approach was formally recently endorsed by the local city government and this is the system used in public schools as part of the mother-tongue policy of the Department of Education for kindergarten to grade 3. In principle, words of Spanish origin are to be spelled using Spanish rules while Chavacano words of local origin are spelled in the manner according to their origin. Thus, the letter ''k'' appear mostly in words of [[Austronesian]] origin or in loanwords from other Philippine languages (words such as ''kame'', ''kita'', ''kanamon'', ''kaninyo'').\n<!--Unsourced:\nSome additional characters like the ''\u00f1'' (''e\u00f1e'', representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, a letter distinct from ''n'' but typographically composed of an ''n'' with a [[tilde]]), the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''ch'' ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}), the ''ll'' ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}}), and the [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] ''rr'' ({{lang|es|erre}} with strong ''r'') exist in Chavacano.-->\n\nIt is uncommon in modern written works to include the [[acute accent]] and the [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] in writing except in linguistic or highly formalized texts. Also, the letters ''\u00f1'' and ''ll'' are sometimes replaced by ''ny'' and ''ly'' in informal texts.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nThe Chavacano alphabet has 30 letters, including <ch>, <ll>, <\u00f1> and <rr>:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Languages of the Southern Gateway: Chavacano, Sinama, Tausug, Yakan|last=Department of Education, Culture and Sports and The Summer Institute of Linguistics|publisher=The Summer Institute of Linguistics|year=1979|isbn=978-9711801311|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=}}</ref>\n\n'''a''', '''b''', '''c''', '''ch''', '''d''', '''e''', '''f''', '''g''', '''h''', '''i''', '''j''', '''k''', '''l''', '''ll''', '''m''', '''n''', '''\u00f1''', '''o''', '''p''', '''q''', '''r''', '''rr''', '''s''', '''t''', '''u''', '''v''', '''w''', '''x''', '''y''', '''z'''\n\n====Letters and letter names====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | A a || style=\"width: 17em;\" | '''a''' {{IPA|/a/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | J j || style=\"width: 20em;\" | '''jota''' {{IPA|/\u02c8xota/}}\n| style=\"width:2.5em;\" | R r || style=\"width: 25em;\" | '''ere''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u027ee/}}\n|-\n| B b || '''be''' {{IPA|/be/}}<br>\n| K k || '''ka''' {{IPA|/ka/}}\n| Rr rr || '''erre''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ere/}}\n|-\n| C c || '''ce'''  {{IPA|/se/}}\n| L l || '''ele''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ele/}}\n| S s || '''ese''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ese/}}\n|-\n| Ch ch || '''che''' {{IPA|/t\u0283e/}}\n| Ll ll || '''elle''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u028ee/}}\n| T t || '''te''' {{IPA|/te/}}\n|-\n| D d || '''de''' {{IPA|/de/}}\n| M m || '''eme''' {{IPA|/\u02c8eme/}}\n| U u || '''u''' {{IPA|/u/}}\n|-\n| E e || '''e''' {{IPA|/e/}}\n| N n || '''ene''' {{IPA|/ene/}}\n| V v || '''uve''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ube/}}\n|-\n| F f || '''efe''' {{IPA|/\u02c8efe/}}\n| \u00d1 \u00f1 || '''e\u00f1e''' {{IPA|/\u02c8e\u0272e/}}\n| W w || '''doble u''' {{IPA|/\u02c8uve doble/}}<br>\n|-\n| G g || '''ge''' {{IPA|/xe/}}\n| O o || '''o''' {{IPA|/o/}}\n| X x || '''equis''' {{IPA|/\u02c8ekis/}}\n|-\n| H h || '''hache''' {{IPA|/\u02c8at\u0283e/}}\n| P p || '''pe''' {{IPA|/pe/}}\n| Y y || '''ye''' {{IPA|/\u025f\u029de/}}<br>\n|-\n| I i || '''i''' {{IPA|/i/}}<br>\n| Q q || '''cu''' {{IPA|/ku/}}\n| Z z || '''zeta''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seta/}}<br>'''zeda''' {{IPA|/\u02c8seda/}}\n|}\n\nOther letter combinations include ''rr'' (erre), which is pronounced {{IPA|/xr/}} or {{IPA|/r/}}, and ''ng,'' which is pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}. Another combination was ''\u00f1g,'' which was pronounced {{IPA|/\u014b/}} but is now obsolete and is only written as ''ng''.\n\nSome sounds are not represented in the Chavacano written language. These sounds are mostly in words of Philippine and foreign origin. Furthermore, the pronunciation of some words of Spanish origin have become distorted or Philippinized in modern Chavacano. Some vowels have become allophonized ('e' and 'o' becomes 'i' and 'u' in some words) and some consonants have changed their pronunciation. (i.e. ''escoger'' became ''iscuj\u00ed'' in informal speech; ''tiene'' {{IPA|/t\u0283\u025bn\u025b/}}; ''Dios'' {{IPA|/d\u0292\u0254s/}}; ''Castilla'' became {{IPA|/kastilla/}} instead of {{IPA|/kasti\u028ea/}}).\n\nGlottal stops, as in Filipino languages, are not also indicated (\u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb). These sounds are mainly found in words of Philippine origin and are only indicated in dictionaries (i.e. jend\u00ea = not; ol\u00ea = again) and when they are, the circumflex accent is used.\n\nOther pronunciation changes in some words of Spanish origin include:\n\n: f ~ {{IPA|/p/}}\n: j, g (before 'e' and 'i') ~ /{{IPA|h}}/ (in common with dialects of [[Caribbean Spanish|Caribbean]] and other areas of [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|southern Spain]])\n: ch ~ {{IPA|/ts/}}\n: rr ~ {{IPA|/xr/}}\n: di, de ~ {{IPA|/d\u0292/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: Dios ~ /jos/ ; dejalo ~ /jalo/)\n: ti, te ~ {{IPA|/t\u0283/}} (when followed or preceded by other vowels: tierra ~ /chehra/; tiene ~ /chene/)\n: ci, si ~ {{IPA|/\u0283/}}  (when followed or preceded by other vowels: conciencia ~ /kon\u0283en\u0283a/)\n\n[b, d, g] between vowels which are [[fricatives|fricative]] [[allophones]] are pronounced as they are in Chavacano.\n\n===Other sounds===\n\n: -h {{IPA|/h/}} (glottal fricative in the final position); sometimes not written\n: -g {{IPA|/k/}}; sometimes written as just -k\n: -d {{IPA|/t/}}; sometimes written as just -t\n: -kh [{{IPA link|x}}]; only in loanwords of Arabic origin, mostly Islamic terms\n\n===Sounds from English===\n\n: \u201cv\u201d pronounced as English \u201cv\u201d (like: vase) (vi)\n: \u201cz\u201d pronounced as English \u201cz\u201d (like: zebra)  (zi)\n: \u201cx\u201d pronounced as English \u201cx\u201d (like: X-ray)  (ex/eks)\n: \u201ch\u201d like: house (/eitsh/); sometimes written as 'j'\n\n===Diphthongs===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Letters\n!Pronunciation\n!Example\n!Significant\n|-\n|'''ae'''\n| aye\n| ca\u00e9\n| fall, to fall\n|-\n|'''ai'''\n| ay\n| caido\n| fallen, fell\n|-\n|'''ao'''\n| aow\n| cuidao\n| take care, cared\n|-\n|'''ea'''\n| eya\n| pat\u00e9a\n| kick, to kick\n|-\n|'''ei'''\n| ey\n| re\u00ed\n| laugh\n|-\n|'''eo'''\n| eyo\n| v\u00eddeo\n| video\n|-\n|'''ia'''\n| ya\n| advertencia\n| warning, notice\n|-\n|'''ie'''\n| ye\n| cien(to)\n| one hundred, hundred\n|-\n|'''io'''\n| yo\n| canci\u00f3n\n| song\n|-\n|'''iu'''\n| yu\n| saci\u00fat\n| to move the hips a little\n|-\n|'''uo'''\n| ow\n| institutuo\n| institute\n|-\n|'''qu'''\n| ke\n| qu\u00e9, que\n| what, that, than\n|-\n|'''gu'''\n| strong g\n| gu\u00eda\n| to guide, guide\n|-\n|'''ua'''\n| wa\n| agua\n| water\n|-\n|'''ue'''\n| we\n| cuento\n| story\n|-\n|'''ui'''\n| wi\n| cuid\u00e1\n| care, to take care\n|-\n|'''oi'''\n| oy\n| o\u00ed\n| hear, to hear\n|}\n\n==Grammar==\n\n===Simple sentence structure (verb\u2013subject\u2013object word order)===\n\nChavacano is a language with the [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] sentence order. This is because it follows the Hiligaynon or Tagalog grammatical structures. However, the [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] order does exist in Chavacano but only for emphasis purposes (see below). New generations have been slowly and vigorously using the S-V-O pattern mainly because of the influence of the English language. These recent practices have been most prevalent and evident in the mass media particularly among Chavacano newswriters who translate news leads from English or Tagalog to Chavacano where the \"who\" is emphasized more than the \"what\". Because the mass media represent \"legitimacy\", it is understood by Chavacano speakers (particularly Zamboangue\u00f1os) that the S-V-O sentence structure used by Chavacano journalists is standardized.\n\n====Declarative affirmative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nChavacano generally follows the simple verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure typical of Hiligaynon or Tagalog in declarative affirmative sentences:\n\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) ang mga manogbaligya (subject) sang duta (object).\n::Hiligaynon: Nagabakal (verb) sang duta (object) ang mga manogbaligya (subject).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ang mga negosyante (subject) ng lupa (object).\n::Tagalog: Bumibili (verb) ng lupa (object) ang mga negosyante (subject).\n:::(\u2018The businessmen are buying land.\u2019)\n\nThe subject always appears after the verb, and in cases where pronominal subjects (such as personal pronouns) are used in sentences, they will never occur before the verb:\n\n:'''Ya and\u00e1 yo na iglesia enantes'''.\n::(\u2018I went to church a while ago.\u2019)\n\n====Declarative negative sentences in the simple present, past, and future tenses====\n\nWhen the predicate of the sentence is negated, Chavacano uses the words '''jendeh''' (from Tagalog \u2019hindi\u2019 or Hiligaynon 'indi' which means \u2019no\u2019; the Cebuano uses 'dili', which shows its remoteness from Chavacano as compared to Hiligaynon) to negate the verb in the present tense, '''no hay''' (which literally means \u2019none\u2019) to negate the verb that was supposed to happen in the past, and '''jend\u00eah''' or '''nunca''' (which means \u2019no\u2019 or \u2019never\u2019) to negate the verb that will not or will never happen in the future respectively. This manner of negating the predicate always happens in the verb\u2013subject\u2013object or verb\u2013object\u2013subject sentence structure:\n\nPresent Tense\n\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject) '''con el tierra''' (object).\n:'''Jend\u00eah ta compr\u00e1''' (verb) '''tierra''' (object) '''el maga/mana negociante''' (subject).\n::(Eng: The businessmen are not buying land.

Span: el hombre de negocio nunca comprar\u00e1 terreno)\n\n===Nouns and articles===\n\nThe Chavacano definite article '''el''' precedes a singular noun or a plural marker (for a plural noun). The indefinite article '''un''' stays constant for gender as 'una' has almost completely disappeared in Chavacano, except for some phrases like \"una vez\". It also stays constant for number as for singular nouns. In Chavacano, it is quite common for '''el''' and '''un''' to appear together before a singular noun, the former to denote certainty and the latter to denote number:\n\n:'''el caj\u00f3n''' (\u2019the box\u2019) \u2013 '''el maga/mana caj\u00f3n(es)''' (\u2019the boxes\u2019)\n:'''un soltero''' (\u2019a bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''un soltera''' (\u2019a spinster\u2019)\n:'''el un soltero''' (\u2019the bachelor\u2019) \u2013 '''el un soltera''' (\u2019the spinster\u2019)\n\nNouns in Chavacano are not always preceded by articles. Without an article, a noun is a generic reference:\n\n:'''Jendeh yo ta llor\u00e1 lagrimas sino sangre'''.\n::(\u2019I do not cry tears but blood\u2019.)\n:'''Ta carg\u00e1 yo palo'''.\n::(\u2019I am carrying wood\u2019).\n\nProper names of persons are preceded by the definite article '''si''' or the phrase '''un tal''' functioning as an indefinite article would:\n\n:'''Un bonita candidata si Maria.'''.\n::(\u2019Maria is a beautiful candidate\u2019.)\n:'''un tal Juancho'''\n::(\u2019a certain Juancho\u2019)\n\n====Singular nouns====\n\nUnlike in Spanish, Chavacano [[nouns]] derived from Spanish do not follow gender rules in general. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, the [[article (grammar)|article]] 'el' basically precedes every singular noun. However, this rule is not rigid (especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o) because the formal vocabulary mode wherein Spanish words predominate almost always is the preferred mode especially in writing. The Spanish article 'la' for feminine singular nouns does exist in Chavacano, though it occurs rarely and mostly in the formal medium of writing, such as poems and lyrics. When accompanying a Spanish feminine noun, the 'la' as the article is more tolerated than acceptable.  Among the few exceptions where the 'la' occurs is as a formal prefix when addressing the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps more as an emphasis of her importance in Christian devotion. But the real article is still the 'el', which makes this use of a \"double article\" quite unique. Thus it is common to hear the Blessed Virgin addressed in Chavacano as 'el La Virgen Maria' (the \"L\" of the 'la' capitalized to signify its permanent position within the noun compound). In general, though, when in doubt, the article 'el' is always safe to use. Compare:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (general and common)\n!Chavacano singular noun (accepted or uncommon)\n|-\n|the virgin\n|el virgen\n|la virgen (accepted)\n|-\n|the peace\n|el paz\n|la paz (accepted)\n|-\n|the sea\n|el mar\n|la mar (accepted)\n|-\n|the cat\n|el gato\n|el gato (la gata is uncommon)\n|-\n|the sun\n|el sol\n|el sol\n|-\n|the moon\n|el luna\n|el luna (la luna is uncommon)\n|-\n|the view\n|el vista\n|la vista (accepted)\n|-\n|the tragedy\n|el tragedia\n|el tragedia (la tragedia is uncommon)\n|-\n|the doctor\n|el doctor\n|el doctora (la doctora is uncommon)\n|}\n\nAnd just like Spanish, Chavacano nouns can have gender but only when referring to persons. However, they are always masculine in the sense (Spanish context) that they are generally preceded by the article 'el'. Places and things are almost always masculine. The -o is dropped in masculine nouns and -a is added to make the noun feminine:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English singular noun\n!Chavacano singular noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano singular noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teacher\n|el maestro\n|el maestra\n|-\n|the witch\n|el burujo\n|el buruja\n|-\n|the engineer\n|el engeniero\n|el engeniera\n|-\n|the tailor/seamstress\n|el sastrero\n|el sastrera\n|-\n|the baby\n|el ni\u00f1o\n|el ni\u00f1a\n|-\n|the priest/nun\n|el padre / sacerdote\n|el madre / monja\n|-\n|the grandson/granddaughter\n|el nieto\n|el nieta\n|-\n|the professor\n|el profesor\n|el profesora\n|-\n|the councilor\n|el consejal\n|el consejala\n|}\n\nNot all nouns referring to persons can become feminine nouns. In Chavacano, some names of persons are masculine (because of the preceding article 'el' in Spanish context) but do not end in -o.\n\n:Examples: '''el alcalde''', '''el capitan''', '''el negociante''', '''el ayudante''', '''el chufer'''\n\nAll names of animals are always masculine\u2014in Spanish context\u2014preceded by the article 'el'.\n\n:Examples: '''el gato''' (gata is uncommon), '''el puerco''' (puerca is uncommon), '''el perro''' (perra is uncommon)\n\nNames of places and things can be either masculine or feminine, but they are considered masculine in the Spanish context because the article 'el' always precedes the noun:\n\n:'''el cocina''', '''el pantal\u00f3n''', '''el comida''', '''el camino''', '''el trapo''', '''el ventana''', '''el mar'''\n\n====Plural nouns====\n\nIn Chavacano, plural nouns (whether masculine or feminine in Spanish context) are preceded by the retained singular masculine Spanish article 'el'. The Spanish articles 'los' and 'las' have almost disappeared. They have been replaced by the modifier (a plural marker) 'maga/mana' which precedes the singular form of the noun. Maga comes from the native Hiligaynon 'maga' or the Tagalog 'mga'. The formation of the Chavacano plural form of the noun (el + maga/mana + singular noun form) applies whether in common, familiar or formal mode. It may be thought of as roughly equivalent to saying in English, \"the many (noun)\" instead of \"the (noun)s\", and in fact \"the many (noun)s\" is used more in [[Philippine English]] than elsewhere.\n\nThere are some Chavacano speakers (especially older Cavite\u00f1o or Zamboangue\u00f1o speakers) who would tend to say 'mana' for 'maga'. 'Mana' is accepted and quite common, especially among older speakers, but when in doubt, the modifier 'maga' to pluralize nouns is safer to use.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English plural noun\n!Chavacano plural noun (masculine)\n!Chavacano plural noun (feminine)\n|-\n|the teachers\n|el maga/mana maestro(s)\n|el maga/mana maestra(s)\n|-\n|the witches\n|el maga/mana burujo(s)\n|el maga/mana buruja(s)\n|-\n|the engineers\n|el maga/mana engeniero(s)\n|el maga/mana engeniera(s)\n|-\n|the tailors/seamstresses\n|el maga/mana sastrero(s)\n|el maga/mana sastrera(s)\n|-\n|the babies\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1o(s)\n|el maga/mana ni\u00f1a(s)\n|-\n|the priests/nuns\n|el maga/mana padre(s)\n|el maga/mana madre(s)\n|-\n|the grandsons/granddaughters\n|el maga/mana nieto(s)\n|el maga/mana nieta(s)\n|-\n|the professors\n|el maga/mana professor(es)\n|el maga/mana profesora(s)\n|-\n|the councilors\n|el maga/mana consejal(es)\n|el maga/mana consejala(s)\n|}\n\nAgain, this rule is not rigid (especially in the Zamboangue\u00f1o formal mode). The articles 'los' or 'las' do exist sometimes before nouns that are pluralized in the Spanish manner, and their use is quite accepted:\n\n:'''los caballeros''', '''los dias''', '''las noches''', '''los chavacanos''', '''los santos''', '''las ma\u00f1anas''', '''las almujadas''', '''las mesas''', '''las plumas''', '''las cosas'''\n\nWhen in doubt, it is always safe to use 'el' and 'maga or mana' to pluralize singular nouns:\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballero(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s)''', '''el maga/mana noche(s)''', '''el maga/mana chavacano(s)''', '''el maga/mana santo(s)''', '''el maga/mana d\u00eda(s) que viene''' (this is a phrase; 'el maga/mana ma\u00f1ana' is uncommon), '''el maga/mana almujada(s)''', '''el maga/mana mesa(s)''', '''el maga/mana pluma(s)'''\n\nIn Chavacano, it is common for some nouns to become doubled when pluralized (called ''[[Reduplication]]'', a characteristic of the Malayo-Polynesian family of languages):\n\n:'''el maga cosa-cosa''' (el maga cosa/s is common), '''el maga casa casa''' (el maga casa is common), '''el maga gente gente''' (el maga gente is common), '''el maga juego juego''' (el maga juego is common)\n\nBut note that in some cases, this \"reduplication\" signifies a difference in meaning.  For example,  'el maga bata' means 'the children' but 'el maga bata-bata' means one's followers or subordinates, as is a gang or mob.\n\nIn general, the suffixes -s, -as, -os to pluralize nouns in Spanish have also almost disappeared in Chavacano. However, the formation of plural nouns with suffixes ending in -s, -as, and -os are accepted. Basically, the singular form of the noun is retained, and it becomes plural because of the preceding modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga/mana caballeros''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana caballero''' (correct)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00edas''' (accepted)\n:'''el maga/mana d\u00eda''' (correct)\n\nAdding the suffix -es to some nouns is quite common and accepted. Nouns ending in -cion can also be pluralized by adding the suffix -es:\n\n:'''el maga meses''', '''el maga mujeres''', '''el maga mayores''', '''el maga tentaciones''', '''el maga contestaciones''', '''el maga naciones''', '''el maga organizaciones'''\n\nHowever, it is safer to use the general rule (when in doubt) of retaining the singular form of the noun preceded by the modifier/plural marker 'maga' or 'mana':\n\n:'''el maga mes''', '''el maga mujer''', '''el maga mayor''', '''el maga tentaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga contestaci\u00f3n''', '''el maga naci\u00f3n''', '''el maga organizaci\u00f3n'''\n\n===Pronouns===\n\nChavacano pronouns are based on Spanish and native sources; many of the pronouns are not used in either but may be derived in part.\n\nIn contrast to the other varieties of Chavacano, the variety spoken in Zamboanga uses more pronouns derived from a native Philippine language (I.e. Hiligaynon) in addition to Spanish. In Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three different levels of usage for certain pronouns depending on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the addressee, the status of both in family and society, or the mood of the speaker and addressee at the particular moment: ''common'', ''familiar'', and ''formal''. The common forms are, particularly in the second and third person plural, derived from Cebuano while most familiar and formal forms are from Spanish. The ''common forms'' are used to address a person below or of equal social or family status or to someone is who is acquainted. The common forms are used to regard no formality or courtesy in conversation. Its use can also mean rudeness, impoliteness or offensiveness. The ''familiar forms'' are used to address someone of equal social or family status. It indicates courteousness, and is commonly used in public conversations, the broadcast media, and in education. The ''formal forms'' are used to address someone older and/or higher in social or family status. It is the form used in writing.\n\nAdditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o is the only variety of Chavacano which distinguishes between the [[inclusive and exclusive we|inclusive we]] (''kita'') \u2013 including the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 and the [[inclusive and exclusive we|exclusive we]] (''kame'') \u2013 excluding the person spoken to (the addressee) \u2013 in the first person plural except in the formal form where ''nosotros'' is used for both.\n\n====Personal (nominative/subjective case) pronouns====\n\nBelow is a table comparing the personal pronouns in three varieties of Chavacano.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Cavite\u00f1\n!Bahra\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|yo\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | yo\n|yo (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nako (Chino)\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|[e]vo[s] (common)/(informal)<br>t\u00fa (familiar)<br>usted (formal)\n|vo/bo<br>tu<br>ust\u00e9\n|vo/bo<br>ust\u00e9\n|usted\nvos\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|\u00e9l<br>ele\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" | eli\n|\u00e9l\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|kam\u00e9 (exclusive/common/familiar)<br>kit\u00e1 (inclusive/common/familiar)<br>nosotros (formal)\n|nisos\n|mijotro<br>mihotro<br>motro\n|nosotros (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|kam\u00f3 (common)<br> vosotros (familiar)<br> ustedes (formal)\n|vusos<br>busos\n|buhotro<br>bujotro<br>ustedi<br>tedi\n|ustedes\nvosotros\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|sil\u00e1 (common/familiar)<br>ellos (formal)\n|ilos\n|lojotro<br>lohotro<br>lotro\n|ellos\n|}\n\n====Possessive pronouns (Chavacano de Zamboanga, Castellano Abakay)====\n\nThe usage modes also exist in the possessive pronouns especially in Zamboangue\u00f1o. ''Amon'', ''Aton'', ''ila'' and ''inyo'' are obviously of [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] but not [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] origins, and when used as pronouns, they are of either the common or familiar mode. The inclusive and exclusive characteristics peculiar to Zamboangue\u00f1o appear again in the 1st person plural. Below is a table of the possessive pronouns in the Chavacano de Zamboanga:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp;\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o\n!Castellano Abakay (de Davao)\n|-\n|'''1st person singular'''\n|mi<br>m\u00edo<br>de mi<br>de m\u00edo<br>di mio/di m\u00edo\n|mi\nm\u00edo\n|-\n|'''2nd person singular'''\n|de vos (''common'')<br>de tu (''familiar'')<br>tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de tuyo/di tuyo (''familiar'')<br>de usted (''formal'')\n|de tu\n|-\n|'''3rd person singular'''\n|su<br>suyo<br>de su<br>de suyo/di suyo\n|ese (Chino, Jap\u00f3n)\nde iya (Chino)\n|-\n|'''1st person plural'''\n|de am\u00f3n/diamon (''common/familiar'') (exclusive)<br>de at\u00f3n/diaton (''common/familiar'') (inclusive)<br>nuestro (''formal'')<br>de/di nuestro (''formal'')\n|nuestro\n|-\n|'''2nd person plural'''\n|de i\u00f1o/di inyo (''common'')<br>de vosotros (''familiar'')<br>de ustedes (''formal'')\n|vos\n|-\n|'''3rd person plural'''\n|de ila (''common/familiar'')<br>de ellos/di ellos (''formal'')\n|de ellos\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, Chavacano verbs are mostly Spanish in origin. In contrast with the other varieties, there is rarely a Zamboangue\u00f1o verb that is based on or has its origin from other Philippine languages. Hence, verbs contribute much of the Spanish vocabulary in Chavacano de Zamboanga.\n\nGenerally, the simple form of the Zamboangue\u00f1o verb is based upon the infinitive of the Spanish verb, minus the final /r/. For example, ''continuar'', ''hablar'', ''poner'', ''recibir'', and ''llevar'' become ''continu\u00e1'', ''habl\u00e1'', ''pon\u00e9'', ''recib\u00ed'', and ''llev\u00e1'' with the accent called \"acento agudo\" on the final syllable.\n\nThere are some rare exceptions. Some verbs are not derived from infinitives but from words that are technically Spanish phrases or from other Spanish verbs. For example, ''dar'' (give) does not become 'da' but ''dale'' (give) (literally in Spanish, to \"give it\" [verb phrase]). In this case, ''dale'' has nothing to do with the Spanish infinitive ''dar''. The Chavacano ''brinca'' (to hop) is from Spanish ''brincar'' which means the same thing.\n\n====Verb tenses - simple tenses====\n\nChavacano of Zamboangue\u00f1o uses the words ''ya'' (from Spanish ''ya'' [already]), ''ta'' (from Spanish ''est\u00e1'' [is]), and ''ay'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|ay cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|ay beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|ay dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|ay ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nCavite\u00f1 uses the words ''ya'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Cavite\u00f1 infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|ya cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|ya beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|ya dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|ya ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\n\nWhile Bahra uses the words ''a'', ''ta'', and ''di'' plus the simple form of the verb to convey the basic tenses of [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Bahra ininitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cant\u00e1\n|a cant\u00e1\n|ta cant\u00e1\n|di cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beb\u00e9\n|a beb\u00e9\n|ta beb\u00e9\n|di beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dorm\u00ed\n|a dorm\u00ed\n|ta dorm\u00ed\n|di dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|ped\u00ed\n|a ped\u00ed\n|ta ped\u00ed\n|di ped\u00ed\n|}\nUnlike in the Zamboangue\u00f1o, Cavite\u00f1, and Bahra, Castellano Abakay (Davaoe\u00f1o) doesn't have the ''ya'' and ''ta'' prefix. The infinitives and their conjugations are somehow retained, and there are some that have simplified conjugations:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!English infinitive\n!Spanish infinitive\n!Castellano Abakay infinitive\n!Past tense\n!Present tense\n!Future tense\n|-\n|to sing\n|cantar\n|cantar\n|cant\u00f3\n|canta\n|cant\u00e1\n|-\n|to drink\n|beber\n|beber\n|bib\u00edo\n|bebe\n|beb\u00e9\n|-\n|to sleep\n|dormir\n|dormir\n|durmi\u00f3\n|duerme\n|dorm\u00ed\n|-\n|to ask (of something)\n|pedir\n|pedir\n|pidi\u00f3\n|pide\n|ped\u00ed\n|}\n\n=====Perfect constructions=====\n\nIn Zamboangue\u00f1o, there are three ways to express that the verb is in the [[present perfect]]. First, ''ya'' can appear both before and after the main verb to express that in the present perspective, the action has already been completed somewhere in the past with the accent falling on the final ''ya''. Second, ''ta'' and ''ya'' can appear before and after the verb respectively to express that the action was expected to happen in the past (but did not happen), is still expected to happen in the present, and actually the expectation has been met (the verb occurs in the present). And third, a verb between ''ta'' and ''pa'' means an action started in the past and still continues in the present:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o past perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o present perfect\n!Zamboangue\u00f1o future perfect\n|-\n|ya cant\u00e1 ya.\n|ta cant\u00e1 pa. / ta canta ya.\n|ay cant\u00e1 ya.\n|-\n|ya beb\u00e9 ya.\n|ta beb\u00e9 pa. / ta Bebe ya.\n|ay beb\u00e9 ya.\n|-\n|ya dorm\u00ed ya.\n|ta dorm\u00ed pa. / ta dormi ya.\n|ay dorm\u00ed ya.\n|-\n|ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ya ped\u00ed pa. / ya ped\u00ed ya.\n|ay ped\u00ed ya.\n|}\n\nThe [[past perfect]] exists in Zamboangue\u00f1o. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can be used between two sentences in the simple past form to show which verb came first. The words ''antes'' (before) and ''despues'' (after) can also be used between a sentence in the present perfect using ''ya'' + verb + ''ya'' and another sentence in the simple past tense:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 kame el pel\u00edcula antes de ya compr\u00e1 con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie before we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Past perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Past perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ya mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula despu\u00e9s ya compr\u00e1 kame con el maga chichir\u00edas.\n|We had watched the movie and then we bought the snacks.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano uses a verb between \"hay\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[future perfect]] and [[past perfect]] respectively:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Future perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Future perfect (English)\n|-\n|Hay mir\u00e1 ya kame el pel\u00edcula si hay lleg\u00e1 vosotros.\n|We will have watched the movie when you arrive.\n|}\n\nZamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano also uses a verb between \"ta\" and \"ya\" to denote the [[present perfect]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Present perfect (Zamboangue\u00f1o)\n!Present perfect (English)\n|-\n|Ta mir\u00e1 ya kame con el pel\u00edcula mientras ta esper\u00e1 con vosotros.\n|We are already watching the movie while waiting for you.\n|}\n\n====Passive and active voice====\n\nTo form the Zamboangue\u00f1o Chavacano active voice, Zamboangue\u00f1os follow the pattern:\n\n'''El maga soldao ya mata con el criminal'''\nThe soldiers killed the criminal.\n\nAs illustrated above, active (causative) voice is formed by placing the doer ''el maga soldao'' before the verb phrase ''ya mata'' and then the object ''el criminal'' as indicated by the particle ''con''\n\nTraditionally, Zamboangue\u00f1o does not have a passive construction of its own.<ref>Chabacano de Zamboanga Handbook</ref>\n\n==Archaic Spanish words and false friends==\n\nChabacano has preserved plenty of archaic Spanish phrases and words in its vocabulary that modern Spanish no longer uses; for example:\n\n:\"En denantes\" which means 'a while ago' (Spanish: \"hace un tiempo\"). Take note that \"En denantes\" is an archaic Spanish phrase. Modern Spanish would express the phrase as \"hace poco tiempo\" or \"hace un tiempo\", but Chabacano still retains this archaic Spanish phrase and many other archaic Spanish words. This word is still being used in some areas of southern Spain.\n\n:\"Masquen\"/\"Masquin\" means 'even (if)' or 'although'. In Spanish, \"mas que\" is an archaic Spanish phrase meaning 'although', nowadays replaced by the Spanish word \"aunque\".<ref>Brooks 1933, Vol. 16, 1st Ed.</ref>\n\n:In Chavacano, the Spanish language is commonly called \"castellano\". Chavacano speakers, especially older Zamboangue\u00f1os, call the language as \"castellano\" implying the original notion as the language of Castille while \"espa\u00f1ol\" is used to mean a Spaniard or a person from Spain.\n\n:The pronoun \"vos\" is alive in Chavacano. While \"vos\" was used in the highest form of respect before the 16th century in classical Spanish and is quite archaic nowadays in modern Spanish (much like the English \"thou\"), in Chavacano it is used at the common level of usage (lower than tu, which is used at the familiar level) in the same manner of [[Cervantes]] and in the same manner as in certain Latin American countries such as Argentina (informally and in contrast with usted, which is used formally). Chavacano followed the development of vos in same manner as in Latin America \u2013 (the [[voseo]]) or, incidentally, as with English \"thou\" vs. \"you\".\n\n:\"Ansina\" means 'like that' or 'that way'. In modern Spanish, \"as\u00ed\" is the evolved form of this archaic word. The word \"ansina\" can still be heard among the aged in [[Mexico]] and is the only way of expressing this meaning in [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]].\n\nOn the other hand, some words from the language spoken in Spain have evolved or have acquired totally different meanings in Chavacano. Hence, for Castillian speakers who would encounter Chavacano speakers, some words familiar to them have become [[false friends]]. Some examples of false friends are:\n\n:\"Siguro\"/\"Seguro\" means 'maybe'. In Spanish, \"seguro\" means 'sure', 'secure', or 'stable', although it could imply probability as well, as in the phrase, \"Seguramente vendr\u00e1\" (Probably he will come).\n\n:\"Siempre\" means 'of course'. In Spanish, \"siempre\" means 'always'.\n\n:\"Firmi\" means 'always'. In Spanish, \"firme\" means 'firm' or 'steady'.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Filipino language]]\n*[[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n*[[List of loanwords in Tagalog]]\n*[[Chavacano Wikipedia]]\n\n==Codes==\n:[[ISO 639-1]]: ''none''\n:[[ISO 639-2]]: '''crp'''<ref name=\"Ethnologue\"/>\n:[[ISO 639-3]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\"/>\n:[[SIL code]]: '''cbk'''<ref name=\"SIL International\">SIL International</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=John|title=M\u00e1s que, mas que and mas \u00a1qu\u00e9!|journal=Hispania|volume=16|issue=1|pages=23\u201334|issn=00182133|doi=10.2307/332588|date=1 January 1933|jstor=332588}}\n*Castillo, Edwin Gabriel Ma., S.J. \"Glosario Liturgico: Liturgical Literacy in the Chavacano de Zamboanga\",(Unpublished) Archdiocese of Zamboanga.\n*{{cite book |editor1-last=Chambers |editor1-first=John, S.J. |editor2-last=Wee |editor2-first=Salvador, S.J. |title=English-Chabacano Dictionary |date=2003 |publisher=Ateneo de Zamboanga University Press}}\n*Holm, J.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]]. For instance, it was noted that \"[[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] norms disparaged ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[Liberal individualism|individualism]] (as when housing is determined by one's ability to pay), also [condemning] wide variations in personal wealth as the West has not.

There are elemental characteristics of the authoritarian socialist economic system that distinguish it from the [[capitalist]] [[market economy]]:\n* The communist party has a concentration of power in representation of the working class. The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

[...] The sale of labour power is abolished and labour necessarily becomes creative. Everyone participates in running their institutions and society as a whole.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience. Nkrumah stressed the importance of government-owned property and resources.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals. [And] an economy cannot be politically tailored to perfection\".<ref name=\"Ader\"/><ref name=\"Wellisz\">Wellisz, Stanislaw (1964).

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998. By comparison, Western Europe grew from a higher base of $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period and reached $17,921 by 1998.<ref name=\"Maddison\">Maddison, Angus (2001).

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1981).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\" /> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

This view distinguished Bordiga from Marxist\u2013Leninists, who tended and still tend to telescope the first two stages and so have money and the other exchange categories surviving into socialism, but Bordiga would have none of this.

{"title_page": "Pope Pius XII and China", "text_new": "{{Further|Pope Pius XII}}\n\n'''Pope Pius XII and the Church in China''' involves relations of the [[Holy See]] with [[China]] from 1939-1958. The [[Holy See|Vatican]] recognized [[Chinese rites]] in 1939, elevated the first Chinese cardinal in 1946, and established a Chinese hierarchy.\n\nAs part of its extending domination over Chinese society, in the early 1950s, the government [[Persecution|persecuted]] the Catholic Church and its people, and nearly destroyed it, suppressing the religious freedom of its people. In 1957, it supported the establishment of what it called a patriotic, socialist Chinese Church, which was independent of Rome.\n\n== Chinese rites ==\nFor centuries, the Catholic Church did not recognize the Chinese [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members and tried to suppress these in favor of Catholic dogma. The Chinese revered this as an ancient ritual but the Vatican considered it to be a religious exercise that conflicted with Catholic dogma. As a result, the Church made little progress in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nWithin a year of his election, Pope Pius XII made a dramatic change in policy. At his request, the [[Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith]] issued new instruction on December 8, 1939, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered \"superstitious\" but an honourable way of esteeming one's relatives and therefore permitted to Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 195</ref> The Papal decree changed the ecclesiastical situation in China.

Its constitution from September 1949 guaranteed all vital freedoms, including the freedom of religion, and prohibited discrimination against believers. However, the government was committed to its ideological vision of [[Marxism]], which was very hostile to religion and supported its eradication. The communist party quickly equated religious affiliation as a test of political and ideological loyalty.<ref name=\"contemporary_update\">Lee, Joseph Tse-Hei. \"Christianity in contemporary China: an update\", ''Journal of Church and State'' 49.2 (2007)</ref> It was especially hostile to religious bodies that it saw as outside of its control, as it considered the Catholic Church to be because of its relation to the Vatican and pope.\n\nIn Chinese cities, tolerance was practiced towards the Christian churches; but in rural areas, persecution began in 1950. New laws against counter-revolutionary activities from July 23, 1950, and February 1951 <ref name=\"Giovannetti 232\">Giovannetti 232</ref> created legal tools for going after \"enemies of the people\". The Catholic clergy struggled with increased supervision over their activities. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs in order to earn their living.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Korean War, in which western nations such as the United States played a primary role, foreign missionaries (most of whom were westerners) were accused of being foreign agents, ready to turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref name=\"Giovannetti 232\"/> They were expelled from China and have never been allowed to return. The government confiscated mission properties.<ref name=\"contemporary_update\"/> It refrained from jailing or executing Catholics in large numbers, as it feared an international war with the Western powers. The expulsion of foreign missionaries was intended to symbolize China's liberation from foreign imperialism.\n\nThe 'Preparatory Committee of the Oppose American and Aid Korea Three-Self Reform Movement of the Christian Church' was founded for the purpose of denouncing western missionaries in China.<ref name=\"contemporary_update\"/> All churches were required to demonize foreign missionaries (even ones they had worked with for decades), and Chinese Christians who refused to comply were forced to enroll in political study sessions.<ref name=\"contemporary_update\"/>\n\n[[Y.T. Wu]] in July 1950 led a delegation on behalf of nineteen Protestant churches to meet with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]. They jointly drafted a statement calling for Christian support for the government. Thus, the [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] was created and Christian communities in China severed all ties to foreign groups. YT Wu later became the chairman of the Three-Self organization in 1954. The official policy forbade Chinese religious entities from being under the control of foreign entities.<ref>Marsh, Christopher. \"Revisiting China's 'Great Wall' of separation: religious liberty in China today.\" ''Journal of Church and State'' 50.2 (2008)</ref> This proved especially difficult for Roman Catholics, since the pope was considered such a foreign entity.\n\nThe Catholic Church was considered extremely threatening due to its hierarchical structure, its nationwide networks, and its ability to block government penetration. China demanded Catholics give their full allegiance to the state, superseding allegiance to the Pope; political neutrality was not an option.<ref name=\"contemporary_update\"/>\n\nPope Pius XII replied to these attacks and persecutions in his encyclical ''[[Evangelii praecones]]'', which concerned Catholic missions all over the world but includes his views on the new situation in China:\n\n{{quote|author=Pope Pius XII|title=''Evangelii praecones'', 11, 12|text=In our own time there are countries in the Far East, which are being purpled with martyrs' blood.

Jesus Christ, the first martyr, said: \"If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you.\"}}\n\nIn 1951, the papal nuncio, [[Antonio Riberi|Archbishop Riberi]], was expelled from China. The Chinese government then formed the Three Autonomies Movement, to oversee Catholic leadership, finances and teaching.

He took a flexible stand on financial and organizational autonomy, stating that the Church viewed missionary and financial aid activities always as transitional. The training of domestic institutions and the formation of native clergy was therefore always the priority. At the same time one should not belittle the generosity of other Christians, who finance missionary activities. Foreign priests came in the name of Christ to China, and not as agents of hostile powers.<ref>''Ad Sinarum gentem'', 12-14</ref> Regarding the autonomy to teach, he agreed, it ought to differ according to place and conform, when possible, to the nature and particular character of the Chinese people, and to its ancient traditional customs:\n\n{{Quote|text=Lastly, there are some among you who would wish that your Church would be completely independent, not only, as We have said, in regard to its government and finances, but also in regard to the teaching of Christian doctrine and sacred preaching, in which they try to claim \"autonomy\".

In 1957, it supported the establishment of what it called a patriotic, socialist Chinese Church, which was independent of Rome.\n\n== Chinese rites ==\nFor centuries, the Catholic Church did not recognize the Chinese [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members and tried to suppress these in favor of Catholic dogma. The Chinese revered this as an ancient ritual but the Vatican considered it to be a religious exercise that conflicted with Catholic dogma. As a result, the Church made little progress in China in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nWithin a year of his election, Pope Pius XII made a dramatic change in policy. At his request, the [[Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith]] issued new instruction on December 8, 1939, by which Chinese customs were no longer considered \"superstitious\" but an honourable way of esteeming one's relatives and therefore permitted to Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 195</ref> The Papal decree changed the ecclesiastical situation in China.

Some of those languages have left very little evidence, and their classification is quite uncertain. The [[Punic language]] brought to Sardinia by the [[Carthaginians]] coexisted with the indigenous and non-Italic [[Paleo-Sardinian language|Paleo-Sardinian]], or [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic]].]]\n\nThe '''Italic languages''' form a branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, whose earliest known members were spoken in the [[Italian peninsula]] in the first millennium BC.  The most important of the ancient languages was [[Latin]], the official language of the [[Roman Empire]], which conquered the other Italic peoples before the [[common era]].  The other Italic languages became [[extinct language|extinct]] in the first centuries CE as their speakers were assimilated into the Roman Empire and [[language shift|shifted]] to some form of Latin. Between the third and eighth centuries CE, [[Vulgar Latin]] (perhaps influenced by language-shift from the other Italic languages) diversified into the [[Romance languages]], which are the only Italic languages natively spoken today.     \n\nBesides Latin, the known ancient Italic languages are [[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] (the closest to Latin), [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] and [[Oscan language|Oscan]] (or Osco-Umbrian), and [[South Picene language|South Picene]]. Other Indo-European languages once spoken in the peninsula, whose inclusion in the Italic branch is disputed, are [[Aequian language|Aequian]], [[Vestinian language|Vestinian]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]] and [[Sicel language|Sicel]]. These long-extinct languages are known only from inscriptions in [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds.\n\nIn the first millennium BCE, several (other) non-Italic languages were spoken in the peninsula, including members of other branches of Indo-European (such as [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Greek languages|Greek]]) as well as at least one non-Indo-European one, [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]. \n\nIt is generally believed that those 1st millennium Italic languages descend from Indo-European languages brought by migrants to the peninsula sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE.{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=314\u2013319|1997}}{{Sfn|Bossong|2017|p=859}}{{Sfn|Forston|2004|p=245}} However, the source of those migrations and the history of the languages in the peninsula are still the matter of debate among historians.  In particular, it is debated whether the ancient Italic languages all descended from a single [[Proto-Italic]] language after its arrival in the region, or whether the migrants brought two or more Indo-European languages that were only distantly related.\n\nWith over 800 million native speakers, the Romance languages make Italic the second-most-widely spoken branch of the Indo-European family, after [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]. However, in academia the ancient Italic languages form a separate field of study from the medieval and modern Romance languages. This article focuses on the ancient languages. For the others, see [[Romance studies]].\n\nAll Italic languages (including Romance) are generally written in [[Old Italic scripts]] (or the descendant [[Latin alphabet]] and its adaptations), which descend from the alphabet used to write the non-Italic Etruscan language, and ultimately from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n== History of the concept ==\n{{Indo-European topics|315}}\n[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] have generally concluded that the ancient Indo-European languages of the Italian peninsula, that were not identifiable as belonging to other branches of Indo-European such as Greek, all belonged to a single branch of the family, parallel for example to [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. The founder of this theory is [[Antoine Meillet]] (1866\u20131936).{{Sfn|Villar|2000|pp=474\u2013475}} \n\nThis unitary theory has been criticized by, among others, [[Alois Walde]] (1869\u20131924), [[Vittore Pisani]] (1899\u20131990) and [[Giacomo Devoto]] (1897\u20131974), who proposed that the Latino-Faliscan and Osco-Umbrian languages constituted two distinct branches of Indo-European. This view gained acceptance in the second half of the 1900s,{{Sfn|Villar|2000|pp=447\u2013482}} though proponents such as Rix would later reject the idea, and the unitary theory remains dominant.<ref>Paolo Pocetti, \"The Documentation of Italic\", in ''Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics: An International Handbook'', vol. 2, ed.

The invention quickly spread through the whole peninsula, across language and political barriers.  Local adaptations (mainly minor letter shape changes and the dropping or addition of a few letters) yielded several [[Old Italic alphabets]].\n\nThe inscriptions show that, by 700 BC, many languages were spoken in the region, including members of several branches of Indo-European and several non-Indo-European languages. The most important of the latter was [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], attested by evidence from more than 10,000 inscriptions and some short texts.  No relation has been found between Etruscan and any other known language, and there is still no clue about its possible origin (except for inscriptions on the island of [[Lemnos]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]). Other possibly non-Indo-European languages present at the time were Rhaetian in the [[Alps|Alpine region]], [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] around present-day [[Genoa]], and some unidentified language(s) in [[Sardinia]]. Those languages have left some detectable imprint in Latin.\n\nThe largest language in southern Italy, except [[Ionic Greek]] spoken in the Greek colonies, was [[Messapian language|Messapian]], known due to some 260 inscriptions dating from the 6th and 5th centuries BC. There is a historical connection of Messapian with the [[Illyria]]n tribes, added to the [[archaeology|archaeological]] connection in [[ceramic]]s and [[metal]]s existing between both peoples, which motivated the hypothesis of linguistic connection. But the evidence of Illyrian inscriptions is reduced to personal names and places, which makes it difficult to support such a hypothesis.\n\nIt has also been proposed that the [[Lusitanian language]] may have belonged to the Italic family.{{Sfn|Villar|2000|p=}}<ref>Francisco Villar, Rosa Pedrero y Blanca Mar\u00eda Pr\u00f3sper</ref>\n\n===Timeline of Latin=== world War 2\n\nIn the history of Latin of ancient times, there are several periods:\n*From the archaic period, several inscriptions of the 6th to the 4th centuries BC, fragments of the oldest laws, fragments from the sacral anthem of the [[Salii]], the anthem of the [[Arval Brethren]] were preserved.\n*In the pre-classical period (3rd and 2nd centuries BC), the [[Old Latin|literary Latin language]] (the comedies of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], the [[agriculture|agricultural]] treatise of [[Cato the Elder]], fragments of works by a number of other authors) was based on the dialect of Rome.\n*The period of [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|classical (\"golden\") Latin]] (1st century BC, the development of vocabulary, the development of terminology, the elimination of old morphological doublets, the flowering of [[literature]]: [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Sallust]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]]) was particularly distinguished.\n*During the period of [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|classical (\"silver\") Latin]], the phonetic, morphological and spelling norms were finally formed.\n\nAs the [[Roman Republic]] extended its political dominion over the whole of the Italian peninsula, Latin became dominant over the other Italic languages, which ceased to be spoken perhaps sometime in the 1st century AD. From [[Vulgar Latin]], the Romance languages emerged.\n\nThe Latin language gradually spread beyond Rome, along with the growth of the power of this state, displacing, beginning in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, the languages of other Italic tribes, as well as [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Messapian language|Messapian]] and [[Venetic language|Venetic]], etc. The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of the Italian Peninsula was basically complete by the 1st century BC; except for the [[Southern Italy|south of Italy]] and [[Sicily]], where the dominance of [[Greek language|Greek]] was preserved.\nThe attribution of [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] is controversial.\n\nThe period of [[late Latin]] (2nd to 6th centuries) is characterised by a gap between written and folk-spoken language: the regional differentiation of the people's Latin was accelerated, the formation of Romance languages, finally separated by the 9th century, began on its basis; written Latin continued to be used for a long time in the administrative sphere, [[religion]], [[diplomacy]], trade, school, [[medicine]], [[science]], [[literature]], and remains the language of the [[Catholic Church]] and the official language of the [[Vatican City]].\n\n== Origins ==\n===Prehistory of Italy===\nThe Italian peninsula has been inhabited by tool-making [[hominids]] since at least 730,000 BC, by [[Neanderthal]]s since 120,000 BC, and by anatomically [[modern human]]s since about 35,000 BC.<ref name=Britannica/> \n\nThe [[Pleistocene glaciation]]s caused the human populations of central and northern [[Europe]] to migrate southwards.  At the height of the last [[Ice Age]] (about 35,000 to 13,000 BC), the [[sea level]] was about 120 [[metre|meters]] below its present state, which radically changed the geography of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].<ref name=Britannica>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58256/Romans  |title=history of Europe : Romans |author= |date= |work= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher= |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Agriculture]] reached the peninsula from the [[Middle East]] between 7000 and 6000 BC, marking the start of the [[Neolithic]].  The seminomadic hunter-gathering lifestyle was replaced by a sedentary society, with large fortified villages and an economy based on agriculture and [[animal husbandry]]. While raised primarily as a source of meat, by 3000 BC [[domesticated animal]]s were being exploited for traction (of [[plow]]s and [[cart]]s) and other product such as [[milk]] and [[wool]]. The making of [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] was learned from Greece by about that time.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n[[Metallurgy]] also spread through the Mediterranean at this time, first of [[copper]] around 3000 BC, then [[bronze]] around 2300 BC. Use of the latter for weapons, armor, and other artifacts marks the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]]. Around 700 BC, the development of [[iron]] smelting and [[steelmaking]] marked the beginning of the [[Iron Age]] in the region.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n===Origin theories===\nThe main debate concerning the origin of the Italic languages mirrors that on the origins of the Greek ones,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lepp\u00e4nen|first=Ville|date=2014-01-01|title=Geoffrey Horrocks,Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers (2nd edn.).

The oldest known samples come from Umbrian and Faliscan inscriptions from the 7th century BC. Their [[Old Italic alphabets|alphabets]] were clearly derived from the [[Etruscan alphabet]], which was derived from the [[Western Greek alphabet]] not much earlier than that. There is no reliable information about the languages spoken before that time. Some conjectures can be made based on [[toponym]]s, but they cannot be verified. \n\nThere is no guarantee that the intermediate phases between those old Italic languages and Indo-European will be found. The question of whether Italic originated outside Italy or developed by assimilation of Indo-European and other elements within Italy, approximately on or within its current range there, remains.<ref name=sylvestri325>{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|p=325}}</ref>\n\nAn extreme view of some linguists and historians is that there is no such thing as \"the Italic branch\" of Indo-European. Namely, there never was a unique \"Proto-Italic\", whose diversification resulted in those languages.  Some linguists, like Silvestri<ref>Silvestri, 1987</ref> and Rix,<ref>Rix, 1983, p. 104</ref> further argue that no common Proto-Italic can be reconstructed such that (1) its phonological system may have developed into those of Latin and Osco-Umbrian through consistent phonetic changes, and (2) its phonology and morphology can be consistently derived from those of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. However, Rix later changed his mind and became an outspoken supporter of Italic as a family.\n\nThose linguists propose instead that the ancestors of the 1st millennium Indo-European languages of Italy were two or more different languages, that separately descended from Indo-European in a more remote past, and separately entered Europe, possibly by different routes and/or in different epochs. That view stems in part from the difficulty in identifying a common Italic homeland in prehistory,<ref>{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|pp=322\u2013323}}.</ref> or reconstructing an ancestral \"Common Italic\" or \"Proto-Italic\" language from which those languages could have descended.  Some common features that seem to connect the languages may be just a [[sprachbund]] phenomenon \u2014 a linguistic convergence due to contact over a long period,<ref>Domenico Silvestri, 1993</ref> as in the [[Italo-Celtic]] theory.\n\nBakkum defines Proto-Italic as a \"chronological stage\" without an independent development of its own, but extending over late Proto-Indo-European and the initial stages of Proto-Latin and Proto-Sabellic. Meiser's dates of 4000 BC to 1800 BC, well before Mycenaean Greek, are described by him as \"as good a guess as anyone's\".<ref>{{harvnb|Bakkum|2009|p=54}}.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nGeneral and specific characteristics of the pre-Roman Italic languages:\n\n*in [[phonetics]]: [[Oscan language|Oscan]] (in comparison with [[Latin]] and [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]]) preserved all positions of old diphthongs ai, oi, ei, ou, in the absence of [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], the absence of [[sibilant]]s{{clarify|date=April 2020}}, in the development of kt > ht; a different interpretation of Indo-European kw and gw (Latin qu and v, Osco-Umbrian p and b); in the latter the preservation of s in front of nasal sonants and the reflection of Indo-European *dh and *bh as f; initial stress (in Latin, it was reconstructed in the historical period), which led to [[syncopation]] and the reduction of vowels of unstressed syllables;\n*in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]: 5 declensions and 4 conjugations; reduplication and lengthening of the root vowel; preservation of the locative in Osco-Umbrian; differences in the formation of the future tense, perfect tense and the [[infinitive]]; the use of postpositions in Osco-Umbrian;\n*in the [[syntax]]: many convergences; In Osco-Umbrian, impersonal constructions, [[parataxis]], partitive genitive, temporal genitive and genitive relationships are more often used;\n*in the [[lexicon]]: a significant number of lexemes inherited from Proto-Indo-European; the presence of words unique to the western area of the Indo-European linguistic community; the presence of Osco-Umbrian lexemes, which do not have a correspondence in Latin; borrowing from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], etc., unknown [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of Italy, a large number of borrowings from [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe Italic languages share a certain number of isoglosses and common [[phonological change|phonetic change]]s with respect to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|common Proto-Indo-European]]:\n*Evolution of [[labial consonant|labial stop]]s: *p > p, *b > b, *b\u02b0- > f-, -*b\u02b0- > -b-, (-f-)\n*Evolution of [[alveolar consonant|alveolar stop]]s: *t > t, *d > d. Latin, for example, has *d > l, as in PIE ''*dng\u02b0\u02b7a'' > ''lingua'' or archaic Latin ''*odor'' > ''olor, olere''.\n*Evolution of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated stop]]s at the beginning of a word: *b\u02b0- > f-, -*d\u02b0- > f-.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This form appears for example in the Latin form ''amabo et amabis'' 'I shall love and you shall love' and in the Faliscan form ''cra carefo'' ('tomorrow I will not have', Latin ''cr\u0101s car\u0113bo'').\n\n=== Lexical comparison ===\nAmong the Indo-European languages, the Italic languages share a higher percentage of lexicon with the Celtic and the Germanic ones, three of the four traditional \"[[centum and satem languages|centum]]\" branches of Indo-European (together with Greek).\n\nThe following table shows a lexical comparison of several Italic languages:\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Gloss\n! colspan=4|[[Latino-Faliscan languages|Latino-Faliscan]]\n! colspan=2|[[Osco-Umbrian languages|Osco-Umbrian]]\n! rowspan=2|Proto-<br />Italic\n! rowspan=2|Proto-<br />Celtic\n! rowspan=2|Proto-<br />Germanic\n|-\n!

In phonology, the Italic languages are [[centum and satem languages|centum language]]s by merging the palatals with the velars (Latin ''centum'' has a /k/) but keeping the combined group separate from the labio-velars. In morphology, the Italic languages preserve six cases in the noun and the adjective (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, vocative) with traces of a seventh (locative), but the dual of both the noun and the verb has completely disappeared. From the position of both morphological innovations and uniquely shared lexical items, Italic shows the greatest similarities with Celtic and Germanic, with some of the shared lexical correspondences also being found in Baltic and Slavic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Douglas Q.|first1=Adams|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|date=1997|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=316\u2013317}}</ref>\n\n=== P-Italic and Q-Italic languages ===\nSimilar to [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Celtic languages]], the Italic languages are also divided into P- and Q-branches, depending on the reflex of Proto-Indo-European *''k\u02b7''. In the languages of the Osco-Umbrian branch, *''k\u02b7'' gave ''p'', whereas the languages of the Latino-Faliscan branch preserved it (Latin ''qu'' {{IPA|[k\u02b7]}}).\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|languages}}\n*[[Italo-Celtic]]\n*[[Italic peoples]]\n*[[List of ancient peoples of Italy]]\n*[[Romance languages]]\n*[[Indo-European languages]]\n*[[Languages of Italy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Baldi|first=Philip|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=TVFKDwAAQBAJ|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|date=2017|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-054243-1|editor-last=Klein|editor-first=Jared|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The syntax of Italic|volume=2|ref=harv|editor-last2=Joseph|editor-first2=Brian|editor-last3=Fritz|editor-first3=Matthias}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Bakkum|first=Gabri\u00ebl C.

The most important of the ancient languages was [[Latin]], the official language of the [[Roman Empire]], which conquered the other Italic peoples before the [[common era]].  The other Italic languages became [[extinct language|extinct]] in the first centuries CE as their speakers were assimilated into the Roman Empire and [[language shift|shifted]] to some form of Latin. Between the third and eighth centuries CE, [[Vulgar Latin]] (perhaps influenced by language-shift from the other Italic languages) diversified into the [[Romance languages]], which are the only Italic languages natively spoken today.     \n\nBesides Latin, the known ancient Italic languages are [[Faliscan language|Faliscan]] (the closest to Latin), [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] and [[Oscan language|Oscan]] (or Osco-Umbrian), and [[South Picene language|South Picene]]. Other Indo-European languages once spoken in the peninsula, whose inclusion in the Italic branch is disputed, are [[Aequian language|Aequian]], [[Vestinian language|Vestinian]], [[Venetic language|Venetic]] and [[Sicel language|Sicel]]. These long-extinct languages are known only from inscriptions in [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds.\n\nIn the first millennium BCE, several (other) non-Italic languages were spoken in the peninsula, including members of other branches of Indo-European (such as [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Greek languages|Greek]]) as well as at least one non-Indo-European one, [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]. \n\nIt is generally believed that those 1st millennium Italic languages descend from Indo-European languages brought by migrants to the peninsula sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE.{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|p=314\u2013319|1997}}{{Sfn|Bossong|2017|p=859}}{{Sfn|Forston|2004|p=245}} However, the source of those migrations and the history of the languages in the peninsula are still the matter of debate among historians.  In particular, it is debated whether the ancient Italic languages all descended from a single [[Proto-Italic]] language after its arrival in the region, or whether the migrants brought two or more Indo-European languages that were only distantly related.\n\nWith over 800 million native speakers, the Romance languages make Italic the second-most-widely spoken branch of the Indo-European family, after [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]. However, in academia the ancient Italic languages form a separate field of study from the medieval and modern Romance languages. This article focuses on the ancient languages. For the others, see [[Romance studies]].\n\nAll Italic languages (including Romance) are generally written in [[Old Italic scripts]] (or the descendant [[Latin alphabet]] and its adaptations), which descend from the alphabet used to write the non-Italic Etruscan language, and ultimately from the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\n== History of the concept ==\n{{Indo-European topics|315}}\n[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] have generally concluded that the ancient Indo-European languages of the Italian peninsula, that were not identifiable as belonging to other branches of Indo-European such as Greek, all belonged to a single branch of the family, parallel for example to [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]. The founder of this theory is [[Antoine Meillet]] (1866\u20131936).{{Sfn|Villar|2000|pp=474\u2013475}} \n\nThis unitary theory has been criticized by, among others, [[Alois Walde]] (1869\u20131924), [[Vittore Pisani]] (1899\u20131990) and [[Giacomo Devoto]] (1897\u20131974), who proposed that the Latino-Faliscan and Osco-Umbrian languages constituted two distinct branches of Indo-European. This view gained acceptance in the second half of the 1900s,{{Sfn|Villar|2000|pp=447\u2013482}} though proponents such as Rix would later reject the idea, and the unitary theory remains dominant.<ref>Paolo Pocetti, \"The Documentation of Italic\", in ''Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics: An International Handbook'', vol. 2, ed.

The invention quickly spread through the whole peninsula, across language and political barriers.  Local adaptations (mainly minor letter shape changes and the dropping or addition of a few letters) yielded several [[Old Italic alphabets]].\n\nThe inscriptions show that, by 700 BC, many languages were spoken in the region, including members of several branches of Indo-European and several non-Indo-European languages. The most important of the latter was [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], attested by evidence from more than 10,000 inscriptions and some short texts.  No relation has been found between Etruscan and any other known language, and there is still no clue about its possible origin (except for inscriptions on the island of [[Lemnos]] in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]). Other possibly non-Indo-European languages present at the time were Rhaetian in the [[Alps|Alpine region]], [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] around present-day [[Genoa]], and some unidentified language(s) in [[Sardinia]]. Those languages have left some detectable imprint in Latin.\n\nThe largest language in southern Italy, except [[Ionic Greek]] spoken in the Greek colonies, was [[Messapian language|Messapian]], known due to some 260 inscriptions dating from the 6th and 5th centuries BC. There is a historical connection of Messapian with the [[Illyria]]n tribes, added to the [[archaeology|archaeological]] connection in [[ceramic]]s and [[metal]]s existing between both peoples, which motivated the hypothesis of linguistic connection. But the evidence of Illyrian inscriptions is reduced to personal names and places, which makes it difficult to support such a hypothesis.\n\nIt has also been proposed that the [[Lusitanian language]] may have belonged to the Italic family.{{Sfn|Villar|2000|p=}}<ref>Francisco Villar, Rosa Pedrero y Blanca Mar\u00eda Pr\u00f3sper</ref>\n\n===Timeline of Latin===\nIn the history of Latin of ancient times, there are several periods:\n*From the archaic period, several inscriptions of the 6th to the 4th centuries BC, fragments of the oldest laws, fragments from the sacral anthem of the [[Salii]], the anthem of the [[Arval Brethren]] were preserved.\n*In the pre-classical period (3rd and 2nd centuries BC), the [[Old Latin|literary Latin language]] (the comedies of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], the [[agriculture|agricultural]] treatise of [[Cato the Elder]], fragments of works by a number of other authors) was based on the dialect of Rome.\n*The period of [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|classical (\"golden\") Latin]] (1st century BC, the development of vocabulary, the development of terminology, the elimination of old morphological doublets, the flowering of [[literature]]: [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], [[Sallust]], [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]]) was particularly distinguished.\n*During the period of [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Silver Age|classical (\"silver\") Latin]], the phonetic, morphological and spelling norms were finally formed.\n\nAs the [[Roman Republic]] extended its political dominion over the whole of the Italian peninsula, Latin became dominant over the other Italic languages, which ceased to be spoken perhaps sometime in the 1st century AD. From [[Vulgar Latin]], the Romance languages emerged.\n\nThe Latin language gradually spread beyond Rome, along with the growth of the power of this state, displacing, beginning in the 4th and 3rd centuries BC, the languages of other Italic tribes, as well as [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Messapian language|Messapian]] and [[Venetic language|Venetic]], etc. The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of the Italian Peninsula was basically complete by the 1st century BC; except for the [[Southern Italy|south of Italy]] and [[Sicily]], where the dominance of [[Greek language|Greek]] was preserved.\nThe attribution of [[Ligurian language (ancient)|Ligurian]] is controversial.\n\nThe period of [[late Latin]] (2nd to 6th centuries) is characterised by a gap between written and folk-spoken language: the regional differentiation of the people's Latin was accelerated, the formation of Romance languages, finally separated by the 9th century, began on its basis; written Latin continued to be used for a long time in the administrative sphere, [[religion]], [[diplomacy]], trade, school, [[medicine]], [[science]], [[literature]], and remains the language of the [[Catholic Church]] and the official language of the [[Vatican City]].\n\n== Origins ==\n===Prehistory of Italy===\nThe Italian peninsula has been inhabited by tool-making [[hominids]] since at least 730,000 BC, by [[Neanderthal]]s since 120,000 BC, and by anatomically [[modern human]]s since about 35,000 BC.<ref name=Britannica/> \n\nThe [[Pleistocene glaciation]]s caused the human populations of central and northern [[Europe]] to migrate southwards.

The seminomadic hunter-gathering lifestyle was replaced by a sedentary society, with large fortified villages and an economy based on agriculture and [[animal husbandry]]. While raised primarily as a source of meat, by 3000 BC [[domesticated animal]]s were being exploited for traction (of [[plow]]s and [[cart]]s) and other product such as [[milk]] and [[wool]]. The making of [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] was learned from Greece by about that time.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n[[Metallurgy]] also spread through the Mediterranean at this time, first of [[copper]] around 3000 BC, then [[bronze]] around 2300 BC.

The oldest known samples come from Umbrian and Faliscan inscriptions from the 7th century BC. Their [[Old Italic alphabets|alphabets]] were clearly derived from the [[Etruscan alphabet]], which was derived from the [[Western Greek alphabet]] not much earlier than that. There is no reliable information about the languages spoken before that time. Some conjectures can be made based on [[toponym]]s, but they cannot be verified. \n\nThere is no guarantee that the intermediate phases between those old Italic languages and Indo-European will be found. The question of whether Italic originated outside Italy or developed by assimilation of Indo-European and other elements within Italy, approximately on or within its current range there, remains.<ref name=sylvestri325>{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|p=325}}</ref>\n\nAn extreme view of some linguists and historians is that there is no such thing as \"the Italic branch\" of Indo-European. Namely, there never was a unique \"Proto-Italic\", whose diversification resulted in those languages.  Some linguists, like Silvestri<ref>Silvestri, 1987</ref> and Rix,<ref>Rix, 1983, p. 104</ref> further argue that no common Proto-Italic can be reconstructed such that (1) its phonological system may have developed into those of Latin and Osco-Umbrian through consistent phonetic changes, and (2) its phonology and morphology can be consistently derived from those of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. However, Rix later changed his mind and became an outspoken supporter of Italic as a family.\n\nThose linguists propose instead that the ancestors of the 1st millennium Indo-European languages of Italy were two or more different languages, that separately descended from Indo-European in a more remote past, and separately entered Europe, possibly by different routes and/or in different epochs. That view stems in part from the difficulty in identifying a common Italic homeland in prehistory,<ref>{{harvnb|Silvestri|1998|pp=322\u2013323}}.</ref> or reconstructing an ancestral \"Common Italic\" or \"Proto-Italic\" language from which those languages could have descended.  Some common features that seem to connect the languages may be just a [[sprachbund]] phenomenon \u2014 a linguistic convergence due to contact over a long period,<ref>Domenico Silvestri, 1993</ref> as in the [[Italo-Celtic]] theory.\n\nBakkum defines Proto-Italic as a \"chronological stage\" without an independent development of its own, but extending over late Proto-Indo-European and the initial stages of Proto-Latin and Proto-Sabellic. Meiser's dates of 4000 BC to 1800 BC, well before Mycenaean Greek, are described by him as \"as good a guess as anyone's\".<ref>{{harvnb|Bakkum|2009|p=54}}.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nGeneral and specific characteristics of the pre-Roman Italic languages:\n\n*in [[phonetics]]: [[Oscan language|Oscan]] (in comparison with [[Latin]] and [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]]) preserved all positions of old diphthongs ai, oi, ei, ou, in the absence of [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]], the absence of [[sibilant]]s{{clarify|date=April 2020}}, in the development of kt > ht; a different interpretation of Indo-European kw and gw (Latin qu and v, Osco-Umbrian p and b); in the latter the preservation of s in front of nasal sonants and the reflection of Indo-European *dh and *bh as f; initial stress (in Latin, it was reconstructed in the historical period), which led to [[syncopation]] and the reduction of vowels of unstressed syllables;\n*in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]: 5 declensions and 4 conjugations; reduplication and lengthening of the root vowel; preservation of the locative in Osco-Umbrian; differences in the formation of the future tense, perfect tense and the [[infinitive]]; the use of postpositions in Osco-Umbrian;\n*in the [[syntax]]: many convergences; In Osco-Umbrian, impersonal constructions, [[parataxis]], partitive genitive, temporal genitive and genitive relationships are more often used;\n*in the [[lexicon]]: a significant number of lexemes inherited from Proto-Indo-European; the presence of words unique to the western area of the Indo-European linguistic community; the presence of Osco-Umbrian lexemes, which do not have a correspondence in Latin; borrowing from [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]], etc., unknown [[pre-Indo-European languages]] of Italy, a large number of borrowings from [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe Italic languages share a certain number of isoglosses and common [[phonological change|phonetic change]]s with respect to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|common Proto-Indo-European]]:\n*Evolution of [[labial consonant|labial stop]]s: *p > p, *b > b, *b\u02b0- > f-, -*b\u02b0- > -b-, (-f-)\n*Evolution of [[alveolar consonant|alveolar stop]]s: *t > t, *d > d.

In phonology, the Italic languages are [[centum and satem languages|centum language]]s by merging the palatals with the velars (Latin ''centum'' has a /k/) but keeping the combined group separate from the labio-velars. In morphology, the Italic languages preserve six cases in the noun and the adjective (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, ablative, vocative) with traces of a seventh (locative), but the dual of both the noun and the verb has completely disappeared. From the position of both morphological innovations and uniquely shared lexical items, Italic shows the greatest similarities with Celtic and Germanic, with some of the shared lexical correspondences also being found in Baltic and Slavic.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Douglas Q.|first1=Adams|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|date=1997|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=316\u2013317}}</ref>\n\n=== P-Italic and Q-Italic languages ===\nSimilar to [[P-Celtic and Q-Celtic languages|Celtic languages]], the Italic languages are also divided into P- and Q-branches, depending on the reflex of Proto-Indo-European *''k\u02b7''. In the languages of the Osco-Umbrian branch, *''k\u02b7'' gave ''p'', whereas the languages of the Latino-Faliscan branch preserved it (Latin ''qu'' {{IPA|[k\u02b7]}}).\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|languages}}\n*[[Italo-Celtic]]\n*[[Italic peoples]]\n*[[List of ancient peoples of Italy]]\n*[[Romance languages]]\n*[[Indo-European languages]]\n*[[Languages of Italy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Baldi|first=Philip|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=TVFKDwAAQBAJ|title=Handbook of Comparative and Historical Indo-European Linguistics|date=2017|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=978-3-11-054243-1|editor-last=Klein|editor-first=Jared|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=The syntax of Italic|volume=2|ref=harv|editor-last2=Joseph|editor-first2=Brian|editor-last3=Fritz|editor-first3=Matthias}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Bakkum|first=Gabri\u00ebl C.

A three-time winner of the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Actress|BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress]], she won for ''[[A Cream Cracker under the Settee|Talking Heads: A Cream Cracker Under the Settee]]'' (1988), ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads: Waiting for the Telegram]]'' (1998) and ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'' (1999).

Her father James Henry Hird married her mother Jane Mary Mayor in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112602108:7759&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=112578514:5081&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Marriages Sep 1904|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?scan=1&r=126293033:4164&d=bmd_1554843293|title=FreeBMD Entry Info : Births Sep 1911|website=Freebmd.org.uk|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHer family background was largely theatrical: her mother had been an actress, while her father managed a number of entertainment venues in Morecambe, including the Royalty Theatre where she made her first appearance, and the Central Pier. Thora first appeared on stage at the age of two months in a play her father was managing. She worked at the local [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative store]] before joining the Morecambe Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hird|first=Thora|title=Obituary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/946854.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHird often described her father, who initially did not want her to be an actress, as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedian to his guidance. In 1944 she made her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in the [[Esther McCracken]] play ''[[No Medals]]''.\n\nAlthough Hird left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a \"sand grown 'un\", the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.\n\nInitially, she made regular appearances in films, including the wartime propaganda film ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942, known as ''48 Hours'' in the USA), in which she is shown wielding a rifle to defend a house from [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|German paratroopers]]. She worked with the British film comedian [[Will Hay]] and featured in ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), which starred [[Laurence Olivier]], as well as ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) with [[Alan Bates]] and [[June Ritchie]].\n\nHird gained her highest profile in [[television comedy]], notably the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[Meet the Wife (TV series)|Meet the Wife]]'' (1963\u201366), ''[[In Loving Memory (TV series)|In Loving Memory]]'' (1979\u201386), ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384), and for nearly two decades as Edie Pegden in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' (1986\u20132003). However, she played a variety of roles, including the nurse in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Actress awards for her roles in two of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'' monologues.\n\nShe starred as Captain Emily Ridley in the sitcom ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384) about the [[Salvation Army]], a movement for which she had a soft spot throughout her life. Hird also portrayed Mrs Speck, the housekeeper of the Mayor of [[Gloucester]] in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester (Television Film)|The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' (1989).\n\nIn 1993 she played Annie Longden, mother of [[Deric Longden]] in ''[[Wide-Eyed and Legless]]'' (known as ''The Wedding Gift'' outside the UK) and reprised her role in the 1999 TV film ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'', which won her a [[BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Religious broadcasts==\nHird was a committed Christian, hosting the religious programme ''Praise Be!'', a spin off from ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' on the [[BBC]]. Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill [[stairlift]]s also kept her in the public eye.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Honours==\nShe was created an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1983 Birthday Honours]] and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the [[1993 Birthday Honours]].

Thora first appeared on stage at the age of two months in a play her father was managing. She worked at the local [[The Co-operative Group|Co-operative store]] before joining the Morecambe Repertory Theatre.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hird|first=Thora|title=Obituary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk/946854.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHird often described her father, who initially did not want her to be an actress, as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedian to his guidance. In 1944 she made her [[West End theatre|West End]] debut in the [[Esther McCracken]] play ''[[No Medals]]''.\n\nAlthough Hird left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a \"sand grown 'un\", the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.\n\nInitially, she made regular appearances in films, including the wartime propaganda film ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942, known as ''48 Hours'' in the USA), in which she is shown wielding a rifle to defend a house from [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (Nazi Germany)|German paratroopers]]. She worked with the British film comedian [[Will Hay]] and featured in ''[[The Entertainer (film)|The Entertainer]]'' (1960), which starred [[Laurence Olivier]], as well as ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' (1962) with [[Alan Bates]] and [[June Ritchie]].\n\nHird gained her highest profile in [[television comedy]], notably the [[situation comedy|sitcoms]] ''[[Meet the Wife (TV series)|Meet the Wife]]'' (1963\u201366), ''[[In Loving Memory (TV series)|In Loving Memory]]'' (1979\u201386), ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384), and for nearly two decades as Edie Pegden in ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]'' (1986\u20132003). However, she played a variety of roles, including the nurse in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and won [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Best Actress awards for her roles in two of [[Alan Bennett]]'s ''[[Talking Heads (series)|Talking Heads]]'' monologues.\n\nShe starred as Captain Emily Ridley in the sitcom ''[[Hallelujah! (TV series)|Hallelujah!]]'' (1983\u201384) about the [[Salvation Army]], a movement for which she had a soft spot throughout her life. Hird also portrayed Mrs Speck, the housekeeper of the Mayor of [[Gloucester]] in ''[[The Tailor of Gloucester (Television Film)|The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' (1989).\n\nIn 1993 she played Annie Longden, mother of [[Deric Longden]] in ''[[Wide-Eyed and Legless]]'' (known as ''The Wedding Gift'' outside the UK) and reprised her role in the 1999 TV film ''[[Lost for Words (1999 film)|Lost for Words]]'', which won her a [[BAFTA]] for Best Actress.\n\n==Religious broadcasts==\nHird was a committed Christian, hosting the religious programme ''Praise Be!'', a spin off from ''[[Songs of Praise]]'' on the [[BBC]]. Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill [[stairlift]]s also kept her in the public eye.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Honours==\nShe was created an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1983 Birthday Honours]] and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the [[1993 Birthday Honours]]. She received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters|D.Litt.]] from [[Lancaster University]] in 1989.\n\n==Later Life==\nIn December 1998, using a [[wheelchair]], Hird played a brief but energetic cameo [[role]] as the mother of Dolly on ''[[Dinnerladies (TV series)|Dinnerladies]]'', a sarcastic character who was particularly bitter towards her daughter.\n\nIn mid-December 1999, Hird recorded herself narrating four Alfie story books written and illustrated by [[Shirley Hughes]] for a double-sided [[audio tape]] release, creating memorable voices for every character as well as Alfie himself. \n\nHer final acting work was for [[BBC Radio 7]], recorded and broadcast in 2002: a monologue written for her by Alan Bennett entitled ''The Last of the Sun'', in which she played a forthright, broad-minded woman, immobile in an old people's home but still able to take a stand against the censorious and politically correct attitudes of her own daughter.\n\n==''This Is Your Life''==\nShe was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' on two occasions: in January 1964 when she was surprised by [[Eamonn Andrews]], and in December 1996, when [[Michael Aspel]] surprised her while filming on location for ''[[Last of the Summer Wine]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigredbook.info/thora_hird_1.html |title=Thora Hird |publisher=Bigredbook.info |date= |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life, death and memorial==\nHird had a heart bypass operation in 1992.

It was released on 7 July 1997 in the United Kingdom by [[Creation Records]] and in the United States by [[Reprise Records]]. It peaked at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"UKchart\"/> The album shows inspiration from genres such as [[Dub music|dub]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[dance music]], and [[krautrock]], as well as bands such as [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[the Stooges]]. It was the band's first album to feature [[Gary Mounfield|Gary 'Mani' Mounfield]] on bass, formerly of [[the Stone Roses]], although Marco Nelson played bass on \"Burning Wheel\", \"Star\", \"If They Move, Kill 'Em'\", and \"Stuka\".  Other guest appearances on ''Vanishing Point'' include [[Augustus Pablo]], [[Glen Matlock]], and [[the Memphis Horns]].\n\n==Background==\nGillespie has described the album as an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[speedfreak]] [[Road movie|road-movie]] record.<ref name= \"kessler\"/> It is named after and inspired by the 1971 [[film]] ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'', especially the song \"Kowalski\", which is meant to be an alternative soundtrack of the movie. Lead singer Bobby Gillespie said, \"The music in the film is hippy music, so we thought, 'Why not record some music that really reflects the mood of the film?' It's always been a favourite of the band, we love the air of paranoia and speed- freak righteousness. It's impossible to get hold of now, which is great!

It was released on 7 July 1997 in the United Kingdom by [[Creation Records]] and in the United States by [[Reprise Records]]. It peaked at number 2 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"UKchart\"/> The album shows inspiration from genres such as [[Dub music|dub]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[dance music]], and [[krautrock]], as well as bands such as [[Mot\u00f6rhead]], [[Can (band)|Can]], and [[the Stooges]]. It was the band's first album to feature [[Gary Mounfield|Gary 'Mani' Mounfield]] on bass, formerly of [[the Stone Roses]], although Marco Nelson played bass on \"Burning Wheel\", \"Star\", \"If They Move, Kill 'Em'\", and \"Stuka\".  Other guest appearances on ''Vanishing Point'' include [[Augustus Pablo]], [[Glen Matlock]], and [[the Memphis Horns]].\n\n==Background==\nGillespie has described the album as an [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[speedfreak]] [[Road movie|road-movie]] record.<ref name= \"kessler\"/> It is named after and inspired by the 1971 [[film]] ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]'', especially the song \"Kowalski\", which is meant to be an alternative soundtrack of the movie. Lead singer Bobby Gillespie said, \"The music in the film is hippy music, so we thought, 'Why not record some music that really reflects the mood of the film?' It's always been a favourite of the band, we love the air of paranoia and speed- freak righteousness. It's impossible to get hold of now, which is great! It's a pure underground film, rammed with claustrophobia.\"<ref name= \"kessler\">{{cite news| last = Kessler| first = Ted| coauthors =| title = Vortex, Drug & Rock n Roll| work =| pages =| language =| publisher = [[New Musical Express]]| date = 3 May 1997| url = http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/nme-3may97.html| accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Recording==\nThe album was written and recorded with the aid of two portable eight-track recording studios at the band's Chalk Farm rehearsal rooms.<ref name= \"kessler\"/> The entire album was written and recorded in two months and mixed an additional month.<ref name= \"kessler\"/> On their cover of \"Motorhead\", Gillespie sung the first verse through a [[Darth Vader]] mask.<ref name= \"perry\">{{cite news| last = Perry| first = Andrew| title = Freeze!| publisher = Select| date = June 1997| url = http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/select-june97.html| accessdate = 2007-07-17| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514155208/http://www.theprimalscream.com/press/select-june97.html| archive-date = 14 May 2011| url-status = dead}}</ref> According to an article, much of the album came from live improvisation and, \"Then later on we'd layer other sounds and loops over the top, and the vocals,\" Gillespie said in an interview.<ref name= \"perry\"/> The track \"If They Move, Kill 'Em\" was originally to have included a sample from [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (the song title is one of the earliest lines of dialogue spoken in the film), but it could not be cleared in time.<ref name= \"perry\"/>\n\n==Release==\n''Vanishing Point'' was released on 7 July 1997 in the United Kingdom by [[Creation Records]] and in the United States by [[Reprise Records]]. It is the fifth album by [[Primal Scream]]. \n\nAuthor [[Irvine Welsh]] scripted the video for the album's first single, \"Kowalski,\" which was directed by musician [[Douglas Hart]]. The video features a [[Dodge Challenger]] and super model [[Kate Moss]] beating up the band. Gillespie described the video as a cross between ''[[Faster Pussycat, Kill!

By his mid-teens, he was creating original designs of his own in the flat, two-dimensional style of car catalogs of the time.

During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

In October 1947, with samples of his work in tow, he interviewed successfully and by mid-November of that year, he was working at [[Ford]] as the new assistant head of styling in the Ford studio, working initially in exteriors under the supervision of Adrian Gil Spear. For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Exner had the salesmanship and persuasiveness required to make badly needed changes that would by the mid-1950s bring [[Chrysler]] to the forefront of American automobile design.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Godshall|first=Jeff|date=1975|title=The last DeSoto: Styling by Virgil Exner|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=26|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Now as Director of Styling, Exner set about rebuilding the department, turning it into the talk of the town, not only among Detroit's styling circles but of the entire country. Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

Pietsch, 1955]]\nWorking for [[Raymond Loewy]] and Associates, which at that time was responsible for all [[Studebaker]] styling, was a unique experience. There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Pietsch remembers management complaining about how European styling ruined [[Studebaker]], but it was, in his opinion, all misplaced condemnation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=165}}</ref>\n\nThings were so bad by late 1953 that discussion turned to the idea of teaming up with another car company, and by the following June, with sales for 1954 worse than ever, a merger with [[Packard]] was approved.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=72}}</ref> The new [[Studebaker-Packard]] management decided to sever the expensive relationship with [[Loewy]] and Associates, thinking that their own in-house styling team should be given full control of [[Studebaker]] design efforts.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|title=Studebaker 1946\u20131966: The Classic Postwar Years|publisher=Motorbooks International Publishers and Wholesalers|year=1993|isbn=|location=Osceola, Wisconsin|pages=81}}</ref> Thus, in early 1955, the contract with [[Raymond Loewy]], which had existed since 1938, was not renewed, and Pietsch, along with everyone else, was given the option of staying with [[Loewy]] or switching over to [[Studebaker]] proper. Pietsch decided that the [[Loewy]] situation was much too tenuous and, even as shabby as [[Studebaker]] was at the time, opted to stay with the sinking ship.\n<br />\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, cab-forward, pick-up truck, by T.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job. After several months looking for work in the [[South Bend]] area, he went to [[Chicago]], where he was soon offered a position by the industrial design firm of Dave Chapman, Incorporated. Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W. Pietsch, 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Lynx, Two-seater Convertible, by T. W.

Soon this narrowed down to nothing but \"ornamentation,\" in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals on speedometers, tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work.

During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built a wide variety of items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, stabilizers, ailerons, tank hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the [[B-29]], to mention only a few.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1973|title=Body by Briggs|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=19|pages=29|via=}}</ref> But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from [[Packard]] and [[Chrysler]], among other companies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the [[Packard]] Clipper as well as some formal limousines on [[Chrysler]] chassis, and \"special sedans,\" some designed specifically for [[Walter P.

For most U.S. automobile companies, designs for the first two or three postwar years were not much more than facelifts of 1941 and 1942 models. This was certainly true for Ford\u2014efforts in 1946 were nearly all directed toward the first all-new model, which turned out to be the highly successful 1949 Ford.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bridges|first=John|title=Bob Bourke Designs for Studebaker|publisher=J.

Pietsch played a decisive role in this domestic success as well as in Chrysler's association with Italian auto makers\u2014first, a short-lived relationship with [[Pinin Farina]] in 1950, and then, in the following year, with [[Carrozzeria Ghia]] of [[Turin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langworth|first=Richard M.|date=1975|title=Thinking ahead: Ghia-Chrysler showcars|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=30|pages=18|via=}}</ref> By 1953, a half a dozen Italian-built Chrysler show-cars had been created. Under these ideal working conditions, it's a wonder that Pietsch didn't stay longer with Exner\u2014the potential at [[Chrysler]] for new and exciting things was enormous, but once again the thrill of a new challenge was too great. Responding in early 1952 to an attractive offer from [[Raymond Loewy]], brokered in part by his old friend Bob Koto, he moved from Detroit to [[South Bend, Indiana]], to join [[Raymond Loewy and Associates]], which at the time held the [[Studebaker]] design contract.\n<br />\n[[File:Banshee, two-door coupe, with transparent Plexiglass top, by T.

Shortly thereafter, all kinds of lucrative contracts came his way. By the late 1930s and early 40s, he had sold designs for [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] buses, Pensy railcars and locomotives, [[TWA]] sleeper planes, [[Matson, Inc.|Matson]] ships and large ocean liners, [[Pepsodent]] toothpaste tubes, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric shavers, buildings of all kinds, including supermarkets, and hundreds of other products, not the least of which were [[Studebaker]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lamm|first=Michael|date=1971|title=Before the new wore off: What the \"Stude Graveyard\" cars looked like when new|url=|journal=Special-Interest Autos, a publication of Hemmings Motor News|volume=6|pages=13|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Reese|first=Elizabeth|title=Raymond Loewy: Pioneer of American Industrial Design|publisher=Prestel-Verlag|year=1990|isbn=|location=Munich, Germany|pages=39-41}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 31, 1949|title=Up from the Egg|url=|journal=Time Magazine|volume=54(18)|pages=68-74|via=}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:White Speedster, with red underbody, by T.

There were no individual studios set up with all sorts of titles for the designers, just several large rooms located in the old Chippewa Avenue truck plant in [[South Bend]] where [[Studebaker]] had manufactured its aircraft engines and army trucks during the war. The designers had just one boss, Bob Bourke, and his assistant, Bob Koto, and everyone, including Bourke and Koto, wore many hats. They sketched, and modeled in clay; in fact, the emphasis was on modeling. They often worked into the small hours of the morning with no overtime pay. The clay work was new to Pietsch and by his own admission he never became very adept at it because designers in [[Detroit]], where he had received all his prior training, were not involved in modeling. He strongly believed, however, that designers should be skilled at drawing and rendering as well as modeling.\n[[File:Design for a Studebaker, high-speed express truck, by T. W.

Now, for the first time in his career, Pietsch was unable to immediately step into another automotive design job.

Commuting weekly by train between [[South Bend]] and [[Chicago]], he was responsible for the account of a department of [[Montgomery Ward]] and Company, which included, among other things, the design of water heaters, water softeners, water pumps, furnaces, air-conditioners, incinerators, and ventilating fans. He also did considerable work on the design of boats, outboard motors, and radios.\n[[File:Sovereign Coupe, black airbrush on red paper, by T. W.

Randal D. Faurot, newly appointed head of styling, called on Pietsch to help rebuild the department, offering him a position as his assistant that he couldn't refuse. In June 1962, however, frustrated and angry over management's abrupt decision to cancel a project that he had worked for many months\u2014the design for an all-new version of the [[Studebaker]] Lark for 1962\u2014Pietsch lost his temper and was fired.<ref name=\":0\" /> It was a tumultuous and abrupt ending to a frustrating, decade-long struggle at [[Studebaker]].\n\n==A last Stint at Chrysler, American Motors, and Retirement: 1962\u20131972==\nOnce again out of work, Pietsch wrote on July 2, 1962, to his old friend Cliff Voss in [[Detroit]], one of \"Exner's boys,\" with whom he had worked at [[Chrysler]] back in the early 1950s. Within a few weeks, Pietsch was back for a third and final hitch with the [[Chrysler Corporation]], but these turned out to be unhappy years. [[Chrysler]] was by now a completely different place. There was no longer the camaraderie and warm atmosphere that had been there before. The studios were now segregated and the old feeling of team effort, along with most of his old friends, was gone. Styling had become a big well-structured and impersonal organization much like the situation at [[Ford]] and [[General Motors]].\n<br />\n[[File:Lynx, two-seater convertible, by T. W.

The story involves German professor Otto Lidenbrock who believes there are [[Lava tube|volcanic tubes]] going toward the centre of the Earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans descend into the Icelandic volcano [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], encountering many adventures, including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the [[Stromboli]] volcano.\n\nThe genre of [[subterranean fiction]] already existed long before Verne. However, ''Journey'' considerably added to the genre's popularity and influenced later such writings. For example, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] explicitly acknowledged Verne's influence on his own ''[[Pellucidar]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in May 1863, in the Lidenbrock house in [[Hamburg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], with Professor Lidenbrock rushing home to peruse his latest purchase, an original [[runic]] [[manuscript]] of an [[Iceland]]ic [[saga]] written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] (Snorre Tarleson in some versions of the story), \"[[Heimskringla]]\"; the chronicle of the Norwegian kings who ruled over Iceland. While looking through the book, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in [[runes|runic script]] along with the name of a 16th-century Icelandic [[alchemy|alchemist]], Arne Saknussemm. (This was a first indication of Verne's love for [[cryptography]]. Coded, cryptic, or incomplete messages as a plot device would continue to appear in many of his works and in each case Verne would go a long way to explain not only the code used but also the mechanisms used to retrieve the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the runic characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock attempts a decipherment, deducing the message to be a kind of [[transposition cipher]]; but his results are as meaningless as the original.\n\nProfessor Lidenbrock decides to lock everyone in the house and force himself and the others (Axel, and the maid, Martha) to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's decipherment was correct, and only needs to be read backwards to reveal sentences written in rough Latin.{{efn|To produce the cipher, the text is written backwards, and then each letter and punctuation mark is placed in a separate cell of a 7x3 matrix, going row by row. When each cell is filled with the first 21 letters, the 22nd letter is placed in the first cell, and so again through the matrix repeatedly until the message is complete.  To decipher, one copies out the first letter of each cell, then the second, and so forth, and finally the resulting message is read backwards.}} Axel decides to keep the secret hidden from Professor Lidenbrock, afraid of what the Professor might do with the knowledge, but after two days without food he cannot stand the hunger and reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the note, which is revealed to be a medieval note written by Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered a passage to the centre of the Earth via Sn\u00e6fell in [[Iceland]]. In what Axel calls bad Latin, the deciphered message reads:\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|The Runic cryptogram]]\n{{quote|In {{sic|Snefflls}} Iokulis kraterem kem delibat umbra Skartaris Iulii intra kalendas deskende, audas uiator, {{sic|te}} terrestre kentrum attinges. Kod feki. Arne Saknussemm.}}\n\nIn slightly better Latin, with errors amended:\n{{quote|In Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm}}\n\nwhich, when translated into English, reads:\n\n{{quote|Descend, bold traveller, into the crater of the j\u00f6kull of [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull|Sn\u00e6fell]], which the shadow of Scartaris touches (lit: tastes) before the [[calends|Kalends]] of July, and you will attain the centre of the earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm|sign=|source=}}\n\n[[File:Snaefellsj\u00f6kull.jpg|thumb|[[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]].]]\nProfessor Lidenbrock is a man of astonishing impatience, and departs for Iceland immediately, taking his reluctant nephew with him. Axel, who, in comparison, is anti-adventurous, repeatedly tries to reason with him, explaining his fears of descending into a [[volcano]] and putting forward various scientific theories as to why the journey is impossible, but Professor Lidenbrock repeatedly keeps himself blinded against Axel's point of view. After a rapid journey via [[Kiel]] and [[Copenhagen]], they arrive in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], where the two procure the services of Hans Bjelke (a Danish-speaking Icelander [[common eider|eider]]down hunter) as their guide, and travel overland to the base of the volcano.\n\nIn late June, they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According to Saknussemm's message, the passage to the center of the Earth is through the one crater that is touched by the shadow of a nearby mountain peak at noon. However, the text also states that this is only true during the last days of June. During the next few days, with July rapidly approaching, the weather is too cloudy for any shadows. Axel silently rejoices, hoping this will force his uncle{{spaced ndash}}who has repeatedly tried to impart courage to him only to succeed in making him even more cowardly still{{spaced ndash}}to give up the project and return home. Alas for Axel, however, on the second to last day, the sun comes out and the mountain peak shows the correct crater to take.\n\nAfter descending into the crater, the three travellers set off into the bowels of the Earth, encountering many strange phenomena and great dangers, including a chamber filled with [[firedamp]], and steep-sided wells around the \"path\". After taking a wrong turn, they run out of water and Axel almost dies, but Hans taps into a neighbouring [[subterranean river]]. Lidenbrock and Axel name the resulting stream the \"Hansbach\" in his honour and the three are saved. At another point, Axel becomes separated from the others and is lost several miles from them. Luckily, a strange [[Acoustics|acoustic]] phenomenon allows him to communicate with them from some miles away, and they are soon reunited.\n\nAfter descending many miles, following the course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in [[petrified]] trees and giant [[mushroom]]s. The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the \"Lidenbrock Sea\" and the port as \"Port Gr\u00e4uben\", after the name of his goddaughter. While on the water, they see several [[prehistoric]] creatures such as a giant ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'', which fights with a ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge [[geyser]], which Lidenbrock names \"Axel Island\".\n\nA lightning storm again threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the coastline. This part of the coast, Axel discovers, is alive with prehistoric plant and animal life forms, including giant [[insect]]s and a herd of [[mastodon]]s. On a beach covered with bones, Axel discovers an [[gigantism|oversized]] [[human skull]]. Axel and Lidenbrock venture some way into the prehistoric forest, where Professor Lidenbrock points out, in a shaky voice, a prehistoric human, more than twelve feet in height, leaning against a tree and watching a herd of mastodons. Axel cannot be sure if he has really seen the man or not, and he and Professor Lidenbrock debate whether or not a proto-human [[civilization]] actually exists so far underground. The three wonder if the creature is a man-like ape, or an ape-like man. The sighting of the creature is considered the most alarming part of the story, and the explorers decide that it is better not to alert it to their presence as they fear it may be hostile.\n\nThe travellers continue to explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by what appears to be a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the [[granite]] wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with [[gun cotton]] and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the center of the Earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large volcanic chimney filling with [[water]] and [[magma]]. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a [[stratovolcano]]. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from [[Stromboli]], a [[high island|volcanic island]] located in southern Italy. They return to [[Hamburg]] to great acclaim{{spaced ndash}}Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Gr\u00e4uben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in [[Iceland]]. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.\n\nAt the very end of the book, Axel and Lidenbrock realize why their [[compass]] was behaving strangely after their journey on the raft. They realize that the needle was pointing the wrong way after being struck by an [[Ball lightning|electric fireball]] which nearly destroyed the wooden raft.\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe book was inspired by [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' of 1863 (and probably also influenced by Lyell's earlier ground-breaking work ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published 1830\u201333). By that time geologists had abandoned a literal biblical account of Earth's development and it was generally thought that the end of the [[last glacial period]] marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell's book also influenced [[Louis Figuier]]'s 1867 second edition of ''La Terre avant le d\u00e9luge'' (\"The Earth before the flood\") which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the [[Garden of Eden]] shown in the 1863 edition.<ref>Criticism: {{Citation\n | last = Browne\n | first = E.

The story involves German professor Otto Lidenbrock who believes there are [[Lava tube|volcanic tubes]] going toward the centre of the Earth. He, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans descend into the Icelandic volcano [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], encountering many adventures, including prehistoric animals and natural hazards, before eventually coming to the surface again in southern Italy, at the [[Stromboli]] volcano.\n\nThe genre of [[subterranean fiction]] already existed long before Verne. However, ''Journey'' considerably added to the genre's popularity and influenced later such writings. For example, [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] explicitly acknowledged Verne's influence on his own ''[[Pellucidar]]'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins in May 1863, in the Lidenbrock house in [[Hamburg]], [[German Confederation|Germany]], with Professor Lidenbrock rushing home to peruse his latest purchase, an original [[runic]] [[manuscript]] of an [[Iceland]]ic [[saga]] written by [[Snorri Sturluson]] (Snorre Tarleson in some versions of the story), \"[[Heimskringla]]\"; the chronicle of the Norwegian kings who ruled over Iceland. While looking through the book, Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel find a coded note written in [[runes|runic script]] along with the name of a 16th-century Icelandic [[alchemy|alchemist]], Arne Saknussemm. (This was a first indication of Verne's love for [[cryptography]]. Coded, cryptic, or incomplete messages as a plot device would continue to appear in many of his works and in each case Verne would go a long way to explain not only the code used but also the mechanisms used to retrieve the original text.) Lidenbrock and Axel [[Transliteration|transliterate]] the runic characters into Latin letters, revealing a message written in a seemingly bizarre code. Lidenbrock attempts a decipherment, deducing the message to be a kind of [[transposition cipher]]; but his results are as meaningless as the original.\n\nProfessor Lidenbrock decides to lock everyone in the house and force himself and the others (Axel, and the maid, Martha) to go without food until he cracks the code. Axel discovers the answer when fanning himself with the deciphered text: Lidenbrock's decipherment was correct, and only needs to be read backwards to reveal sentences written in rough Latin.{{efn|To produce the cipher, the text is written backwards, and then each letter and punctuation mark is placed in a separate cell of a 7x3 matrix, going row by row. When each cell is filled with the first 21 letters, the 22nd letter is placed in the first cell, and so again through the matrix repeatedly until the message is complete.  To decipher, one copies out the first letter of each cell, then the second, and so forth, and finally the resulting message is read backwards.}} Axel decides to keep the secret hidden from Professor Lidenbrock, afraid of what the Professor might do with the knowledge, but after two days without food he cannot stand the hunger and reveals the secret to his uncle. Lidenbrock translates the note, which is revealed to be a medieval note written by Saknussemm, who claims to have discovered a passage to the centre of the Earth via Sn\u00e6fell in [[Iceland]]. In what Axel calls bad Latin, the deciphered message reads:\n[[File:Jules verne cryptogramme.png|thumb|The Runic cryptogram]]\n{{quote|In {{sic|Snefflls}} Iokulis kraterem kem delibat umbra Skartaris Iulii intra kalendas deskende, audas uiator, {{sic|te}} terrestre kentrum attinges. Kod feki. Arne Saknussemm.}}\n\nIn slightly better Latin, with errors amended:\n{{quote|In Sneffels Jokulis craterem, quem delibat umbra Scartaris, Julii intra kalendas descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges; quod feci. Arne Saknussemm}}\n\nwhich, when translated into English, reads:\n\n{{quote|Descend, bold traveller, into the crater of the j\u00f6kull of [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull|Sn\u00e6fell]], which the shadow of Scartaris touches (lit: tastes) before the [[calends|Kalends]] of July, and you will attain the centre of the earth. I did it. Arne Saknussemm|sign=|source=}}\n\n[[File:Snaefellsj\u00f6kull.jpg|thumb|[[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]].]]\nProfessor Lidenbrock is a man of astonishing impatience, and departs for Iceland immediately, taking his reluctant nephew with him. Axel, who, in comparison, is anti-adventurous, repeatedly tries to reason with him, explaining his fears of descending into a [[volcano]] and putting forward various scientific theories as to why the journey is impossible, but Professor Lidenbrock repeatedly keeps himself blinded against Axel's point of view. After a rapid journey via [[Kiel]] and [[Copenhagen]], they arrive in [[Reykjav\u00edk]], where the two procure the services of Hans Bjelke (a Danish-speaking Icelander [[common eider|eider]]down hunter) as their guide, and travel overland to the base of the volcano.\n\nIn late June, they reach the volcano, which has three craters. According to Saknussemm's message, the passage to the center of the Earth is through the one crater that is touched by the shadow of a nearby mountain peak at noon. However, the text also states that this is only true during the last days of June. During the next few days, with July rapidly approaching, the weather is too cloudy for any shadows. Axel silently rejoices, hoping this will force his uncle{{spaced ndash}}who has repeatedly tried to impart courage to him only to succeed in making him even more cowardly still{{spaced ndash}}to give up the project and return home. Alas for Axel, however, on the second to last day, the sun comes out and the mountain peak shows the correct crater to take.\n\nAfter descending into the crater, the three travellers set off into the bowels of the Earth, encountering many strange phenomena and great dangers, including a chamber filled with [[firedamp]], and steep-sided wells around the \"path\". After taking a wrong turn, they run out of water and Axel almost dies, but Hans taps into a neighbouring [[subterranean river]]. Lidenbrock and Axel name the resulting stream the \"Hansbach\" in his honour and the three are saved. At another point, Axel becomes separated from the others and is lost several miles from them. Luckily, a strange [[Acoustics|acoustic]] phenomenon allows him to communicate with them from some miles away, and they are soon reunited.\n\nAfter descending many miles, following the course of the Hansbach, they reach an unimaginably vast cavern. This underground world is lit by electrically charged gas at the ceiling, and is filled with a very deep subterranean ocean, surrounded by a rocky coastline covered in [[petrified]] trees and giant [[mushroom]]s. The travelers build a raft out of trees and set sail. The Professor names this sea the \"Lidenbrock Sea\" and the port as \"Port Gr\u00e4uben\", after the name of his goddaughter. While on the water, they see several [[prehistoric]] creatures such as a giant ''[[Ichthyosaurus]]'', which fights with a ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'' and wins. After the battle between the monsters, the party comes across an island with a huge [[geyser]], which Lidenbrock names \"Axel Island\".\n\nA lightning storm again threatens to destroy the raft and its passengers, but instead throws them onto the coastline. This part of the coast, Axel discovers, is alive with prehistoric plant and animal life forms, including giant [[insect]]s and a herd of [[mastodon]]s. On a beach covered with bones, Axel discovers an [[gigantism|oversized]] [[human skull]]. Axel and Lidenbrock venture some way into the prehistoric forest, where Professor Lidenbrock points out, in a shaky voice, a prehistoric human, more than twelve feet in height, leaning against a tree and watching a herd of mastodons. Axel cannot be sure if he has really seen the man or not, and he and Professor Lidenbrock debate whether or not a proto-human [[civilization]] actually exists so far underground. The three wonder if the creature is a man-like ape, or an ape-like man. The sighting of the creature is considered the most alarming part of the story, and the explorers decide that it is better not to alert it to their presence as they fear it may be hostile.\n\nThe travellers continue to explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by what appears to be a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the [[granite]] wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with [[gun cotton]] and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the center of the Earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large volcanic chimney filling with [[water]] and [[magma]]. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a [[stratovolcano]]. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from [[Stromboli]], a [[high island|volcanic island]] located in southern Italy. They return to [[Hamburg]] to great acclaim{{spaced ndash}}Professor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Gr\u00e4uben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in [[Iceland]]. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.\n\nAt the very end of the book, Axel and Lidenbrock realize why their [[compass]] was behaving strangely after their journey on the raft. They realize that the needle was pointing the wrong way after being struck by an [[Ball lightning|electric fireball]] which nearly destroyed the wooden raft.\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe book was inspired by [[Charles Lyell]]'s ''[[Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man]]'' of 1863 (and probably also influenced by Lyell's earlier ground-breaking work ''[[Principles of Geology]]'', published 1830\u201333). By that time geologists had abandoned a literal biblical account of Earth's development and it was generally thought that the end of the [[last glacial period]] marked the first appearance of humanity, but Lyell drew on new findings to put the origin of human beings much further back in the deep geological past. Lyell's book also influenced [[Louis Figuier]]'s 1867 second edition of ''La Terre avant le d\u00e9luge'' (\"The Earth before the flood\") which included dramatic illustrations of savage men and women wearing animal skins and wielding stone axes, in place of the [[Garden of Eden]] shown in the 1863 edition.<ref>Criticism: {{Citation\n | last = Browne\n | first = E.

The plates are more numerous than the book, which was published with an 1872 title page. If it was released in 1871 as a single volume, it was late in the year. This \"True\" first edition also found in an octavo normal book size (not Annual size), has been overlooked by bibliographers.{{what?|date=March 2020|reason=explain technical terms, both 1st ed. and book size}} It has a place of pre-eminence up to about a third of the way through the 12 monthly issues and then slides down into the main body of the journal.

It changes the Professor's name to Hardwigg, Axel's name to Harry (or Henry) Lawson, and Gr\u00e4uben's name to Gretchen. It omits some chapters, while rewriting or adding portions to others. The redactor's note by Norm Wolcott, at Project Gutenberg, claims that this translation is the most popularly reprinted one, despite the flaws. \n\nThe 1877 translation by Ward, Lock, & Co., Ltd., translated by Frederick Amadeus Malleson, is more faithful, though it too has some slight rewrites (according to the redactor at its Project Gutenberg page,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3748|title=A Journey into the Interior of the Earth|first=Jules|last=Verne|date=1 February 2003|publisher=|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>where its title is translated as ''Journey to the Interior of the Earth'').\n\nThe 1877 translation by [[Ward Lock & Co|Ward Lock & Co Ltd.]], translated by Frederick Amadeus Malleson, was adapted by AD Classic Books' 2008 edition of ''Journey to the Center of the Earth''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0980921031|title=A Journey to the Center of the Earth|first=Jules|last=Verne|editor-first=A.

Roumanis, antiquated writing and out of date sayings were replaced, which makes this the most \"modernized\" version available.\n\nThe novel frequently uses the device of the Professor explaining or arguing scientific matters with Axel, in order to communicate scientific facts on which the worldview is based. In the midst of their descent, this role reverses at one point, as Axel points out strata to the Professor as another example of the same storytelling method. Many things postulated in the novel are now known to be incorrect, including the temperature of space being minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit, and volcanoes erupting due to a reaction between water and chemicals in the Earth's crust.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\n===Film===\n*1959: ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', USA, directed by [[Henry Levin (film director)|Henry Levin]], starring [[James Mason]] and [[Pat Boone]].

The film introduces two new main characters: a female explorer ([[Arlene Dahl]]) and a main antagonist ([[Thayer David]]).\n*1978: ''[[Where Time Began|Viaje al centro de la Tierra]]'', Spain, directed by [[Juan Piquer Sim\u00f3n]], starring [[Kenneth More]] and Pep Munn\u00e9. It was distributed in both the U.S. in theaters as ''[[Where Time Began]]'' and the U.K. on TV as ''The Fabulous Journey to the Centre of the Earth''.\n*1989: ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1989 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' took only the title and a general idea from the Verne novel, and had a unique plot aimed at a [[Adolescence|teen]] audience. It was written by [[Debra Ricci]], [[Regina Davis]], [[Kitty Chalmers]], and [[Rusty Lemorande]], and was directed by Lemorande and [[Albert Pyun]]. It stars [[Emo Philips]], [[Paul Carafotes]], [[Jaclyn Bernstein]], [[Kathy Ireland]], [[Janet Du Plessis]], [[Nicola Cowper]], [[Lochner De Kock]], and [[Ilan Mitchell-Smith]]. It was based on an uncompleted version, more faithful to Verne's text, written and directed by Lemorande, that had been left unfinished because of [[Cannon Films]]' premature closure.\n*2008: ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008 Hollywood film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' is a 3-D film by [[Eric Brevig]]. Cast members include [[Brendan Fraser]], [[Anita Briem]] and [[Josh Hutcherson]].

It was released as ''Journey to Middle Earth'' in the United Kingdom.\n\n*[[Walt Disney Pictures]] began work on a ''Journey'' adaptation in the late 1990s, but was not happy with the appearance of the caverns, so the project was scrapped. The cavern scenes were altered and used in the production of their 2001 film ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''.\n\n===Television===\n*An animated television series, ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (TV series)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'', first broadcast in 1967 on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], starring the voices of [[Ted Knight]], [[Pat Harrington, Jr.]], and [[Jane Webb]], only loosely based on Verne's novel and based more on the 1959 film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Journey to the Center of the Earth|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061270/combined|work=IMDb|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.|accessdate=18 February 2014}}</ref>\n*The first part of the second series of ''[[Around the World with Willy Fog]]'' entitled ''[[Willy Fog 2]]'' by Spanish studio [[BRB Internacional]] was \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\".\n*A limited animation television special in the ''[[Famous Classic Tales]]'' series was aired by [[CBS]] in 1977.\n*In 1993, [[NBC]] aired a made-for-TV film version with a cast including [[John Neville (actor)|John Neville]], [[F.

(This is evident when he reveals that he tried to dig to the center of the Earth at the age of twelve.) ''[[Back to the Future Part III]]'', especially, pays homage to the book when Dr. Brown carves his initials in a mineshaft after storing the time machine, just like Arne Saknussemm did to help guide future explorers.
