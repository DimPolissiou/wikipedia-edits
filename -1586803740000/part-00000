The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates. It was the intention of writer Joseph Stefano to make her at a young age as attractive as Norman had been in the first film.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBQyz8dBaEU PSYCHO LEGACY Facebook Clip 8 - Olivia Hussey on Mother]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Henry Thomas]] was cast as young [[Norman Bates]], Perkins wanted to meet with him and discuss the role. In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]]. [[Camille Paglia]] commented that the only reason to watch it was \"to see Anne Heche being assassinated\", but that \"it should have been a much more important work and event than it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Sragow|first=Michael|title=The Savage id|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/08/13/hitchcock_paglia/|publisher=Salon|accessdate=25 November 2012|date=13 August 1999}}</ref> A number of critics and writers viewed Van Sant's version more as an experiment in [[shot-for-shot]] remakes. Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that the film \"demonstrates that a shot-by-shot remake is pointless; genius apparently resides between or beneath the shots, or in chemistry that cannot be timed or counted.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS/812060301/1023 | title=Review of Psycho (1998 film) | first=Roger | last=Ebert | date=1998-12-06 | authorlink=Roger Ebert | accessdate=2007-11-03 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> Screenwriter [[Joseph Stefano]], who worked on the 1960 version, thought that although she spoke the same lines, Anne Heche portrays Marion Crane as an entirely different character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Psycho Analysis: An Interview With Screenwriter Joseph Stefano | url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A74285 | publisher=[[The Austin Chronicle]] | date=1999-10-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> Even Van Sant admitted that it was an experiment that proved that no one can really copy a film exactly the same way as the original.<ref>{{cite news | title=The odd world of Gus Van Sant | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/07/14/news/gus.php | publisher=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=2005-07-15 | accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] gave the film a positive review, calling it an \"artful, good-looking remake (a modest term, but it beats plagiarism) that shrewdly revitalizes the aspects of the real ''Psycho'' (1960) that it follows most faithfully but seldom diverges seriously or successfully from one of the cinema's most brilliant blueprints\"; she noted that the \"absence of anything like [[Anthony Perkins]]'s sensational performance with that vitally birdlike presence and sneaky way with a [[Double entendre|double-entendre]] (\"A boy's best friend is his mother\") is the new film's greatest weakness.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D0DE7DD1E3BF936A35751C1A96E958260| title=The Mama's Boy, His Motel Guest And That Shower| last=Maslin| first=Janet| authorlink=Janet Maslin| publisher=[[The New York Times]]| date=December 5, 1998| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> Critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film a rating of one out of four stars, or \"BOMB\" compared to the four stars he gave the original. He describes it as a \"Slow, stilted, completely pointless scene-for-scene remake of the Hitchcock classic (with a few awkward new touches to taint its claim as an exact replica.)\" He ultimately calls it \"an insult, rather than a tribute to a landmark film.\"{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Continuity===\nWhile ''Bates Motel'' (1987) was a partial continuation of the series as it continued from where ''Psycho'' left off, it ignored the continuity of ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'', and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' due to the death of Norman Bates in the film and the fact that Bates is deemed sane and returns to the Bates Motel in ''Psycho II''. ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth. The deep conflict being rehearsed and resolved in these movies is that of the [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal complex]].\"\n\n==Home media==\n[[File:Psycho DVD set.JPG|thumb|right|200px|2003 DVD box set of the first four main films ([[United Kingdom|UK]]).]]\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'', ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'', the ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' remake and ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' have been released on [[VHS]].

Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

The first film, ''Psycho'', was directed by filmmaker [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref>http://www.thepsychomovies.com/movies/psycho/</ref> Subsequently, another film related to the series was made: an [[Hitchcock (film)|Alfred Hitchcock biopic]] based on the book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''. Also, an independent documentary called ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' was released on October 19, 2010. It mostly focused on ''Psycho II'', ''Psycho III'' and ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'', but did cover the impact and legacy of the original film. \n\nA five-season TV series, ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]'', aired on [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] between 2013 and 2017. In a modern-day setting, it is an imagining of the Norman and (at first, a living) Norma Bates characters, and their unusual relationship. It stars [[Freddie Highmore]] as teenaged Norman and [[Vera Farmiga]] as mother Norma.\n\nThe films focus on the life of [[Norman Bates]], a deeply disturbed young man who operates the Bates Motel. He is mentally unstable from a domineering relationship with his mother, which results in him having a psychotic twisted personality and, as a result, he occasionally kills people.\n\n==Novels==\n{{unsourced section|date=August 2016}}\n===''Psycho'' (1959)===\n{{Main|Psycho (novel)}}\nIn 1959, the novel ''Psycho'' was published. It was loosely based on the Wisconsin serial killer and cannibal [[Ed Gein]]. Author [[Robert Bloch]] lived 40 miles away from Gein's farmhouse and liked the idea of somebody being able to kill people in a small community and get away with it for years without being caught. The character of [[Norman Bates]] was very different in the novel from in [[Psycho (1960 film)|the film version]]. In the novel, Bates is overweight, in his early 40s and drinks heavily. When [[Joseph Stefano]] adapted the novel into the screenplay, he made the character of Norman young, attractive and vulnerable.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1982)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (novel)}}\nIn 1982, Bloch wrote a sequel novel called ''Psycho II'' which had nothing to do with the [[Psycho II (film)|1983 film version]]. In the novel, Norman Bates escapes the mental institution and goes to Hollywood to stop the production of a film based on his life. Many critics and fans described the novel as being silly and weird and couldn't have possibly been made into a film.\n\n===''Psycho House'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho House}}\nIn 1990, due to the pressure from his publishing company, Bloch wrote a third novel called ''Psycho House''. However, according to horror writer [[David J. Schow]], when writing it Bloch originally called it ''Psycho 13''. In the novel, ten years after Norman Bates' death, the Bates mansion and motel are bought as [[tourist attraction]]s and a series of murders begin to take place.\n\n==Films==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Occupation\n! colspan=\"6\" | Film title\n|-\n!

While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitation, follows her. When she trades her car for another at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of the motel's disconnection from a new [[Interstate highway system|Interstate]] and mentions he lives with [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to supper. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal, she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like this, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp.\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Vera Miles]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[Martin Balsam]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will call again after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[John McIntire]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will, Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$40,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new hotel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Richmond ([[Simon Oakland]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went mad with jealousy and murdered them both. Consumed with guilt, Norman \"erased the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he was \"Mother\", he acted, talked, and dressed as she would. The psychiatrist concludes that the \"Mother\" personality now has complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove that she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp.\n\n===''Psycho II'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Psycho II (film)}}\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is released from a mental institution after 22 years. [[Lila Crane|Lila Loomis]] ([[Vera Miles]]), the sister of Bates' victim [[Marion Crane]] and widow of the now-deceased Sam Loomis, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the six people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home, the Bates Motel, with the house behind it on the hill, by Dr. Bill Raymond ([[Robert Loggia]]), who assures him everything will be fine. He is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey ([[Dennis Franz]]). The following day, Norman reports to a pre-arranged job at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]). One of his co-workers there is Mary Loomis ([[Meg Tilly]]), a young waitress. Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned his beloved establishment into a sleazy adult motel.\n\nNorman's adjustment back into society appears to be going along well until \"Mother\" begins to make her presence known. Norman gets mysterious notes from \"Mother\" at the house and diner. Phone calls come from someone claiming to be Norman's mother. Toomey picks a fight at the diner after Norman fires him. Later, a figure in a black dress stabs Toomey to death with a kitchen knife as he is packing to leave the motel. Norman begins to doubt his sanity when he begins hearing voices in the house. He enters his mother's bedroom to find it looks exactly as it did 22 years ago. A sound lures him to the attic, where he is locked in. Believing the house to be abandoned, a teenage couple sneaks in through the cellar window. They notice a female figure pacing in the next room. As they try to climb out, the boy is stabbed to death. The girl escapes and alerts the police. Mary eventually finds Norman in the attic. Sheriff Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) questions them about the boy's murder. He finds the cellar neat and orderly. Norman is about to admit that something suspicious is going on, but Mary claims that she has cleaned up the basement herself. After the sheriff leaves, Norman asks Mary why she lied. She explains that she had to save him from being arrested. Norman collapses into the chair with his head in his hands and moans, \"It's starting again!\"\n\nMary is startled later when she discovers someone looking at her through a peephole in the bathroom wall. She calls out to Norman, who is downstairs and out of reach. The two are horrified to find a bloody cloth that has been stuffed down the toilet. Norman appears confused and believes he may have committed another murder. Mary goes down to check the motel. In the parlor she is surprised by Lila, who reveals herself to be Mary's mother. She has been calling Norman claiming to be his mother, even going so far as to dress up as her and allowing him to see her in the window. Mary has been helping her. She was responsible for restoring Mother's room at the house and locking Norman in the attic. All of this was an attempt to drive Norman insane again and have him recommitted.\n\nMary's growing feelings for Norman, however, have been preying on her conscience leaving her to reconsider her actions. Meanwhile, Dr. Raymond discovers Mary's identity as Lila's daughter and informs Norman. He also orders the corpse of Norma Bates (which was buried in a proper grave after the events of the original film) to be exhumed, to prove that Norman isn't being haunted by his mother. Mary admits to Norman that she has been part of Lila's ruse, and that while she now refuses to continue, Lila won't stop. Mary goes to Lila's hotel and their argument is overheard by a bartender. Later, Lila drives over to Norman's house, unaware that Dr. Raymond is watching her from the Bates Motel as she sneaks into the cellar. While removing her \"Mother\" costume from a loose stone in the floor, another figure dressed as \"Mother\" steps out of the shadows and murders her. Dr. Raymond runs up to the house. Lila's body is not in the cellar.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary discovers that a car has been retrieved from the swamp, with Toomey's body in the trunk. Realizing the police will shortly arrive to arrest Norman, Mary returns to warn him. The phone rings in the house, Norman answers, and starts speaking to his \"mother\". Mary listens in and discovers that nobody is on the line with Norman. Terrified, Mary runs downstairs into the cellar, and quickly dresses up as Mother to confront Norman. Someone grabs her from behind, and she plunges the butcher knife into ... Dr. Raymond, who has sneaked back into the house. A stunned Mary runs downstairs and is confronted by a deranged Norman, who promises to cover up for \"Mother\". Mary tries to keep him away, repeatedly stabbing him in the hands and chest. He backs Mary into the fruit cellar to hide and slips on a pile of coal, which avalanches away from the wall, revealing Lila's body hidden behind it. Mary is now convinced that Norman had been committing the murders. She raises her knife to stab him and is shot to death by the incoming police. The sheriff inaccurately believes Lila and Mary committed all the murders.\n\nThat evening, a woman walks up the steps to the Bates' mansion. Bandaged from his injuries, Norman has set a place for dinner when he hears a knock at the door. It is Emma Spool, the kindly woman from the diner. Norman gives her a cup of tea. Mrs. Spool tells him that she is his real mother, that Mrs. Bates was her sister, who adopted Norman as an infant while Mrs. Spool was institutionalized. She further reveals that she was the murderer, having killed anybody who tried to harm her son. As she sips the tea, Norman kills her with a sudden blow to the head with a shovel. Norman is now completely insane again. He carries Mrs. Spool's body upstairs to Mother's room and we hear Mother's voice warn Norman not to play with \"filthy girls\". Norman reopens the Bates Motel and stands in front of the house, waiting for new customers as Mother watches from the window upstairs.\n\n===''Psycho III'' (1986)===\n{{Main|Psycho III}}\nMaureen Coyle ([[Diana Scarwid]]), a mentally unstable young nun, is on top of a bell tower about to commit suicide. When another nun tries to get her to come down, Maureen accidentally pushes her over the railing to her death. Another nun tells Maureen that she will burn in hell. She is forced to leave the convent after this ordeal.\n\n[[Norman Bates]] ([[Anthony Perkins]]) is still manning the desk at the Bates Motel and living with the preserved corpse of his real mother, [[Emma Spool]] ([[Claudia Bryar]]), whom Norman killed at the end of ''Psycho II''. Local law enforcement and Norman's ex-boss Ralph Statler ([[Robert Alan Browne]]) are concerned since Mrs. Spool has been missing for over a month. Duane Duke ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a sleazy musician desperate for money, is offered the job of assistant manager at the Bates Motel. Maureen, now the new long-term tenant, has some issues to resolve in her life. She gave up her vows as a nun only days before, and she isn't sure just how she feels about either spiritual or earthly matters.\n\nSheriff John Hunt ([[Hugh Gillin]]) and Statler have a conversation at the diner, when Tracy Venable ([[Roberta Maxwell]]), a pushy journalist from Los Angeles, interrupts them. She is working on an article about serial killers being put back on the streets. Venable is trying to back up her theory that Norman is back to his old ways again. Norman appears and Venable jumps at the chance to talk with him. Unaware of her ulterior motives Norman opens up to her, but is distracted when an exhausted Maureen enters and sits at the lunch counter. He is startled by Maureen's presence, because he feels she strongly resembles [[Marion Crane]] ([[Janet Leigh]]). Seeing the initials \"M.C.\" on her suitcase, Norman freaks out and leaves the diner. After a conversation with \"Mother\", Norman spies on Maureen as she undresses and heads into the bathroom to take a shower. Keeping \"her\" word, \"Mother\" enters Maureen's motel room with plans to kill her. Upon pulling back the shower curtain, it is revealed Maureen has attempted suicide by cutting her wrists, a sight which snaps Norman back to his \"normal\" side. Maureen looks up at \"Mother\" who is so weakened by what \"she\" sees, \"she\" lowers the knife. Due to blood loss, Maureen hallucinates and she mistakes Norman, dressed up as \"Mother\", for the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] holding a silver crucifix.\n\nMeanwhile, Tracy has met with Duane at a bar where they discuss Norman, and it seems Tracy blames Norman for Mrs. Spool's disappearance. When she leaves, Duane picks up another girl at the bar, Red ([[Juliette Cummins]]). Norman gets Maureen to the local hospital to save her life. After she is released, he invites her to stay back at the motel and they begin a romantic relationship. The same night, Duane and Red arrive at the motel and hear an argument between \"Mother\" and Norman, but think it's just a TV turned up too loud. Red and Duane, head to cabin 12 where they make love. Later that night, Red, makes it clear she wants more than just a fling. Calling him a pig, they argue. Duane, infuriated, throws her out of the cabin. Red heads down to the payphone to call a cab, where she realizes she is wearing her blouse backwards. As she takes it off to put it on the right way, \"Mother\" shatters the phone booth door and stabs a trapped Red to death. The next morning, Duane finds Norman scrubbing down the phone booth.\n\nA group from out of town arrive at the motel where they plan to watch the local [[American football|football]] game. Tracy comes to find Norman and ask questions about his past and \"Mother\". Norman becomes defensive with the reporter and tells her to leave, never to return. Later that night, he and Maureen go to a restaurant, where they dance and talk romantically, while Tracy searches Mrs. Spool's apartment. She discovers the Bates Motel's telephone number written on a magazine cover. Norman and Maureen return to the motel to find most of the other guests engaged in drunken stupor. Norman goes with Maureen to her room and they fall asleep in each other's arms having refused to make love. Some time afterwards, Patsy Boyle (Katt Shea Ruben), the only sober guest, wakes up Maureen to ensure her safety as Norman had left the door open, a bad idea with all the drunken guests around. Patsy, needing to use the bathroom, finds the one in Norman's parlor unoccupied, but \"Mother\" again emerges and slashes her throat. Norman (an homage to the reaction of finding Marion dead in the shower in the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'') gasps when he discovers Patsy's body. He buries her in the motel's ice chest outside the office.\n\nThe next morning, Sheriff Hunt and Deputy Leo appear at Norman's house to investigate Patsy's disappearance. Norman tries to prevent Hunt from entering his mother's bedroom, when he discovers that \"Mother\"/Mrs. Spool has disappeared completely. Outside, Tracy tells Maureen about Norman, and she, rather upset, leaves the motel and goes to stay with Father Brian (Gary Bayer), who took care of her at the hospital. Meanwhile, Tracy is convinced Norman is behind the latest disappearances. Norman searches for his mother all over the house and finds a note from her stating that she is in cabin 12. When Norman arrives at the cabin, he learns it was Duane who took \"Mother\". Duane confronts him then attempts to blackmail Norman into paying him off, or he'll turn Norman into the police. He tells Duane he doesn't have that kind of money, but Duane reminds him that Norman has made a lot of cash from his business, and if Norman doesn't give money for his silence, he will go to the police. He agrees to Duane's blackmail demands, but he then unexpectedly throws an ashtray at Duane's head. They fight and Norman seemingly kills Duane by hitting him several times with his own guitar. Terrified of what he has done, he blames \"Mother\" for this.\n\nTracy talks to Statler and Myrna ([[Lee Garlington]]) about Mrs. Spool and discovers she was working at the diner before Statler bought it from Harvey Leach. Tracy meets with Leach, a resident at an assisted living facility, and is informed that Mrs. Spool had also once been institutionalized for murder. Meanwhile, Norman drives Duane's car to the swamp with Duane and Patsy's bodies in it. Duane turns out to be alive and attacks Norman, who accidentally drives the car into the swamp. He struggles out of the car while Duane drowns. Tracy reads some old newspapers at her study and discovers about the \"Bates kidnapping\".\n\nMaureen convinces herself that Norman is her true love. She returns to the motel and takes a shower before visiting Norman at his house. They share a tender moment at the top of the staircase when \"Mother\" shouts furiously at Norman, which startles him and causes him to lose grip on Maureen's hands. She falls down the stairs into the Cupid statue at the base of the stairs. She goes limp and sinks to the floor revealing the arrow had punctured her skull. Distraught, Norman screams and confronts his mother, saying that he will get her for this. \"You don't have the guts, boy!\" declares \"Mother\".\n\nAt that moment, Tracy arrives at the motel and tries to find Maureen. She enters the house only to find her lying dead on the couch of the living room which is filled with lit candles. Then she sees Norman dressed as \"Mother\", holding a knife, and tries to flee. She tries to reason with Norman by explaining his family history: Emma Spool, who ''was'' in fact his aunt, was in love with Norman's father, but he married her sister, Norma, instead. Mrs. Spool, having serious psychological problems, kidnapped Norman when he was a baby after she killed Mr. Bates, believing Norman was the child \"she should have had with him.\" She discovers Mrs. Spool's corpse in the bedroom, and Norman takes off his mother's dress. \"Mother\" orders him to kill Tracy, and when Norman raises the knife, he instead brutally attacks \"Mother,\" dismembering her preserved remains. The last scene shows Sheriff Hunt taking Norman to his squad car, with Father Brian and Tracy following behind. Hunt informs Norman that they may never let him out of the institution again, Norman replies, \"But I'll be free... I'll finally be free.\" Norman, sitting silently in the back of the squad car on the way to the institution, enjoys his victory over his mother by caressing a trophy: the severed hand of Mrs. Spool. He smiles sardonically as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (1987)===\n{{main|Bates Motel (film)}}\nAlex West ([[Bud Cort]]) is a mentally disturbed youth who was admitted to an asylum after killing his abusive stepfather. At the asylum, he roomed with [[Norman Bates]] ([[Kurt Paul]]) and they eventually became close friends. Years later, Norman dies and Alex learns that he has inherited the Bates Motel. He travels to Norman's California hometown (renamed Fairville for this film; in the original film it was Fairvale) and with a little help from teenage runaway Willy ([[Lori Petty]]) and local handyman Henry Watson ([[Moses Gunn]]), Alex struggles to re-open the motel for business, until rumors about the place being haunted by the ghost of Norman's mother, Mrs. Bates, are apparently true. Only to find that the haunting was a prank and the ghost was the bank manager, Tom Fuller ([[Gregg Henry]]), who refused to give Alex a loan by trying to scare him away. Tom is then forced to help Alex and the others with renovating the motel or face prison for fraud. The motel was soon finished with the renovation.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbara Peters ([[Kerrie Keane]]) runs away from home and ends up staying in Alex's motel for the night, contemplating suicide for getting older, going through three divorces, and not having children. Barbara meets a teenage girl ([[Khrystyne Haje]]), who invites Barbara to dance at an after prom party in the motel with her and her teenage friends, including Tony Scotti ([[Jason Bateman]]), though Barbara felt uncomfortable hanging with young kids. It is then revealed that Barbara's real name is Sally, and that the teenage girl is her younger self from an alternate dimension who took her own life and is now trapped in \"the other side\", along with Tony, and other teens who also committed suicide. Sally tells Barbara that she has a life worth living for, then Sally leaves with the rest of the group. Barbara leaves the motel the next day, planning to live her life to the fullest. Alex looks at the screen telling viewers, \"If you ever need a room, come by. I can't say for sure what you'll find, but it is what makes the world go around.\"\n\n===''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' (1990)===\n{{Main|Psycho IV: The Beginning}}\nFran Ambrose ([[CCH Pounder]]) is a radio talk show host who is talking on the topic of \"matricide\" (when children kill their mothers) with guest Dr. Richmond ([[Warren Frost]]), who was [[Norman Bates]]' former psychologist. The radio receives a call from Norman Bates ([[Anthony Perkins]]), who has re-entered society and married his former psychiatrist, Connie (Donna Mitchell). Under the alias of \"Ed\" (possibly a reference to Ed Gein, the killer after whom the character of Norman was modeled), Norman tells his story, which the audience sees as a series of flashbacks set in the 1940s and 1950s. Some flashbacks are [[Reverse chronology|slightly out of order]]. The chronological story is: In 1950, Norman's mother, [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|Norma Bates]] ([[Olivia Hussey]]) had schizophrenia (see ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''); she was smothering Norman and would have violent mood swings. Due to Norman's sexual repression at her hands, when she was frolicking with him he had an incestuous erection, causing her to dress him in women's clothing and taunt him by calling him \"Norma.\" She then got engaged to a man named Chet Rudolph (Thomas Schuster), who would beat up Norman. Eventually Norman got fed up with her allowing Chet to be in their lives and poisoned them both, albeit reluctantly. He then developed his infamous multiple personality disorder and stole her corpse to create the illusion that she was alive - whenever her corpse spoke to him, the \"Norma\" personality would take over. This caused Norman as \"Norma\" to kill two women who wanted to have sex with him.\n\nThroughout the spaces in the flashbacks, Dr. Richmond realizes \"Ed\" is Norman and tries to convince Fran to trace the calls. Richmond's worries are dismissed because they cannot trace the call and they believe they can talk Norman out of the reason he called: he fears he will kill again. He tells Fran that Connie got pregnant against his wishes and that he does not want another \"monster\". He then tells Fran he does believe his mother is dead, but he will kill Connie \"with my own hands, just like the first time\". He then takes Connie to his mother's house and attempts to kill her, but after Connie reassures Norman that their child will not be a monster, he drops his knife in shame and Connie forgives him. He then burns the house where all his unhappiness began. As he tries to escape the flames, he hallucinates that he sees his victims, Chet, his mother and eventually himself preserving her corpse. He and Connie leave the scene with Norman stating, \"I'm free.\"  However, as the credits roll, the sound of his newborn baby crying can be heard.\n\n===''Psycho'' (1998)===\n{{Main|Psycho (1998 film)}}\nIn need of money to get her boyfriend Sam Loomis ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) out of debt, [[Marion Crane]] ([[Anne Heche]]) steals $400,000 from her employer and flees [[Phoenix, Arizona]] by car. While en route to Sam's [[California]] home, she parks along the road to sleep. A highway patrol officer awakens her and, suspicious of her agitated state, begins to follow her. When she trades her car for another one at a dealership, he notes the new vehicle's details. Marion returns to the road but, rather than drive in a heavy storm, decides to spend the night at the Bates Motel.  The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]] ([[Vince Vaughn]]), tells Marion he rarely has customers because of a new interstate nearby and mentions he lives with his mother in the house overlooking the motel. He invites Marion to have supper with him. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother about letting Marion in the house, and during the meal she angers him by suggesting he institutionalize his mother. He admits he would like to do so, but does not want to abandon her.\n\nMarion resolves to return to Phoenix to return the money. After calculating how she can repay the money she has spent, Marion dumps her notes down the toilet and begins to shower. An anonymous female figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Finding the corpse, Norman is horrified. He cleans the bathroom and places Marion's body, wrapped in the shower curtain, and all her possessions &mdash; including the money &mdash; in the trunk of her car and sinks it in a nearby swamp...\n\nShortly afterward, Sam is contacted by both Marion's sister [[Lila Crane]] ([[Julianne Moore]]) and private detective Milton Arbogast ([[William H. Macy]]), who has been hired by Marion's employer to find her and recover the money. Arbogast traces Marion to the motel and questions Norman, who unconvincingly lies that Marion stayed for one night and left the following morning. He refuses to let Arbogast talk to his mother, claiming she is ill. Arbogast calls Lila to update her and tells her he will contact her again within an hour after he questions Norman's mother.\n\nArbogast enters Norman's house and at the top of the stairs is attacked by a figure who slashes his face three times with a knife, pushes him down the stairs, then stabs him to death. When Arbogast does not call Lila, she and Sam contact the local police. Deputy Sheriff Al Chambers ([[Philip Baker Hall]]) is perplexed to learn Arbogast saw a woman in a window, since Norman's mother died ten years ago. Norman confronts his mother and urges her to hide in the cellar. She rejects the idea and orders him out of her room, but against her will Norman carries her to the cellar.\n\nPosing as a married couple, Sam and Lila check into the motel and search Marion's room, where they find a scrap of paper in the toilet with \"$400,000\" written on it. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house to search for his mother. Sam suggests to Norman that he killed Marion for the money so he could buy a new motel. Realizing Lila is not around, Norman knocks Sam unconscious with a golf club and rushes to the house. Lila sees him and hides in the cellar where she discovers the semi-preserved and [[mummy|mummified]] body of Norman's mother. Wearing his mother's clothes and a wig and carrying a knife, Norman enters and tries to attack Lila, but she is rescued by Sam.\n\nAfter Norman's arrest, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Fred Richmond ([[Robert Forster]]) tells Sam and Lila that Norman's dead mother is living in Norman's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] as an [[dissociative identity disorder|alternate personality]]. After the death of Norman's father, the pair lived as if they were the only people in the world. When his mother found a lover, Norman went over the edge with jealousy and murdered both of them. Consumed with guilt, he tried to \"erase the crime\" by bringing his mother back to life in his mind. He stole her corpse and preserved the body. When he is \"Mother\", he acts, talks, and dresses as she would. Norman imagined his mother would be as jealous of a woman to whom he might be attracted just as he was of his mother's lover, and so \"Mother\" kills any woman he has feelings for; when Norman regains consciousness, he believes that his mother has committed the crime, and covers up for her. It is implied that Norman is responsible for the unsolved disappearances of two young girls. Richmond concludes that the \"Mother\" personality has now taken complete control of Norman's mind.\n\nIn the final scene, Norman sits in a cell, thinking in \"Mother's\" voice. In a voiceover, \"Mother\" explains that she plans to prove to the authorities she is incapable of violence by refusing to swat a fly that has landed on her hand. The final shot shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, and then goes to end credits.\n\n==Television==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Series\n! scope=\"col\" |Season\n! scope=\"col\" |Episodes\n! scope=\"col\" |First released\n! scope=\"col\" |Last released\n! scope=\"col\" |Showrunner(s)\n! scope=\"col\" |Network(s)\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''[[Bates Motel (TV series)|Bates Motel]]''\n| 5\n| 50\n| March 18, 2013 \n| April 24, 2017\n| TBA\n| [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===''Bates Motel'' (2013\u20132017)===\n{{Main|Bates Motel (TV series)}}\nOn January 23, 2012, A&E announced that a television series called ''Bates Motel'' was in development at the network.

Both had deceased, domineering mothers, and had sealed off one room of their house as a shrine to their mother, and both dressed in women's clothing. However, there are many differences between Bates and Ed Gein. Among others, Gein would not be strictly considered a serial killer, having officially killed \"only\" two people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reavill|2007|p=228}} \"With only two confirmed kills, Ed did not technically qualify as a serial killer (the traditional minimum requirement was three\"</ref> [[Peggy Robertson]], Hitchcock's production assistant, read [[Anthony Boucher]]'s positive review of the Bloch novel and decided to show the book to Hitchcock, even though readers at Hitchcock's home studio [[Paramount Pictures]] rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500.<ref name=\"Leigh6\">Leigh, p. 6</ref> He reportedly ordered Robertson to buy up copies to keep the novel's surprises for the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=19\u201320}}</ref> Hitchcock chose to film ''Psycho'' to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: ''Flamingo Feather'' and ''No Bail for the Judge''. Hitchcock also faced genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own and so wanted to film new material. The director also disliked stars' salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=18\u201319}}</ref>\n\nParamount executives did not want to produce the film and refused to provide the budget that Hitchcock received from them for previous films with the studio.<ref name=\"Rebello23\">{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|p=23}}</ref> Hitchcock decided to plan for ''Psycho'' to be filmed quickly and inexpensively, similar to an episode of his ongoing television series ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', and hired the television series crew as Shamley Productions. He proposed this cost-conscious approach to Paramount but executives again refused to finance the film, telling him their sound stages were occupied or booked even though production was known to be in a slump. Hitchcock countered with the offer to finance the film personally and to film it at Universal-International if Paramount would distribute. He also deferred his director's fee of $250,000 for a 60% ownership of the film negative. This offer was finally accepted. Hitchcock also experienced resistance from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive [[Joan Harrison (screenwriter)|Joan Harrison]], who did not think the film would be a success.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rebello|1990|pp=26\u201329}}</ref>\n\nHitchcock hired writer James Cavanaugh to write a draft of the screenplay. Unsatisfied with Cavanaugh's screenplay, Hitchcock then hired up-and-coming writer [[Joseph Stefano]] to adapt the novel. The film began shooting in December 1959 and would go on to last about a month. It was filmed mostly on the backlot of Universal and in various sound stages. During shooting, Hitchcock was forced to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Miles hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref> The famous shower scene took a week to complete and took up a third of Janet Leigh's shooting time. ''Psycho'' was released on June 16, 1960 to mixed critical reception and financial success, making thirty-two million dollars in its theatrical run. The film received four Academy Award nominations.\n\nIn 1982, author Robert Bloch published his novel ''Psycho II'', which satirized Hollywood slasher films. Upset by this, Universal decided to make their own version that differed from Bloch's work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://mgpfeff.home.sprynet.com/leming_interview1.html | title=Interviews - From ''Psycho'' to ''Asylum'': The Horror Films of Robert Bloch | work=The Unofficial Robert Bloch Website | accessdate=2009-08-15}}</ref> Originally, the film was intended as a [[TV movie|made-for-cable]] production.<ref name=boys>[http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ A Boy's Best Friend - Psycho 2 - Retroslashers.net] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130112034832/http://retroslashers.net/blog/a-boys-best-friend-pt2-psycho-2-1983/ |date=2013-01-12 }}</ref> [[Anthony Perkins]] originally turned down the offer to reprise the role of [[Norman Bates]], but when the studio became interested in others (including [[Christopher Walken]]), Perkins quickly accepted.<ref name=film>[http://www.film.com/movies/psycho-ii/story/erics-time-capsule-psycho-ii/28477842 Eric's Time Capsule: Psycho II (June 3, 1983) - Film.com]</ref> The studio also wanted [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] (daughter of ''Psycho'' star [[Janet Leigh]]) to play the role of Mary Loomis.<ref name=film/> Director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] was hired to direct ''Psycho II'' because he was a Hitchcock student and even visited him on the set of ''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'', and because a year earlier, Franklin made a film called ''[[Roadgames]]'' starring Jamie Lee Curtis which was influenced by Hitchcock's 1954 film ''[[Rear Window]]''. Franklin hired writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]] to write the screenplay after Franklin had seen ''The Beast Within'', which Holland had written. Holland stated: \"I approached it with more trepidation because I was doing a sequel to ''Psycho'' and I had an overwhelming respect for Hitchcock. You didn't want to mess it up, you really had almost a moral obligation to make something that stayed true to the original and yet updated it the same time. It really was the next step, what happens when Norman gets out\". The assistant director of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', [[Hilton A. Green]], was contacted and asked if he wanted to produce the film. Green, fearing that Hitchcock may not have approved of sequels to his films, called Hitchcock's daughter [[Patricia Hitchcock]] and asked what she thought of the film. Patricia Hitchcock gave her blessing to the film, saying that her father would have loved it. ''Psycho II'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Universal City, California]] on Stage 24 from June 30, 1982 to August 1982.<ref name=boys/>\n\nThe Bates house set was still standing from 1960, but the motel had to be reconstructed.<ref name=boys/> According to [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]], filming lasted 32 days. The film was made much like the first film; it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and on a number of sound stages. Several props and set pieces from the original film were found by set designers [[John W. Corso]] and Julie Fletcher. The town of Fairvale (seen when Lila Loomis is tailed by Dr. Raymond) is actually [[Courthouse Square]], which is located on the Universal Studios backlot in [[California]]. Both Franklin and Holland wanted the film to be a tribute to Hitchcock and the original film; to accomplish this, they added in various in jokes such as the scene when Mary and Norman first go into Norman's mother's room, before they turn the lights on; one can see Alfred Hitchcock's silhouette on the wall to the far right. Franklin also repeated various shots from the original film such as the shot where Norman walks into the kitchen and sets his jacket down on the chair. Perkins had difficulty working with actress [[Meg Tilly]] due to Tilly never seeing the original film and not being aware of the significance of Perkins' comeback role. Midway through production, Perkins suggested that Tilly be replaced even though half of her scenes had been shot. The ending of the film was kept secret during production. The final pages of the shooting script with the ending on it weren't distributed to cast and crew until the last day of filming. The iconic last shot of the movie with Norman standing in front of the house was used as a Christmas card for various crew members. When Universal presented concept art for the one-sheet film poster, director Franklin wasn't pleased with it. It was editor Andrew London who came up with the idea of using the Christmas card photo as the film poster and also came up with the tagline: \"It's 22 years later and Norman Bates is coming home\". When the film opened on June 3, 1983, it earned $8,310,244 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $34,725,000, making it one of the top hits of the year, just behind ''[[Return of the Jedi]]''.<ref name=boys/>\n\n''Psycho II'' was generally received well by the public and critics and was a surprise box office success. However, film critics [[Gene Siskel]] and [[Roger Ebert]] both gave the film thumbs down on ''[[At the Movies (1982\u20131990 TV series)|At the Movies]]'', specifically for its failure to live up to the original. \"I think the ghost of the original,\" said Siskel, \"obviously hangs over this movie, and it's too bad because it's a nicely made picture.\" Ebert wrote of the film: \"If you've seen ''Psycho'' a dozen times and can recite the shots in the shower scene by heart, ''Psycho II'' is just not going to do it for you. But if you can accept this 1983 movie on its own terms, as a fresh start, and put your memories of Hitchcock on hold, then ''Psycho II'' begins to work. It's too heavy on plot and too willing to cheat about its plot to be really successful, but it does have its moments, and it's better than your average, run-of-the-mill slasher movie.\"<ref name=\"ebert\">{{Cite news|author=Ebert, Roger |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Psycho (1960) |work=Great Movies |publisher=rogerebert.com |date=1998-12-06 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19981206/REVIEWS08/401010353/1023|accessdate=2006-12-01}}</ref> In the British magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', film critic [[Kim Newman]] gave the film three out of five stars, calling ''Psycho II'' \"a smart, darkly-comic thriller with some imaginative twists\", writing \" The wittiest dark joke is that the entire world ''wants'' Norman to be mad, and \u2018normality\u2019 can only be restored if he\u2019s got a mummified mother in the window and is ready to kill again.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Newman|first=Kim|title=Empire's Psycho II Movie Review|url=https://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134907|publisher=Empire|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the surprise financial and critical success of ''Psycho II'', Universal began development on a second sequel. Writer [[Charles Edward Pogue]] was hired to write the screenplay. In Pogue's first draft of the film, it was Duane who was the killer and had intentionally come to the Bates Motel because he was obsessed with Norman. Maureen was a neurotic psychologist who had come to the motel to replace Dr. Raymond from the previous film. Pogue had intended to cast original victim [[Janet Leigh]] in the role. Universal rejected these ideas, arguing that Bates had to be the killer and Leigh was wrong for the film. However, Maureen's actions remained virtually unchanged; her character was merely changed to a young nun. After the second draft of the screenplay was completed, it was sent to Perkins as an acting job. After Perkins read the script, he wanted to direct the film, saying he would do it for nothing. Universal agreed to this. When the film went into pre-production, Anthony Perkins asked ''Psycho II'' director [[Richard Franklin (director)|Richard Franklin]] to co-direct the film with him; however Franklin declined. Filming for ''Psycho III'' began in June 1985. Perkins' main inspiration for the style of this film came from the movie ''[[Blood Simple]]'' directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. Before production began, he even took the entire cast and crew to a screening of the film. Like the two previous films, it was mostly shot on the backlot of Universal and in a number of sound stages. Despite ''Psycho III'' being Perkins' film directorial debut, the cast and crew have said in interviews that he was enjoyable to work with. [[Lee Garlington]], who played the waitress Myrna, stated: \"I have never to this date met a director who worked equally well with both the cast and crew. He was excited to be doing it, I adored him\". During filming, actor [[Jeff Fahey]] suffered an on-set injury. When filming the scene where Norman is hitting Duke with the guitar, Anthony Perkins actually hit Jeff Fahey so hard that it cut his head open and he had to get six stitches. A shot of Fahey's actual injury was used in the final film. Universal originally wanted to release the film in February 1986 but the release was moved to July 2, 1986 due to various re-shoots that included the ending. ''Psycho III'' was released on July 2, 1986 to a mixed response from critics and financial failure. It earned $3,238,400 in its opening weekend and went on to gross about $14,481,606 at the domestic box office, becoming the lowest-grossing theatrical film of the ''Psycho'' movie franchise.<ref name=\"mojo-p3\">{{cite web |url= https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=psycho3.htm |title= Psycho III |website = [[Box Office Mojo]] |access-date= 2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film three out of five stars, saying: \"Any movie named \"Psycho III\" is going to be compared to the Hitchcock original, but Perkins isn't an imitator. He has his own agenda. He has lived with Norman Bates all these years, and he has some ideas about him, and although the movie doesn't apologize for Norman, it does pity him. For the first time, I was able to see that the true horror in the \"Psycho\" movies isn't what Norman does - but the fact that he is compelled to do it.\" Vincent Canby of ''The New York Times'' said: \"It has a cast of talented, self-effacing actors, who don't upstage the material, and an efficient screenplay by Charles Edward Pogue, who doesn't beat you over the head to prove that he has a sense of humor.\" Ken Hanke of Mountain Xpress called the film a \"superior horror sequel stylishly made by star Anthony Perkins\". Dave Kehr of ''The Chicago Reader'' said: \"Perkins tries to imitate Hitchcock's visual style, but most of the film is made without concern for style of any kind, unless it's the bludgeoning nonstyle of Friday the 13th.\" ''Variety'' called the film \"dependent almost entirely upon self-referential incidents and attitudes for its effect, and it eventually becomes wearying.\"\n\nWith the financial failure of ''Psycho III'', Universal decided to continue the ''Psycho'' franchise as a television series, taking inspiration from the ''[[Friday the 13th (TV series)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[Freddy's Nightmares|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' TV series. In this televised [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''Psycho'', Norman Bates is portrayed by [[Kurt Paul]], who previously stood in as a [[stunt double]] for Anthony Perkins in ''Psycho II'' and ''Psycho III''. Perkins declined involvement in the project and even heavily boycotted it. The film was made as a [[pilot episode|pilot]] for a weekly anthology television series, but the series was never picked up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092622/trivia|title=Trivia for Bates Motel|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=2011-04-17}}</ref> Thus, Universal decided to air the pilot as a made-for-TV film over the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] weekend. The film received mostly negative reviews and low Nielson ratings.\n\nA year after ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' aired, production on ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' began. Perkins wanted to direct the film and even came up with a pitch for the film along with ''Psycho III'' screenwriter Charles Edward Pogue; however ''Psycho III'' was a critical and financial failure so Universal rejected that idea and [[Mick Garris]] was brought in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/54/psychoiv.php |title=Who Owns Norman Bates? |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=November 2006 |work= |publisher=Bright Lights Film Journal |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> [[Joseph Stefano]] was the screenwriter of the original film and was brought back to write the fourth film. He had disliked the two films between I and IV, feeling that they were too commercial and catered to the conventions of slasher movies. In an interview, Stefano stated \"Gearing up for ''Psycho IV'', I decided to ignore the two sequels \u2013 like the business in II about Norman\u2019s mother.\"<ref>[http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2008/09/interview-psycho-screenwriter-joseph-stefano/ Interview: Psycho Screenwriter Joseph Stefano By Steve Biodrowski \u2022 September 16, 2008]</ref>\n\nActress [[Olivia Hussey]] was directly offered the role of Mrs. Bates.

In the documentary ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'', Thomas stated: \"Looking back on it now, he knew he had to have this conversation with me but I don't think that he was really into it. He just gave me a few broad strokes and told me to play the character real, that was it.\"<ref>{{cite video |people=Robert V.

Director Mick Garris has stated in numerous interviews that he had some creative control issues with Perkins. \"He would get into long, drawn-out discussions in front of the crew, testing his director, making sure choices were not made \"because it looks good\", and seeing how deep the understanding of the story and process were. He could be very forceful, just shy of bullying, but also really appreciated helpful direction. I would have to say he was the most difficult and challenging actor I've ever worked with, but he ended up going on and on about how happy he was with the film. That was gratifying\", Garris says.<ref>[http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html Interview with Director Mick Garris at \"The Psycho Movies\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401083024/http://www.thepsychomovies.com/films/psycho4/mgarris.html |date=2012-04-01 }}</ref>\n\n''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' was filmed at [[Universal Studios Florida]] in [[Orlando, Florida]] from June 4 to July 13, 1990. The facade of the Bates Motel and the Bates mansion were re-created at the theme park. The production was originally to be filmed before the opening of the park but due to delays and the studio's desire to have a high-profile production on the lot, the film was shot while the park was open. This led to tourists being able to watch the filming of several scenes at the motel and house on the back lot.\n\nThe film received mixed reviews when first broadcast on Showtime. Henry Stewart of ''L Magazine'' said: \"Garris evinces high-grade professionalism, but his comic-book approximations of real emotions\u2014like desire, madness and murderlust\u2014feel empty. Hitchcock this most certainly ain't.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/newyork/psycho-the-book-the-sequels/Content?oid=1794136 |title=Psycho, the Book, the Sequels |author=Mark Asch and Henry Stewart |date= |work= |publisher=The L Magazine |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Ninja Dixon.com stated: \"This is a good TV movie, way better than {{sic|it's}} reputation, and continues the tradition of great acting in the series.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ninjadixon.blogspot.com/2009/08/psycho-iv-beginning-1990.html |title=Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) |author=Ninja Dixon |date=August 6, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}</ref> Cult Reviews.com said: \"The film is shot well, the fire sequence, by Rodney Charters, is particularly stunning.

Some changes are pervasive: as the film opens, it is made clear that it is set in the late 1990s, so minor changes are made throughout the dialogue to reflect the new timeframe. For example, all the references to money are updated (how much Marion Crane steals, how much a car costs, how much a hotel room costs), as are references to terms from the original script like \"[[aspic]]\" that would seem [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] in the new setting.\n\nAccording to Van Sant, in the original the only fully fleshed-out character was [[Norman Bates]]; the other major characters were more iconic, purposely written and portrayed to advance the plot. Van Sant relied upon his main cast more to flesh out and make consistent their character's motivations and worked with them to determine to what degree their characters were similar to the originals. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the original, while others, such as Vaughn and Julianne Moore, interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently. Moore's version of Lila Crane was much more aggressive than the one portrayed by [[Vera Miles]], and there are differences in Marion Crane's evolving attitudes about the money she stole.\n\nThe [[cinematography]] and [[cinematic techniques]] were consistent between the two films in many memorable scenes, including the shower scene, scenes of the mother, scenes of the swamp, and the scene of Arbogast on the staircase, but other scenes changed significantly, particularly the climax, and the Dr. Simon monologue at the end, which was much shorter. Van Sant's comments from the commentary track attributes many of the updates to the need to make the film more accessible to a new audience.\n\nThe film earned $37,141,130 at the box office, $21,456,130 of which came from North America.<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\">{{mojo title|id=psycho98|title=Psycho (1998)}}</ref> Estimates of the production budget range from $20 million<ref>[https://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1998/PSYCH.php ''Psych'' (1998)] from The Numbers</ref> to $60 million;<ref name=\"mojo-p1998\"/> while promoting his 2002 film ''[[Gerry (2002 film)|Gerry]]'', Van Sant said he thought the producers \"broke even\" financially.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/movies/gus-van-sant-int.htm| title=Gus Vant Sant: Exclusive Interview| last=Morris| first=Clint| publisher=Web Wombat| accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThis version of ''Psycho'' received mostly negative reviews; it was awarded two [[Golden Raspberry Award]]s, for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel|Worst Remake or Sequel]] and [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director|Worst Director]] for Gus Van Sant, while Anne Heche was nominated as [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress|Worst Actress]].

Many people refer to this film as a duplicate of the [[Psycho (1960 film)|1960 film]] rather than a remake.

''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998), a shot-for-shot [[remake]] of the first film is not a sequel since it retells the same events as the original film, but set in 1998. There are also some continuity problems in ''Psycho IV: The Beginning'' that have to do with some of the past events explored in ''Psycho'', ''Psycho II'', and ''Psycho III''. Reflecting on the continuity issues, Robert Price writes \"It seems that all the different Psychos drift into and out of one another. There is no real sequence. All are variant versions of the same myth.

All three sequels have been nominated for Saturn Awards. ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'' received a nomination for Best Screenplay for writer [[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]. ''[[Psycho III]]'' was nominated for Best Horror Film. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' was nominated for Best Genre Television Series.\n\n===Legacy===\n''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' has become one of the most recognizable films ever made. The shower scene alone has become one of the most iconic cut scenes in cinematic history. ''Psycho'' is frequently referenced, given homage to or spoofed in television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[American Dad!]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' and more. Films such as ''[[Scream 2]]'', ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', ''[[Throw Momma from the Train]]'', ''[[Scary Movie]]'' and more have referenced the film. Many critics and filmmakers have cited ''Psycho'' as the film that modernized the horror genre. Horror writer David. J. Schow stated (in ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'') \"It brought the idea that the killer in a horror film was not a mutant, didn't have dents in his head; he could look like that nice young boy from next door\". The film also brought in a new level of acceptable violence and sexuality in movies. Both [[Anthony Perkins]] and [[Janet Leigh]] spent the rest of their careers being typecasted by the film. Even [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s films began to decline in critical and financial popularity after the release of ''Psycho''. Hitchcock film scholars argue that for the rest of his career, Hitchcock's films were constantly being compared to ''Psycho''. The \"Psycho\" films still maintain a very large fanbase. Various websites dedicated to the franchise such as ''The Psycho Movies.com'' have appeared on the Internet. Books detailing the making and impact of the film such as ''Alfred Hitchcock and The Making of Psycho'', ''The Moment of Psycho'', Janet Leigh's ''Psycho: Behind The Scenes of the Classic Thriller'' have been published over the years. Two retrospective documentaries have been released detailing the making of all four films including ''The Making of Psycho'' (1997) and ''[[The Psycho Legacy]]'' (2010). The film also spawned the show ''[[Alfred Hitchcock: The Art of Making Movies]]'' at [[Universal Studios Florida]], with part of the show detailing how the shower scene was filmed. In 1992, ''Psycho'' was added to the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nA musical stage adaptation was performed January-February 2019 at PULP Black Box Theatre in Atlanta, GA. <ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/1973956552682770/</ref>\n\n==Other media and merchandise==\n\nVarious ''Psycho'' related merchandise has been sold ever since the release of the original film. Merchandise includes T-shirts, posters, DVDs, books, stationery, shot glasses, shower curtains, action figures, model house kits, pens and more. Much of the merchandise is related to the fictional Bates Motel where items commonly found in an actual motel have the Bates Motel logo on them. A Bates Motel light up sign was released in 2009. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film, a Psycho house model kit was released in the U.S. Props from all the films are also sold occasionally on [[eBay]]. The original one sheet poster for ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' is worth around $3000 in mint condition. The original one sheets for ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' are worth around $50 each.\n\n===Graphic novels===\nIn 1992, a series of [[graphic novel]]s based on the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' was published by the Innovation Comics group. Today, the novels are out of print and are very rare to find.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===The ''Psycho'' House and Bates Motel sets===\nThe Bates House and Motel were constructed on the backlot at Universal City Studios in 1959 for the production of ''Psycho''. It has been said that the house, designed by art director's Joseph Hurley and Robert Clathworthy, was loosely based on an Edward Hopper painting called \"House by the Railroad\". The house and motel sets were actually empty shells, also known as facades. When the house was originally built, there was no right side of the house, since the right side is never seen on camera in the original ''Psycho'' film. Interiors of the Bates house and motel were constructed on Sound stage 18-A at Universal, just a short walk from the actual exterior locations making production convenient for all involved. After production had wrapped on ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', the house was featured in several television productions including ''The Virginian'' and ''Boris Karloff's Mystery Theater''.\n\nIn 1964, Universal Studios opened its patented Studio Tram Tour. The right side of the house was then added and the set was unceremoniously dubbed \"The Psycho House\". The house and even the motel went on to appear in several shows such as ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys]]'' and even in films such as ''[[Invitation to a Gunfighter]]'' and ''[[Modern Problems]]''. The motel was torn down in 1979 and the house was moved to an alternate location on the backlot to accommodate the new tour. In 1982, Richard Franklin and Hilton A. Green announced plans to film ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]''. The house was then moved to a location that best matched the original hill and only about 40 feet of the motel was actually re-built. The rest of the motel in the film was a matte painting. TV shows during the '80s promoted the Universal Tour and prominently featured the Psycho House including ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]'', and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''.\n\nIn 1985, the Bates Motel was fully re-built for the filming of ''[[Psycho III]]''. In 1987, the NBC-TV network announced plans for the TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]''. The motel in the film was re-modeled to look very Spanish like. This version of the set remained until 1994 when the new renovations were taken away and the motel was put back to look the way it did in the original Psycho. An episode of ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' from the early 1990s featured the Psycho House and Bates Motel as key locations in the popular Angela Lansbury series.\n\nIn 1988, plans for ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' were underway at Universal. Plans to shoot the movie in Orlando, Florida were set into motion and the film crew constructed a full-scale replica of the Bates Motel and Psycho House at the soon-to-be built Universal Studios Florida. The final dressing and painting was done by the Psycho IV art department crew in 1990, but the house and motel was fully built in 1988 long before the production team was assembled for the project. After production wrapped, the sets were left as attractions at the park until 1999 when it was torn down to make room for another attraction.\n\nIn 1998, the Psycho House in California was renovated to preserve the set. All of the rotting wood was replaced and the set had a new paint job. That same year, plans to remake ''Psycho'' were announced. It was originally announced that Gus Van Sant was going to be using the original house and motel sets. However, the production team built a new house directly in front of the old one, and the motel was updated to look like it was from the 1960s. The new house was moved next to the original house and remained there for about three years after production. In 2003, due to popular demand, the remake's house was torn down and the motel was restored to the original way once again. To this day, the house and motel are still standing on the backlot of Universal and continue to be major tourist attractions. The [[Studio Tour|tram tour]] features an actor playing Norman Bates coming out of cabin 1 with a body, putting it in the trunk of a car and then wielding a large knife at the tourists as the tram drives away.\n\n===''24 Hour Psycho''===\nAn art installation, ''[[24 Hour Psycho]]'', created by artist [[Douglas Gordon]] in 1993, and later installed in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, consists of a silent screening of ''Psycho'', slowed down to two frames per second (from the usual 24), so that it lasts 24 hours rather than 109 minutes. ''24 Hour Psycho'' is featured prominently in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 2010 novel ''[[Point Omega]]''.\n\n===''The Psycho Legacy'' (2010)===\n{{Main|The Psycho Legacy}}\nIn 2010, a direct-to-DVD documentary was released called ''The Psycho Legacy''. It included interviews with cast and crew from all four Psycho films. It also featured interviews with current horror filmmakers who are fans of the series. The documentary was written, produced and directed by horror journalist Robert Galluzzo. Galluzo made the documentary because of the lack of information on the sequels and also to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the release of the original film. The documentary discussed the impact and legacy of the original ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and the production stories of ''[[Psycho II (film)|Psycho II]]'', ''[[Psycho III]]'' and ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]''. To the surprise of some critics and fans, the failed TV pilot ''[[Bates Motel (film)|Bates Motel]]'' and the [[Gus Van Sant]] [[Psycho (1998 film)|remake]] were not discussed in the documentary, however originally in the deleted scenes section on the DVD two short segments on the two films were supposed to be on there, however for unknown reasons they were left off of the DVD when it was released. The documentary sold well, received mostly positive reviews and garnered new interest in the series from horror fans.\n\n===''Hitchcock'' (2012)===\n{{Main|Hitchcock (film)}}\nOn April 13, 2012, production started on a film adaptation of [[Stephen Rebello]]'s non-fiction book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]'', which follows the complex relationship between [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and wife [[Alma Reville]] during the filming of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' in 1959. The film is directed by [[Sacha Gervasi]] and stars [[Anthony Hopkins]] as director Alfred Hitchcock, Helen Mirren as his wife [[Alma Reville]], [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]], [[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]], and [[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]. Produced by [[The Montecito Picture Company]] and distributed by [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]], the film was released on November 23, 2012 in selected cities with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and moderate box office returns, with a worldwide gross of $5,337,378 as of January 3, 2013.\n\n===2017 documentary: \"78/52\"===\n\nA documentary on the production of ''Psycho'' was released on Oct 13, 2017 by director Alexandre O. Philippe running 91 minutes. The cast of participants included Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.<ref>. {{cite web | date = January 24, 2017 | author = Owen Gleiberman | url = https://variety.com/2017/film/reviews/7852-review-psycho-1201966555/ | title = Film Review: \u201878/52: Hitchcock\u2019s Shower Scene\u2019 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]] }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Janet Leigh|Leigh, Janet]]; Nickens, Christopher (1995).

They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]).

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside.

As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation of Pepin===\n{{main|Donation of Pepin}}\nWhen the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'\u00c9glise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>\n\nIn practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.\n\nOver several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.\n\n===Avignon Papacy===\n{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}\n\n[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]\n\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings.

The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of [[Cola di Rienzo]], who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347,{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=225}} and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power.{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}} As Prof. [[Guido Ruggiero]] states, \"even with the support of [[Petrarch]], his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.\"{{sfn|Ruggiero|2014|page=227}}\n\nThe Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Cardinal Albornoz]], who was appointed papal legate, and his [[condottieri]] heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]]. The last holdouts against full papal control were [[Giovanni Manfredi]] of Faenza and [[Francesco II Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816.

In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.\n\nPapal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe [[Reformation]] began in 1517.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2014 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.\n\n===Napoleonic era===\n[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}\n\nTwo years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798). [[Pope Pius VI]] fled to [[Siena]], and died in exile in Valence (France) in 1799.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} The [[French Consulate]] restored the Papal States in June 1800 and the newly-elected [[Pope Pius VII]] took up residency in Rome, but the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] invaded in 1808, and this time on 17 May 1809, the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France,{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}} forming the ''[[d\u00e9partement]]s'' of ''[[Tibre]]'' and ''[[Trasim\u00e8ne]]''.\n\nFollowing the fall of the Napoleonic system in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] officially restored the Italian territories of the Papal States (but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon) to Vatican control.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}\n\nFrom 1814 until the death of [[Pope Gregory XVI]] in 1846, the popes followed a [[reactionary]] policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\n[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.\n\nThe nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.\n\nAs a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons.

This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}\n\nDespite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.\n\n==Papal military==\nHistorically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>\nIn 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.\n\nA small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Catholicism|Italy}}\n* [[Captain General of the Church]]\n* [[Donation of Constantine]]\n* [[History of Rome]]\n* [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Italian unification]]\n* [[Italian United Provinces]]\n* [[Law of Guarantees]]\n* [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]\n* [[Roman Question]]\n* [[War of the Eight Saints]]\n* [[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n* [[Papal Navy]]\n* [[Papal Zouaves]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=States of the Church}}\n* Chambers, D.S. 2006.

They were among the major [[Historical states of Italy|states of Italy]] from roughly the 8th century until the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] successfully [[Unification of Italy|unified the Italian Peninsula]] by conquest in a campaign virtually concluded in 1861 and definitively in 1870. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of [[Lazio]] (which includes [[Rome]]), [[Marche]], [[Umbria]] and [[Romagna]], and portions of [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]]. These holdings were considered to be a manifestation of the [[Temporal power (papal)|temporal power of the pope]], as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy.\n\nBy 1861, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the pope's temporal control. In 1870, the pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of St Peter]] and [[Apostolic Palace|the papal residence]] and related buildings around the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican quarter]] of Rome, which the new Italian state did not occupy militarily.  In 1929 the head of the Italian government, at the time the [[Italian Fascist]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]], ended the [[Prisoner in the Vatican|crisis between unified Italy and the Holy See]] by negotiating the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed by the two parties. This recognized the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]] over a newly created international territorial entity, the [[Vatican City]] State, limited to a [[Tokenism#In politics|token territory]].\n\n==Name==\nThe Papal States were also known as the ''Papal State'' (although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere [[personal union]]). The territories were also referred to variously as the ''State(s) of the Church'', the ''Pontifical States'', the ''Ecclesiastical States'', or the ''Roman States'' ({{lang-it|Stato Pontificio}}, also ''{{lang|it|Stato della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati della Chiesa}}'', ''{{lang|it|Stati Pontifici}}'', and ''{{lang|it|Stato Ecclesiastico}}''; {{lang-la|Status Pontificius}}, also ''{{lang|la|Dicio Pontificia}}'' \"papal rule\").<ref name=\"mitchell368\">{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=S.A. |title=Mitchell's geographical reader |publisher=Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. |page=[https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog/page/n274 368] |year=1840 |url=https://archive.org/details/mitchellsgeogra01mitcgoog }}</ref> To some extent the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.\n\n==History==\n{{further|History of Rome|History of the Papacy}}\n\n===Origins===\n{{main|Duchy of Rome|Patrimonium Sancti Petri}}\n\nFor its first 300 years the [[Catholic Church]] was persecuted and unrecognized, unable to hold or transfer property.<ref name=schnurer>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14257a.htm Schn\u00fcrer, Gustav. \"States of the Church.\"] ''Catholic Encyclopedia''.

Nonetheless, the properties held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be considered as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate \"heir\" of that property, often its senior [[deacon]]s, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony attached to the churches at Rome, and thus under its ruling bishop, became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but landed estates, such as [[latifundia]]s, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmavAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA243|title=A Political History of Early Christianity|last=Brent|first=Allen|date=2009-09-01|publisher=A&C Black|year=|isbn=9780567606051|location=|page=243|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis system began to change during the reign of the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine I]], who made Christianity legal within the Roman Empire, and restored to it any properties that had been confiscated (in the larger cities of the empire this would have been quite considerable, and the Roman patrimony not least among them).<ref name=schnurer/> The [[Lateran Palace]] was the first significant new donation to the Church, most probably a gift from Constantine himself.<ref name=schnurer/>\n\nOther donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. But the Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. When in the 5th century the Italian peninsula passed under the control of [[Odoacer]] and, later, the [[Ostrogoths]], the Church organization in Italy, with the [[pope]] at its head, submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole [[Catholic Church|Church]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe seeds of the Papal States as a sovereign political entity were planted in the 6th century. Beginning in 535, the [[Byzantine Empire]], under emperor [[Justinian I]], launched a [[Western Roman Empire#East Roman reconquest|reconquest]] of Italy that took decades and devastated Italy's political and economic structures. Just as these wars wound down, the [[Lombards]] entered the peninsula from the north and conquered much of the countryside. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from [[Ravenna]], where the Emperor's representative, or [[Exarch of Ravenna|Exarch]], was located, to Rome and south to Naples (the \"Rome-Ravenna corridor\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McEvedy|first1=Colin|title=The Penguin atlas of medieval history|date=1961|publisher=Penguin Books|page=32|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=rjHVAAAAMAAJ&q=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjlns3LrcHKAhVM1hQKHcgFBd84ChDoAQgrMAE|quote=... separated from their theoretical overlord in Pavia by the continuing Imperial control of the Rome-Ravenna corridor.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Charles|title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean|date=2014|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199651924|page=661|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UtMVAwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=The empire retained control only of Rome, Ravenna, a fragile corridor between them, ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Jeffrey|title=The Popes and the Papacy in the Early Middle Ages: 476-752|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1317678175|page=230|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Zod9AwAAQBAJ&dq=Rome-Ravenna+corridor&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|quote=In 749 Ratchis embarked on a bid to capture Perusia, the key to the Rome-Ravenna land corridor}}</ref>), plus coastal exclaves.{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|page=378}}\n\nWith effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that Byzantines were unable to project to the area around the city of Rome.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} While the popes remained Byzantine subjects, in practice the [[Duchy of Rome]], an area roughly equivalent to [[Lazio|modern-day Latium]], became an independent state ruled by the pope.{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=1060}}\n\nThe Church's independence, combined with popular support for the papacy in Italy, enabled various popes to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor; [[Pope Gregory II]] even [[excommunication|excommunicated]] Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] during the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Nevertheless, the pope and the exarch still worked together to control the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy took an ever-larger role in defending Rome from the Lombards, usually through [[diplomacy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} In practice, the papal efforts served to focus Lombard [[wiktionary:aggrandizement|aggrandizement]] on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries embodied in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] king [[Liutprand the Lombard|Liutprand]]'s ''[[Donation of Sutri]]'' (728) to [[Pope Gregory II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romeartlover.it/Civita3.html|title=Sutri|work=From Civitavecchia to Civita Castellana|accessdate=27 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Donation of Pepin===\n{{main|Donation of Pepin}}\nWhen the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] finally fell to the Lombards in 751,{{sfn|Kleinhenz|2004|page=324}} the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]]. In 751, [[Pope Zachary]] had [[Pepin the Short]] crowned king in place of the powerless  [[Merovingian]] figurehead king [[Childeric III]]. Zachary's successor, [[Pope Stephen II]], later granted Pepin the title ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|Patrician]] of the Romans''. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756. Pepin defeated the Lombards \u2013 taking control of northern Italy \u2013 and made a gift (called the [[Donation of Pepin]]) of the properties formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.\n\nIn 781, [[Charlemagne]] codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome was key, but the territory was expanded to include Ravenna, the [[Duchy of the Pentapolis]], parts of the [[Duchy of Benevento]], [[Tuscany]], [[Corsica]], [[Lombardy]] and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800, when [[Pope Leo III]] crowned Charlemagne as '[[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor of the Romans]]'.\n\n===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{see also|Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)}}\nThe precise nature of the relationship between the popes and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperors]] \u2013 and between the Papal States and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire]] \u2013 is disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the pope as their sovereign ruler, merely a part of the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise ''[[Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma]]'', or whether the Holy Roman Emperors were vicars of the pope (as a sort of Archemperor) ruling Christendom, with the pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.\n\nEvents in the 9th century postponed the conflict. The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed as it was subdivided among [[Charlemagne]]'s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy's prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century by a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Theophylacti]]. This period was later dubbed the [[Saeculum obscurum]] (\"dark age\"), and sometimes as the \"rule by harlots\".<ref>[[\u00c9mile Amann]] and Auguste Dumas, ''L'\u00e9glise au pouvoir des la\u00efques'', in Auguste Fliche and Victor Martin, eds. ''Histoire de l'\u00c9glise depuis l'origine jusqu'au nos jours'', vol. 7 (Paris 1940, 1948)</ref>\n\nIn practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified ''[[Rocca (architecture)|rocca]]''.\n\nOver several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] conquered northern Italy; [[Pope John XII]] crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the [[Diploma Ottonianum]], by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States.{{sfn|Tucker|2009|page=332}} Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Italy. As the [[Gregorian Reform]] worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the [[Hohenstaufen dynasty]], the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], the [[Treaty of Venice]] made official the independence of Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.\n\n===Avignon Papacy===\n{{Main|Avignon Papacy}}\n\n[[File:Central States of the Church c 1430.png|thumb|upright|The domain of the Papal States {{circa|lk=no|1430}}]]\n\nFrom 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of [[Avignon]], surrounded by [[Provence]] and under the influence of the French kings.

Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan and [[Giovanni Visconti (archbishop of Milan)|Giovanni Visconti]], he defeated [[Giovanni di Vico]], lord of Viterbo, moving against [[Galeotto Malatesta]] of Rimini and the [[Ordelaffi]] of Forl\u00ec, the [[Montefeltro]] of [[Urbino]] and the da Polenta of [[Ravenna]], and against the cities of [[Senigallia]] and [[Ancona]].

Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on April 29, 1357, promulgated the ''[[Constitutiones Sanct\u00e6 Matris Ecclesi\u00e6]]'', which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional 'liberties' with a uniform code of civil law. These ''Constitutiones Egidiane'' mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. [[Pope Urban V]] ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.{{sfn|Watanabe|2013|page=19}}\n\n[[File:RomaPalazzoQuirinale.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Quirinal Palace]], papal residence and home to the civil offices of the Papal States from the [[Renaissance]] until their annexation]]\n\n===Renaissance===\nDuring [[the Renaissance]], the papal territory expanded greatly, notably under the popes [[Alexander VI]] and [[Julius II]]. The pope became one of Italy's most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States was still only nominally controlled by the pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.\n\nPapal responsibilities were often (as in the early 16th century) in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/italy/milxpapalstate.html|title= History of the Papal States|work=World History at KDMLA|first=Alexander |last=Ganse|publisher=Korean Minjok Leadership Academy|accessdate=7 March 2013}}</ref> Julius II, the \"Warrior Pope\", fought on their behalf.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe [[Reformation]] began in 1517.

Throughout the 16th century virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent ducate under an illegitimate son of [[Pope Paul III]]. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the [[Duchy of Ferrara]] in 1598,{{sfn|Hanlon|2008|page=134}}{{sfn|Domenico|2002|page=85}} and the [[Duchy of Urbino]] in 1631.{{sfn|Gross|2004|page=40}}\n\nAt its greatest extent, in the 18th century, the Papal States included most of central Italy \u2014 [[Latium]], [[Umbria]], [[Marche]] and the [[Papal Legations|Legations]] of [[Ravenna]], [[Ferrara]] and [[Bologna]] extending north into the [[Romagna]]. It also included the small enclaves of [[Benevento]] and [[Pontecorvo]] in southern Italy and the larger [[Comtat Venaissin]] around [[Avignon]] in southern France.\n\n===Napoleonic era===\n[[File:Italy 1796.svg|thumb|Map of the Italian Peninsula in 1796, showing the Papal States before the [[Napoleonic wars]] changed the face of the peninsula.]]\n\nThe [[French Revolution]] affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 Revolutionary France annexed the [[Comtat Venaissin]] and [[Avignon]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States' northern territories{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}) were seized and became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]].{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}}\n\nTwo years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States and General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]] declared a [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]]{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page= 252}} (February 1798).

For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last [[Roman Ghetto|Jewish ghetto]] in Western Europe. The Papal States, in 1870, were the last countries to discontinue the practice of castrating young boys of musical promise, making them [[castrati]], who were in demand musically. There were hopes{{by whom|date=April 2018}} that this would change when [[Pope Pius IX]] (in office 1846-1878) succeeded Gregory XVI and began to introduce liberal reforms.\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Papal States under Pope Pius IX|Administrative subdivisions of the Papal States from 1816 to 1871}}\n[[File:Stato Pontificio 1818.jpg|thumb|upright|Bond of the Papal States, issued 9 December 1818.<ref>Alex Witula: TITOLI di STATO, p. 245, {{ISBN|978-88-95848-12-9}}</ref>]]\n[[Italian nationalism]] had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the [[Habsburg]]s and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], with the [[House of Savoy]] in Sardinia-Piedmont constituting the only independent Italian state. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to numerous revolts, which were suppressed by the intervention of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army.\n\nThe nationalist and liberal [[revolutions of 1848]] affected much of Europe, and in February 1849, a [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]] was declared,{{sfn|Roessler|Miklos|2003|page=149}} and the hitherto liberally-inclined [[Pope Pius IX]] had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1850 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government.\n\nAs a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Austro-Sardinian War of 1859]], Sardinia-Piedmont annexed Lombardy, while [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south.{{sfn|Fischer|2011|page=136}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abulafia|first1=David|title=The Mediterranean in History|date=2003|publisher=Getty Publication|isbn=978-0892367252|page=268|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=LrRzgSebSZMC&dq=Giuseppe+Garibaldi+overthrew+bourbon&hl=nl&source=gbs_navlinks_s|chapter=The Mediterranean as a battleground|quote=(...) under Giuseppe Garibaldi to overthrow the Neapolitan Bourbons.

This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed. In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Sardinia-Piedmont conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States and cemented its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the [[Latium]] and large areas northwest of Rome.\n\n[[File:BrecciaPortaPia.jpg|thumb|The Breach of Porta Pia, on the right, in 1870.]]\n\nA unified [[Kingdom of Italy]] was declared and in March 1861, the first Italian parliament, which met in [[Turin]], the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new Kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX. The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the [[Second French Empire]] at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)|Battle of Sedan]] deprived Rome of its French protector. King [[Victor Emmanuel II]] at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on September 10, 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General [[Raffaele Cadorna]], crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome. The Italian Army reached the [[Aurelian Walls]] on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the pope's tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than a token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the [[Capture of Rome#Breach of Porta Pia|Breach of Porta Pia]], in reality a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the papal forces to limit the defense of the city in order to avoid bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardiasvizzera.va/content/guardiasvizzera/en/storia/1870-fine-dello-stato-pontificio.html|title=History of the Pontifical Swiss Guard|accessdate=30 August 2016}}</ref> The [[Capture of Rome|city was captured]] on September 20, 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a [[plebiscite]] the following October. This marked the definite end of the Papal States.{{sfn|Hanson|2015|page=252}}\n\nDespite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the pope's aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 \"[[Law of Guarantees]]\" and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the pope to become an Italian subject. Instead the papacy confined itself (see [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]) to the [[Apostolic Palace]] and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the [[Leonine City]], on [[Vatican Hill]]. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations, since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy. In the 1920s, the papacy \u2013 then under [[Pius XI]] \u2013 renounced the bulk of the Papal States, and the [[Lateran Treaty]] with [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime .281922.E2.80.931943.29|Italy]] (then ruled by the [[National Fascist Party]] under [[Benito Mussolini]]{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}}) was signed on February 11, 1929,{{sfn|De Grand|2004|page=89}} creating the [[Vatican City|State of the Vatican City]], forming the sovereign territory of the [[Holy See]], which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.\n\n==Regional governors==\n[[File:I fratelli de charette de la contrie detti i moschettieri del papa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Papal Zouaves]] pose in 1869.]]\n\nAs the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included \"[[papal legate]]\", as in the former principality of [[Benevento]], or at [[Bologna]], in [[Romagna]], and the [[March of Ancona]];  and  \"[[papal delegate]]\", as in the former duchy of Pontecorvo and in the [[Campagne and Maritime Province]]. Other titles like \"Papal [[Vicar]]\", \"Vicar General\", and also several titles of nobility, such as \"count\" or even \"prince\" were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.\n\n==Papal military==\nHistorically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of [[Military volunteer|volunteers]] and [[mercenary|mercenaries]]. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (''Esercito Pontificio'' in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of [[Irish military diaspora|Irish volunteers]], plus artillery and [[dragoon]]s.<ref>{{cite book|first=Massimo |last=Brandani| page =6|title= L'Esercito Pontificio da Castelfidardo a Porta Pia|year= 1976|publisher=Intergest |location=Milan}}</ref>\nIn 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called [[Papal Zouaves]] after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]]'s [[redshirts (Italy)|Redshirts]], Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.<ref>Charles A. Coulombe, ''The Pope's Legion: The Multinational Fighting Force that Defended the Vatican'', Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2008</ref>\n\nThe Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the [[Palatine Guard]], which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by [[Pope Paul VI]];{{sfn|Levillain|2002|page=1095}} the [[Noble Guard]], which also disbanded in 1970; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]], which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the pope's protective force.\n\nA small [[Papal Navy]] was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870 the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold on the death of Pius IX.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Catholicism|Italy}}\n* [[Captain General of the Church]]\n* [[Donation of Constantine]]\n* [[History of Rome]]\n* [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n* [[Italian unification]]\n* [[Italian United Provinces]]\n* [[Law of Guarantees]]\n* [[Prisoner in the Vatican]]\n* [[Roman Question]]\n* [[War of the Eight Saints]]\n* [[Index of Vatican City-related articles]]\n* [[Papal Navy]]\n* [[Papal Zouaves]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Catholic|wstitle=States of the Church}}\n* Chambers, D.S. 2006.

The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.\n\n===Urartu===\n[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]\n[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]\n\nUnder the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.\n\nThe name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Armenia===\nThe region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies \u2013 Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>\n\n===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===\n{{Main|Vaspurakan}}\nFollowing the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1\u20135 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.\n\n===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===\n{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}\nThe first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia.

During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>\n\n====Demographics====\nThe demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>\n\nThe demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G.

The Tilkitepe Mound, which is on the shores of Lake Van and a few kilometres to the south of [[Van Castle]], is the only source of information about the oldest culture of Van.\n\n===Urartu===\n[[File:Xerxes Cuneiform Van.JPG|thumb|230px|[[Xerxes I's inscription at Van|Inscription of Xerxes the Great]] on the cliffs below [[Van Fortress|Van castle]].]]\n[[File:Akhtamar Island on Lake Van with the Armenian Cathedral of the Holy Cross.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Lake Van]]]]\n\nUnder the ancient name of ''[[Tushpa]]'', Van was the capital of the [[Urartu|Urartian kingdom]] in the 9th century BC. The early settlement was centered on the steep-sided bluff now known as [[Van Castle]] (''Van Kalesi''), close to the edge of Lake Van and a few kilometers west of the modern city. Here have been found Urartian [[cuneiform]] inscriptions dating to the 8th and 7th centuries BC. In the trilingual [[Behistun]] [[inscription]], carved in the order of [[Darius the Great]] of [[Persia]], the country referred to as ''[[Urartu]]'' in Babylonian is called ''[[Armenia]]'' in Old Persian.\n\nThe name 'Van' comes from the [[Urartian language|Urartian]] ''Biaina''.<ref>Edmund Herzig, Marina Kurkchiyan, ''The Armenians: Past And Present In The Making Of National Identity'', p. 31</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Armenia===\nThe region came under the control of the [[Orontid dynasty|Orontids]] in the 7th century BC and quickly later the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the mid 6th century BC. The [[Van Fortress]] located outside Van holds an inscribed stereotyped trilingual inscription of [[Xerxes the Great]] from the 5th century BC upon a smoothed section of the rock face, some {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=off}} above the ground near the fortress. The inscription survives in near perfect condition and is divided into three columns of 27 lines written in (from left to right) [[Old Persian]], [[Akkadian language|Babylonian]], and [[Elamite]]. In 331 BC, Van was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]] and after his death became part of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. By the early 2nd century BC it was part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. It became an important center during the reign of the [[Armenia]]n king, [[Tigranes II of Armenia|Tigranes II]], who founded the city of [[Tigranocerta|Tigranakert]] in the 1st century BC.<ref>The Journal of Roman Studies \u2013 Page 124 by Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies</ref> In the early centuries BC, it fell to the emerging [[Arsacid dynasty of Parthia]] until the 3rd century AD. However, it also fell once to the [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia]] in this timespan. In the ''[[History of Armenia (Movses Khorenatsi)|History of Armenia]]'' attributed to [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the city is called ''Tosp'', from Urartian ''Tushpa''.<ref>http://rbedrosian.com/Classic/kvan1.htm</ref>\n\n===Byzantines, Sassanids, and the Artsrunis===\n{{Main|Vaspurakan}}\nFollowing the fall of the Parthians and the emergence of the Neo-Persian Empire, better known as the [[Sassanian Empire]],<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sass/hd_sass.htm The Met Museum Website: The Sasanian Empire (224\u2013651 A.D.)]</ref> the town naturally fell into the possession of the latter. During the over 700 years lasting [[Roman-Persian Wars]], some of the wars razed at or around the location of modern-day Van. The [[Byzantine Empire]] briefly held the region from 628 to 640, following the victory in the climactic [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], after which it was invaded by the Muslim Arabs, who consolidated their conquests as the province of [[Arminiya]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9lHeh36S8ooC&pg=PT1462&lpg=PT1462&dq=arabs+consolidated+arminiya&source=bl&ots=POFYPrUuOa&sig=0j_GVrgMMeoHT6j4mQ9oKRxQ2fU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5-67O6rPRAhVKJCYKHc8wAlwQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=arabs%20consolidated%20arminiya&f=false The Cambridge Medieval History Series volumes 1\u20135 by Plantagenet Publishing, 2nd to last paragraph on the page linked to.

After their victory in 1071 at the [[battle of Manzikert]] the entire region fell under their control. After them, local Muslim rulers emerged, such as the [[Ahlatshahs]] and the [[Ayyubids]] (1207). For a 20-year period, Van was held by the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] until the 1240s when it was conquered by the [[Mongols]]. In the 14th century, Van was held by the [[Timurids]], followed subsequently by the Turkoman [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]] confederations.\n\n===Turco-Iranian rivalry and the Ottoman era===\n{{see also|Eyalet of Van|Vilayet of Van}}\nThe first half of the 15th century saw the Van region become a land of conflict as it was disputed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the neighboring Persian [[Safavid]] Empire. The Safavids captured Van in 1502, as it went naturally with all former territories of the Ak Koyunlu. The Ottomans took the city in 1515 following the climactic [[Battle of Chaldiran]] and held it for a short period. The Safavids retook it again in 1520 but the Ottomans gained an almost definite hold of it in 1548 during another Ottoman-Safavid War. Ottoman control over the town got confirmed in the 1555 [[Peace of Amasya]] which came as a result after the end of the war. They first made Van into a [[sanjak]] dependent on the [[Erzurum eyalet]], and later into a separate [[Van eyalet]] in about 1570. In 1602, the Safavids under king [[Abbas the Great]] recaptured Van alongside other swaths of lost territories in Eastern Anatolia. However, Ottoman control over it was at last now made final and definite in 1639 with the [[Treaty of Zuhab]].\n\n[[File:Wan_Tournefort.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Van from [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]]'s 1717 book ''Relation d'un voyage du Levant'']]\n[[File:The Rock and Walled City of Van (1893).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The rock and walled city of Van in 1893 by [[H.

During the period leading up to the breakup of the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were well represented in the local administration.<ref>Hewler, 39</ref>\n\n====Demographics====\nThe demographics of Ottoman Van are a debated and contentious point as they relate directly to claims of ownership by either side prior to the outbreak of World War I. For the city of Van itself it's estimated that it had 50,000 inhabitants prior to World War I, of whom 30,000 were Armenian and 20,000 were Muslims. Based on the official 1914 Ottoman Census the population of Van province consisted of 179,422 Muslims and 67,797 Armenians.<ref>Values as printed in the [[:File:Proportions des populations en Asie Mineure statistique officielle d1914.png|official statistics from 1914]].</ref> The Ottoman Census figures include only male citizens, excluding women and children. According to a more recent research, the corrected estimates for the Van province (including women and children) are: 313,000 Muslims, 130,000 Armenians, and 65,000 others, including [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]].<ref>Justin McCarthy: ''Muslims and Minorities.'' New York University Press, 1983, p. 110 f.</ref>\n\nThe demographics of Van are a greatly debated point, given the changing provincial borders. For example, in 1875 the province was divided; Van and Hakkari were separated, only to be rejoined in 1888, drastically changing the census numbers. Some writers argue that this merging was done to keep the Armenians from forming a majority.<ref>Hewsen, 35.</ref> In 1862 it was estimated that in Van there were 90,100 Christians (including [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]]) and 95,100 Muslims.<ref>[[Anahide Ter Minassian]]: \"The city of Van at the Turn of the Twentieth Century.\" In: Richard G.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Compact disc bird scarers.JPG|thumb|Old CDs hanging from a tree to scare birds from the crops.]]\nAfter the fall in popularity of CDs, old discs or failed CD-R have been repurposed, since the reflections of the sun on a moving plate may [[bird scarer|scare birds]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n* [[List of optical disc manufacturers]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings ([[CD-DA]]) but was later adapted for storage of data ([[CD-ROM]]). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage ([[CD-R]]), rewritable media ([[CD-RW]]), Video Compact Disc ([[VCD]]), Super Video Compact Disc ([[SVCD]]), [[Photo CD]], PictureCD, Compact Disc-Interactive ([[CD-i]]), and [[Enhanced Music CD]]. The first commercially available audio [[CD player]], the [[Sony CDP-101]], was released October 1982 in [[Japan]].\n\nStandard CDs have a diameter of {{convert|120|mm}} and can hold up to about 80 minutes of uncompressed audio or about 700&nbsp;[[MiB]] of data. The [[Mini CD]] has various diameters ranging from {{convert|60|to|80|mm}}; they are sometimes used for CD singles, storing up to 24 minutes of audio, or delivering [[device driver]]s.\n\nAt the time of the technology's introduction in 1982, a CD could store much more data than a [[personal computer]] [[hard drive]], which would typically hold 10 MB. By 2010, hard drives commonly offered as much storage space as a thousand CDs, while their prices had plummeted to commodity level. In 2004, worldwide sales of audio CDs, CD-ROMs and CD-Rs reached about 30 billion discs. By 2007, 200 billion CDs had been sold worldwide.<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\"/>\n\nFrom the early 2000s, CDs were increasingly being replaced by other forms of digital storage and distribution, with the result that by 2010 the number of audio CDs being sold in the U.S. had dropped about 50 percent from their peak; however, they remained one of the primary distribution methods for the [[music industry]].<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\"/> In 2014, revenues from digital music services matched those from physical format sales for the first time.<ref>{{cite news|title=IFPI publishes Digital Music Report 2015|url=http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|access-date=1 July 2016|date=14 April 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414194629/http://www.ifpi.org/news/Global-digital-music-revenues-match-physical-format-sales-for-first-time|archivedate=14 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996.\n\nPhilips coined the term ''compact disc'' in line with another audio product, the [[Compact Cassette]],<ref name=peek/> and contributed the general [[manufacturing]] [[Industrial process|process]], based on video LaserDisc technology. Philips also contributed [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), while Sony contributed the [[error-correction]] method, [[Cross-Interleaved Reed-Solomon Coding|CIRC]], which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints.\n\nThe ''Compact Disc Story'',<ref name=\"Immink\"/> told by a former member of the task force, gives background information on the many technical decisions made, including the choice of the sampling frequency, playing time, and disc diameter.

Using a linear velocity of 1.2&nbsp;m/s and a narrower track pitch of 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m increases the playing time to 80 minutes, and data capacity to 700&nbsp;MiB.\n\n[[File:CD Pits at 6.25x Magnification.jpg|alt=This is a photomicrograph of the pits at the inner edge of a CD-ROM; 2-second exposure under visible fluorescent light.|thumb|The pits in a CD are 500 [[nanometre|nm]] wide, between 830 nm and 3,000 nm long and 150 nm deep.]]\nA CD is read by focusing a 780&nbsp;nm [[wavelength]] ([[near infrared]]) [[semiconductor laser]] through the bottom of the polycarbonate layer. The change in height between pits and lands results in a difference in the way the light is reflected. By measuring the reflection intensity change with a [[photodiode]], data is read from the disc. In order to accommodate the spiral pattern of data, the laser is placed on a mobile mechanism within the disc tray of any CD player. This mechanism typically takes the form of a sled that slides across a rail driven by a [[worm gear]], though some CD drives (particularly those manufactured by Philips during the 1980s and early 1990s) use a swing arm similar to that seen on a gramophone. This mechanism allows the laser to read information from the center to the edge of a disc without having to interrupt the spinning of the disc itself.\n\n[[File:CDM210 cd laufwerk.jpg|thumb|Philips CDM210 CD Drive]]\n\nThe pits and lands do ''not'' directly represent the 0's and 1's of [[binary data]]. Instead, [[non-return-to-zero, inverted]] encoding is used: a change from either pit to land or land to pit indicates a 1, while no change indicates a series of 0's. There must be at least two, and no more than ten 0's between each 1, which is defined by the length of the pit. This, in turn, is decoded by reversing the [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] used in mastering the disc, and then reversing the [[cross-interleaved Reed\u2013Solomon coding]], finally revealing the raw data stored on the disc. These encoding techniques (defined in the ''[[Compact Disc Digital Audio#Data encoding|Red Book]]'') were originally designed for [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD Digital Audio]], but they later became a standard for almost all CD formats (such as [[CD-ROM]]).\n\n=== Integrity ===\nCDs are susceptible to damage during handling and from environmental exposure. Pits are much closer to the label side of a disc, enabling defects and contaminants on the clear side to be out of focus during playback. Consequently, CDs are more likely to suffer damage on the label side of the disc. Scratches on the clear side can be repaired by refilling them with similar refractive plastic or by careful polishing. The edges of CDs are sometimes incompletely sealed, allowing gases and liquids to enter the CD and corrode the metal reflective layer and/or interfere with the focus of the laser on the pits, a condition known as [[disc rot]].<ref name=\"clir\">Council on Library and Information Resources: [http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html Conditions that Affect CDs and DVDs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160915012213/https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html |date=15 September 2016 }}</ref> The fungus ''[[Geotrichum candidum]]'' has been found\u2014under conditions of high heat and humidity\u2014to consume the polycarbonate plastic and aluminium found in CDs.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|title=Fungus eats CD|year=2001|journal=Nature|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044729/http://www.nature.com/news/1998/010628/full/news010628-11.html|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|title=Fungus 'eats' CDs|date=June 2001|publisher=BBC|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220948/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1402533.stm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Disc shapes and diameters ===\n[[File:Comparison disk storage.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Comparison of several forms of disk storage showing tracks (not-to-scale); green denotes start and red denotes end.<br/><nowiki>*</nowiki> Some CD-R(W) and DVD-R(W)/DVD+R(W) recorders operate in ZCLV, CAA or CAV modes.]]\n\nThe digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is {{convert|120|mm}} in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700&nbsp;MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity.

The document is known colloquially as the ''Red Book'' [[Compact Disc Digital Audio|CD-DA]] after the colour of its cover. The format is a two-channel 16-bit [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] encoding at a [[44.1 kHz|44.1&nbsp;kHz]] [[sampling rate]] per channel. [[Four-channel Compact Disc Digital Audio|Four-channel sound]] was to be an allowable option within the ''Red Book'' format, but has never been implemented. [[Monaural]] audio has no existing standard on a ''Red Book'' CD; thus, mono source material is usually presented as two identical channels in a standard ''Red Book'' stereo track (i.e., [[mono sound#Mirrored mono|mirrored mono]]); an [[MP3 CD]], however, can have audio file formats with mono sound.\n\n[[CD-Text]] is an extension of the ''Red Book'' specification for an audio CD that allows for the storage of additional text information (e.g., album name, song name, artist) on a standards-compliant audio CD. The information is stored either in the [[Optical disc authoring|lead-in area]] of the CD, where there is roughly five kilobytes of space available or in the [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R to W on the disc, which can store about 31 megabytes.\n\n[[Compact Disc + Graphics]] is a special audio compact disc that contains graphics data in addition to the audio data on the disc. The disc can be played on a regular audio CD player, but when played on a special CD+G player, it can output a graphics signal (typically, the CD+G player is hooked up to a television set or a computer monitor); these graphics are almost exclusively used to display lyrics on a television set for [[karaoke]] performers to sing along with. The CD+G format takes advantage of the channels R through W. These six bits store the graphics information.\n\n[[CD + Extended Graphics]] (CD+EG, also known as CD+XG) is an improved variant of the [[#CD + Graphics|Compact Disc + Graphics]] (CD+G) format. Like CD+G, CD+EG uses basic CD-ROM features to display text and video information in addition to the music being played. This extra data is stored in [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] channels R-W. Very few, if any, CD+EG discs have been published.\n\n=== Super Audio CD ===\n{{Main|Super Audio CD}}\nSuper Audio CD (SACD) is a high-resolution read-only [[optical disc|optical]] [[audio storage|audio disc]] format that was designed to provide [[high fidelity|higher-fidelity]] digital audio reproduction than the ''Red Book''. Introduced in 1999, it was developed by Sony and Philips, the same companies that created the ''Red Book''. SACD was in a [[format war]] with [[DVD-Audio]], but neither has replaced audio CDs. The SACD standard is referred to the ''Scarlet Book'' standard.\n\nTitles in the SACD format can be issued as hybrid discs; these discs contain the SACD audio stream as well as a standard audio CD layer which is playable in standard CD players, thus making them backward compatible.\n\n=== CD-MIDI ===\nCD-[[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] is a format used to store music-performance data, which upon playback is performed by electronic instruments that synthesize the audio. Hence, unlike the original ''Red Book'' CD-DA, these recordings are not digitally sampled audio recordings. The CD-MIDI format is defined as an extension of the original ''Red Book''.\n\n=== CD-ROM ===\n{{Main|CD-ROM}}\nFor the first few years of its existence, the CD was a medium used purely for audio. However, in 1988, the ''Yellow Book'' [[CD-ROM]] standard was established by Sony and Philips, which defined a non-volatile optical data [[computer data storage]] medium using the same physical format as audio compact discs, readable by a computer with a CD-ROM drive.\n\n=== Video CD (VCD) ===\n{{Main|Video CD}}\nVideo CD (VCD, View CD, and Compact Disc digital video) is a standard [[Digital data|digital]] format for storing video media on a CD. VCDs are playable in dedicated VCD players, most modern [[DVD-Video]] players, personal computers, and some video game consoles.\n\nThe VCD standard was created in 1993 by Sony, Philips, [[Panasonic|Matsushita]], and [[JVC]] and is referred to as the ''White Book'' standard.\n\nOverall picture quality is intended to be comparable to [[VHS]] video. Poorly compressed VCD video can sometimes be lower quality than VHS video, but VCD exhibits block artifacts rather than analog noise and does not deteriorate further with each use.\n\n352\u00d7240 (or [[Source Input Format|SIF]]) resolution was chosen because it is half the vertical and half the horizontal resolution of NTSC video. 352\u00d7288 is similarly one-quarter PAL/SECAM resolution. This approximates the (overall) resolution of an analog VHS tape, which, although it has double the number of (vertical) scan lines, has a much lower horizontal resolution.\n\n=== Super Video CD ===\n{{Main|Super Video CD}}\nSuper Video CD (Super Video Compact Disc or SVCD) is a format used for storing video media on standard compact discs. SVCD was intended as a successor to VCD and an alternative to DVD-Video and falls somewhere between both in terms of technical capability and picture quality.\n\nSVCD has two thirds the [[display resolution|resolution]] of DVD, and over 2.7 times the resolution of VCD. One CD-R disc can hold up to 60 minutes of standard-quality SVCD-format video. While no specific limit on SVCD video length is mandated by the specification, one must lower the video bit rate, and therefore quality, to accommodate very long videos. It is usually difficult to fit much more than 100 minutes of video onto one SVCD without incurring significant quality loss, and many hardware players are unable to play video with an instantaneous bit rate lower than 300 to 600 [[kilobit]]s per second.\n\n=== Photo CD ===\n{{Main|Photo CD}}\nPhoto CD is a system designed by [[Kodak]] for digitizing and storing photos on a CD. Launched in 1992, the discs were designed to hold nearly 100 high-quality images, scanned prints and slides using special proprietary encoding. Photo CDs are defined in the ''Beige Book'' and conform to the [[CD-ROM XA]] and CD-i Bridge specifications as well. They are intended to play on CD-i players, Photo CD players and any computer with suitable software (irrespective of [[operating system]]). The images can also be printed out on photographic paper with a special Kodak machine. This format is not to be confused with Kodak [[Picture CD]], which is a consumer product in CD-ROM format.\n\n=== CD-i ===\n{{Main|Philips CD-i}}\nThe Philips ''[[Green Book (CD standard)|Green Book]]'' specifies a standard for interactive multimedia compact discs designed for [[Philips CD-i|CD-i]] players (1993). CD-i discs can contain audio tracks that can be played on regular [[CD player]]s, but CD-i discs are not compatible with most [[CD-ROM]] drives and software. The [[CD-i Ready]] specification was later created to improve compatibility with audio CD players, and the [[CD-i Bridge]] specification was added to create CD-i compatible discs that can be accessed by regular CD-ROM drives.\n\n=== CD-i Ready ===\n{{Main|CD-i Ready}}\nPhilips defined a format similar to CD-i called [[CD-i Ready]], which puts CD-i software and data into the [[Pregap#Computer data in pregap|pregap]] of track 1. This format was supposed to be more compatible with older audio CD players.\n\n=== Enhanced Music CD (CD+) ===\n{{Main|Blue Book (CD standard)}}\nEnhanced Music CD, also known as CD Extra or CD Plus, is a format which combines [[CD-DA|audio tracks]] and [[CD-ROM|data tracks]] on the same disc by putting audio tracks in a first [[Session (CD)|session]] and data in a second session. It was developed by Philips and Sony, and it is defined in the ''[[Blue Book (CD standard)|Blue Book]]''.\n\n=== VinylDisc ===\n{{Main|VinylDisc}}\nVinylDisc is the hybrid of a standard audio CD and the [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]]. The vinyl layer on the disc's label side can hold approximately three minutes of music.\n\n== Manufacture ==\n{{Main|CD manufacturing}}\n[[File:Compact disk data layer 2d 3d.PNG|thumb|right|Individual pits are visible on the micrometre scale.]]\nIn 1995, material costs were 30 cents for the jewel case and 10 to 15 cents for the CD.

The incremental cost, though, to produce an MP3 is negligible.<ref>{{cite news |author=Amy HarmonPublished: 12 October 2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=MUSIC; What Price Music? |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=12 October 2003 |access-date=25 July 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512175059/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/arts/music-what-price-music.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |archivedate=12 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Writable compact discs ==\n\n=== Recordable CD ===\n[[File:Maxell CD-R 700MB 40x 20040321.jpg|thumb|700&nbsp;[[MiB]] CD-R next to a [[mechanical pencil]] for scale]]\n{{Main|CD-R}}\nRecordable Compact Discs, [[CD-R]]s, are injection-molded with a \"blank\" data spiral. A photosensitive dye is then applied, after which the discs are metalized and lacquer-coated. The write laser of the [[CD recorder]] changes the color of the dye to allow the read laser of a standard [[CD player]] to see the data, just as it would with a standard stamped disc. The resulting discs can be read by most CD-ROM drives and played in most audio CD players. CD-Rs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nCD-R recordings are designed to be permanent. Over time, the dye's physical characteristics may change causing read errors and data loss until the reading device cannot recover with error correction methods. The design life is from 20 to 100 years, depending on the quality of the discs, the quality of the writing drive, and storage conditions. However, testing has demonstrated such degradation of some discs in as little as 18 months under normal storage conditions.<ref name=\"AutoMR-14\"/><ref name=\"AutoMR-15\"/> This failure is known as [[disc rot]], for which there are several, mostly environmental, reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/sec5.html|title=5.

The write laser, in this case, is used to heat and alter the properties (amorphous vs. crystalline) of the alloy, and hence change its reflectivity. A CD-RW does not have as great a difference in reflectivity as a pressed CD or a CD-R, and so many earlier CD audio players ''cannot'' read CD-RW discs, although ''most'' later CD audio players and stand-alone [[DVD]] players can. CD-RWs follow the ''Orange Book'' standard.\n\nThe ReWritable Audio CD is designed to be used in a consumer audio CD recorder, which will not (without modification) accept standard CD-RW discs. These consumer audio CD recorders use the [[Serial Copy Management System]] (SCMS), an early form of [[digital rights management]] (DRM), to conform to the United States' [[Audio Home Recording Act]] (AHRA). The ReWritable Audio CD is typically somewhat more expensive than CD-RW due to (a) lower volume and (b) a 3 percent [[Audio Home Recording Act#AHRA royalties|AHRA royalty]] used to compensate the music industry for the making of a copy.<ref name=\"McFadden\"/>\n\n== Copy protection ==\n{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}\nThe ''Red Book'' audio specification, except for a simple \"anti-copy\" statement in the subcode, does not include any [[copy protection]] mechanism. Known at least as early as 2001,<ref name=\"BadCDs\"/> attempts were made by record companies to market \"copy-protected\" non-standard compact discs, which cannot be [[Ripping|ripped]], or copied, to hard drives or easily converted to other formats (like [[FLAC]], [[MP3]] or [[Vorbis]]). One major drawback to these copy-protected discs is that most will not play on either computer CD-ROM drives or some standalone CD players that use CD-ROM mechanisms. Philips has stated that such discs are not permitted to bear the trademarked ''Compact Disc Digital Audio'' logo because they violate the ''Red Book'' specifications. Numerous copy-protection systems have been countered by readily available, often free, software, or even by simply turning off automatic [[AutoPlay]] to prevent the running of the DRM [[executable]] program.\n==Other uses==\n[[File:Compact disc bird scarers.JPG|thumb|Old CDs hanging from a tree to scare birds from the crops.]]\nAfter the fall in popularity of CDs, old discs or failed CD-R have been repurposed, since the reflections of the sun on a moving plate may [[bird scarer|scare birds]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n\n* [[5.1 Music Disc]]\n* [[Compact disc bronzing]]\n* [[Digipak]]\n* [[DualDisc]]\n* [[Extended Resolution Compact Disc]]\n* [[GD-ROM]]\n* [[Hidden Track]]\n* [[High Definition Compatible Digital]]\n* [[Longbox]]\n* [[SPARS code]]\n* [[Video Single Disc]]\n* [[List of optical disc manufacturers]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite news |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |title=Technical Grammy Award |access-date=5 November 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026094809/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/producers-and-engineers/awards |archivedate=26 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-1\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |title=Compact Disc Hits 25th birthday |work=BBC News |date=17 August 2007 |access-date=1 December 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218031404/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950845.stm |archivedate=18 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"AutoMR-2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | work=The New York Times | title=As CD Sales Wane, Music Retailers Diversify | first=Joseph | last=Plambeck | date=30 May 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501175846/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/31/business/media/31bestbuy.html | archivedate=1 May 2017 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"peek\">{{cite journal |first=Hans B. |last=Peek |title=The Emergence of the Compact Disc |journal=IEEE Communications Magazine |date=January 2010 |pages=10\u201317 |volume=48 |number=1 |issn=0163-6804 |doi=10.1109/MCOM.2010.5394021 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SonyHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | title = A Long Play Digital Audio Disc System | publisher = AES | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090725223113/http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2912 | archivedate = 25 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"BBC6950933\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | title = How the CD Was Developed | work = BBC News | date = 17 August 2007 | access-date = 17 August 2007 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071222035025/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6950933.stm | archivedate = 22 December 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"PhilipsHistorical\">{{cite web | url = http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | title = Philips Compact Disc | publisher = Philips | access-date = 14 February 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090319141821/http://www.philipsmuseumeindhoven.nl/phe/products/e_cd.htm | archivedate = 19 March 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"IEEE_CD_Milestone\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | title = IEEE CD Milestone | publisher = IEEE Global History Network | access-date = 14 October 2010 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091126195434/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Compact_Disc_Audio_Player,_1979 | archivedate = 26 November 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ohgaobituary\">{{ citation | url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | title = Sony chairman credited with developing CDs dies | access-date = 14 October 2012 | work = Fox News | date = 24 April 2011 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130521044524/http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/04/24/sony-chairman-credited-developing-cds-dies/ | archivedate = 21 May 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Immink2\">{{Cite journal \n|journal=IEEE Information Theory Society Newsletter\n|volume=57 \n|date=2007\n|title=Shannon, Beethoven, and the Compact Disc\n|author=K.

His seminal work was ''The Geography of the Oceans''.\n\n==Family==\nJohn Francon Williams was the second son of Richard Williams (b. 1818 [[Llanllechid]]) and his wife Mary (b. 1822 [[Denbighshire]]). Richard and Mary were blessed with two further sons, William (b. 1843) and Henry (b. 1858), and two daughters, Mary Jr. (b. 1857)<ref>1861 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 43), Mary Williams (aged 39) and their children, William (aged 18), John (aged 7), Mary (aged 4), Henry (aged 3), residing at Cenfaes Terrace,[[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> and Grace (b. 1862).<ref>1871 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 54), Mary Williams (aged 49) and their children, John (aged 17), Mary (aged 14), Henry (aged 13), and Grace (aged 9) residing at Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), [[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> All the children were born in [[Llanllechid]], North Wales. The Williams family first lived at Cenfaes Terrace and then, as the family grew larger, moved to a stone cottage at 5 Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), one of a row of traditional terraced stone cottages in [[Llanllechid]], where all their immediate neighbours were also named Williams. The cottages positioned on a gentle slope had views directly overlooking the [[Ogwen Valley]] and the Snowdonian Mountains in the distance. Richard worked nearby as a slate quarryman (most probably) in [[Penrhyn Quarry]] located north of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] overlooking the [[River Ogwen]]. The Quarry was owned and run by the wealthy Dawkins-Pennant family who also owned [[Penrhyn Castle]] and most of the land in the area. Over time, Richard Williams was promoted to the role of 'Overlooker' (a term used in the 19th century for a superintendent or overseer)<ref>Obscure Old English Occupations:http://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php (retrieved 12 February 2018)</ref> at the slate quarry where he worked.\n\nDuring the next decade an increase of population in the area occurred due to the extension of slate and stone quarrying. In the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (published in 1870-2), [[Llanllechid]] is described as thus: \"Llanllechid, a village, a parish, and a sub-district in Bangor district, Carnarvon. The village stands near the river Ogwen, 3\u00bd miles SW by S of Aber r. station, and 3\u00bd SE of Bangor; and has a post office under Bangor, and a fair on 29 October.\"<ref>[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] edited by Rev.

By the mid-1870s, as a young adult, John moved away from Wales to [[Northampton]] where he took up a post as a school teacher. It was in [[Northampton]] that John met his future wife Barbara.\n\nOn 8 July 1876, John married Barbara Balmain Dougall at St. Giles Church, [[Northampton]].<ref>1876 Marriage Certificate: Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church in the Parish of St Giles, Northampton \u2013 8 July 1876 \u2013 No. 29, between John Williams, School Master of Palmerston Road; father's name: Richard Williams (Overlooker at Slate Quarries), and Barbara Balmain Dougall; father's name John Dougall (manufacturer)</ref> The newlyweds first home was at Palmerston Road, Northampton.

In London influenza became epidemic for the second time about the end of April, and soon afterwards was widely distributed in England and Wales. The large towns in the north, together with London and Wales, suffered much more heavily in mortality than in the previous attack. In 1891 it was very sudden and extremely severe, the death-rate rising to 73.4 during the month of April, and subsiding with equal rapidity.

The book was written in collaboration with cartographer Professor [[William Hughes (geographer)]] [[FRGS]] and became the first publication in a successful run of works over the coming two decades by Williams for the publishing house George Philip & Son.

Each book (of which there were at least 22 in the series) contained: (I) A complete full-colored map, so attached as to be always available for copying; (II) An uncolored map without the names, which the pupil can fill in as an introductory exercise; (III) An outline map, with coastline and lines of latitude and longitude only \u2013 the pupil being required to fill in the mountains, rivers, towns etc. with the names: (VI) A map with lines of latitude and longitude only; (V) A blank sheet with the border of the map only. The books were issued in two sizes costing threepence and sixpence each. A review in ''the Practical Teacher'' (May 1882) of two books from the series, No. 2 England and Wales, and No. 22 Australia, maintained; \u2018Williams has done a good service in publishing this series of Map-Drawing books.

A glowing review of ''Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' appeared in the ''West London Observer'' on Saturday 23 July 1887: \"In days when the facilities of locomotion are such that everybody runs about the world, and the process of what popularly known as 'globe-trotting' goes on to an extraordinary extent and in a systematic manner, a comprehensive volume, small, compact, admirably arranged, clearly printed and well bound, and which can be carried in the pocket, like that published by Messrs. Philip & Son of Liverpool and London, is entitled to be regarded as a special boon. Containing more than a hundred maps with brief but succinct notes and a capital index, the different countries of the world are revealed in all essential particulars with luminous perspicacity. The maps are fine specimens of engraving, and the letterpress clear and distinct. The author is Mr. J. Francon Williams FRGS and his name will be a sufficient guarantee for the correctness of the data furnished up to the period of publication. The production of this most useful work must have entailed a large outlay, but it cannot be doubted that, as it will supply a popular want, the sale will be enormous, and fully compensate the enterprising publishers for the cost and trouble incurred. We earnestly recommend the 'Handy Volume', not alone to travellers, but to all who have occasion in connection with literary pursuits, or the prosecution of business, 'to survey mankind from China to Peru,' or over those wider districts, which a century ago were practically beyond even a poets pen.\"<ref>''West London Observer'', Saturday 23 July 1887, p. 5 \u2013 Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' (review).</ref>\n\nIn the late 1880s, Williams worked in conjunction with the publisher and editor [[George Newnes]] (Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet) \u2013 now regarded as the founding father of popular journalism \u2013 during the years when Newnes was building his publishing empire.

A few months later, once ''Stories Illustrated'' was up and running, Williams increased its price to 3.1/2d. Being of similar format to ''Strand Magazine'', such competition irked Newnes and appears to have encouraged him to reach out and make Williams an offer to sell ''Stories Illustrated'' to him. Newnes had originally been inspired to create ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in 1891 as a competitor to the successful American monthly ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', which had now made inroads into the British market. In publishing ''Strand Magazin''e Newnes undercut ''Harper\u2019s'' price by 50 per-cent.<ref>''Revolutions from Grub Street: A History of Magazine Publishing in Britain'' by Howard Cox, Simon Mowatt, (publisher: OUP Oxford, 6 Mar. 2014) {{ISBN|978-0199601639}}, page 25</ref> Each publisher undercut the other in order to get higher sales. For whatever reason Williams accepted Newnes's offer to purchase ''Stories Illustrated'', the deal later transpired not to be what Williams had been assured. Newnes had bought ''Stories Illustrated'' to expand his growing catalogue after the recent floatation of his company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] had netted him \u00a31 million,<ref>''Sherlock Holmes My Life'' by Lawrence R. Spencer, (publisher: lulu.com, 20 Jan. 2011) {{ISBN|978-0557863518}} page 80-81 \u2013 the author discusses the \u00a31 million restructuring of George Newnes Ltd.</ref> the equivalent of which in 2019 would be over \u00a3128 million. The discrepancy of the \u00a330,000 undervaluation of the magazine came to light after the deal had been signed. As a result, a huge rift developed between Williams and Newnes. the matter was never resolved and led to a breakdown in friendship between the two men that lasted for the remainder of their lives.\n\n===Later career===\nBy late 1898, the Williams family had moved yet again and were now living in a detached house ''Fairlight'' in Forest Avenue, Chingford, London.<ref>Letter to [[John George Bartholomew]] from John Francon Williams, dated 17 November 1898, and addressed, Fairlight, Forest Avenue, Chingford, London \u2013 National Library Scotland \u2013 Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH91PH: J.

He would travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], [[London]] and also abroad, primarily the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], pursuing and securing contracts for publishing houses. One of the houses he acted for in [[Edinburgh]] was [[John Bartholomew and Son]], which now belonged to his longtime friend, [[John George Bartholomew]].

Williams was particularly keen to publish a Physical Atlas worldwide through the syndicate.\n\nIn 1899, Williams was commissioned by Mazawattee (publishers) to write a Gazetteer Pocket Atlas containing 9,000 to 10,000 places.<ref>In a handwritten letter from Williams to [[John George Bartholomew]] dated 3 January 1899 held in the [[National Library of Scotland]] Williams mentions his commission for the atlas by the Mazawattee company.</ref> Williams was also commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], (later 1st Viscount Northcliffe), founder of the ''Harmsworth Magazine'' (later known as the ''London Magazine''), to write a series of articles. His first article, published at the beginning of 1900, was entitled ''Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time''. It was written to commemorate the advancement in engineering during the 19th century and to welcome the 20th century.<ref>Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time, article by J.F.

From the manner John writes to his friend one assumes Bartholomew has agreed to produce the maps for the publication. Williams talks of submitting the project to [[George Philip & Son]] publishing house in the hope they might publish it. He also mentions an alternative publisher [[C. Arthur Pearson|C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.]] to submit it to as a \u2018second\u2019 placing as he personally knows [[C. Arthur Pearson]] and his managing partner Peter Keary. His concerns regarding copyright of the \u2018self-educator Atlas\u2019 have prompted Williams to confide in his friend that he intends to have his idea patented; \u2018I wouldn\u2019t dream of ever suggesting anything of the kind, but these huge administrative houses have the idea-absorption propensity so strongly developed that every possible means of legitimate protection is fully justified.\u2019 <ref>Handwritten letter from J.F.

John Francon Williams and his eldest son John Williams Jr. happened to be in Manchester attending to publishing business on 24 December and had arranged to spend Christmas Day with relatives and friends in [[Clackmannan]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. They decided to catch the overnight express train at Manchester, so that they could enjoy Christmas festivities in Clackmannan.\n\nAt 19 minutes to six in the morning, close to [[Hawes Junction]], the express train travelling at high speed smashed into an oncoming locomotive. The express train concertina'd and careered off the tracks. Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The impact broke the gas pipe in one of the front carriages and an explosion followed. Fire spread quickly through the wooden carriages killing twelve trapped and injured passengers.\n\nThe ''Dundee Courier'' on Tuesday 27 December in their coverage of the [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] reported: ''The news of the disaster occasioned considerable anxiety to the relatives of Mr John Francon Williams, a prominent and highly-respected resident of Clackmannan. Mr Williams and his eldest son Mr John Williams, were in business in Manchester, and had sent word to their friends in Clackmannan that they intended to travel North with the night express so as to arrive home on Saturday morning for Christmas. The fact that they did not put in an appearance in Clackmannan on Saturday, coupled with the news of the disaster, naturally aroused fears for their safety in the minds of their waiting relatives. Telegraphic communication was opened up with the hotel in Manchester where Mr Williams had been staying, and yesterday (26 December) it was ascertained that, though the father and son had fully intended travelling with the ill-fated express, through pressure of business they had been compelled to postpone their departure till Monday evening, an arrangement, which, in the light of what subsequently occurred, may be regarded as providential.'' <ref>''The Dundee Courier'', Tuesday 27 December 1910, p. 5 \u2013 Pathetic Scenes at Hawes Junction During Inquest on Victims of Express Disaster (report) \u2013 Clackmannan Gentleman's Providential Escape (retrieved 8 August 2017).</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1911 John's landscape had changed dramatically.

His seminal work was ''The Geography of the Oceans''.\n\n==Family==\nJohn Francon Williams was the second son of Richard Williams (b. 1818 [[Llanllechid]]) and his wife Mary (b. 1822 [[Denbighshire]]). Richard and Mary were blessed with two further sons, William (b. 1843) and Henry (b. 1858), and two daughters, Mary Jr. (b. 1857)<ref>1861 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 43), Mary Williams (aged 39) and their children, William (aged 18), John (aged 7), Mary (aged 4), Henry (aged 3), residing at Cenfaes Terrace,[[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> and Grace (b. 1862).<ref>1871 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 54), Mary Williams (aged 49) and their children, John (aged 17), Mary (aged 14), Henry (aged 13), and Grace (aged 9) residing at Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), [[Llanllechid]], (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)</ref> All the children were born in [[Llanllechid]], North Wales. The Williams family first lived at Cenfaes Terrace and then, as the family grew larger, moved to a stone cottage at 5 Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), one of a row of traditional terraced stone cottages in [[Llanllechid]], where all their immediate neighbours were also named Williams. The cottages positioned on a gentle slope had views directly overlooking the [[Ogwen Valley]] and the Snowdonian Mountains in the distance. Richard worked nearby as a slate quarryman (most probably) in [[Penrhyn Quarry]] located north of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] overlooking the [[River Ogwen]]. The Quarry was owned and run by the wealthy Dawkins-Pennant family who also owned [[Penrhyn Castle]] and most of the land in the area. Over time, Richard Williams was promoted to the role of 'Overlooker' (a term used in the 19th century for a superintendent or overseer)<ref>Obscure Old English Occupations:http://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php (retrieved 12 February 2018)</ref> at the slate quarry where he worked.\n\nDuring the next decade an increase of population in the area occurred due to the extension of slate and stone quarrying. In the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (published in 1870-2), [[Llanllechid]] is described as thus: \"Llanllechid, a village, a parish, and a sub-district in Bangor district, Carnarvon. The village stands near the river Ogwen, 3\u00bd miles SW by S of Aber r. station, and 3\u00bd SE of Bangor; and has a post office under Bangor, and a fair on 29 October.\"<ref>[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] edited by Rev.

By the mid-1870s, as a young adult, John moved away from Wales to [[Northampton]] where he took up a post as a school teacher. It was in [[Northampton]] that John met his future wife Barbara.\n\nOn 8 July 1876, John married Barbara Balmain Dougall at St. Giles Church, [[Northampton]].<ref>1876 Marriage Certificate: Marriage solemnized at the Parish Church in the Parish of St Giles, Northampton \u2013 8 July 1876 \u2013 No. 29, between John Williams, School Master of Palmerston Road; father's name: Richard Williams (Overlooker at Slate Quarries), and Barbara Balmain Dougall; father's name John Dougall (manufacturer)</ref> The newlyweds first home was at Palmerston Road, Northampton.

In 1885, Grace married Welsh-born Robert William Williams (1861\u20131931) in [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]], North Wales, hence Grace and her future offspring retained the Williams surname. \n \nIn 1891, John's father, mother and a brother died (most probably due to the influenza epidemic that spread across Wales and Northern England),<ref>FluTrackers: Flu Pandemic 1891 (retrieved 17 February 2018: 'The earliest signs of an epidemic revival on a large scale occurred in March 1891, in the United States and the north of England. In England it began in the Yorkshire towns, particularly in Hull, and also independently in South Wales. In London influenza became epidemic for the second time about the end of April, and soon afterwards was widely distributed in England and Wales. The large towns in the north, together with London and Wales, suffered much more heavily in mortality than in the previous attack. In 1891 it was very sudden and extremely severe, the death-rate rising to 73.4 during the month of April, and subsiding with equal rapidity.

[[George Philip & Son]] published maps and educational books and in 1881 they published Williams's first book, ''A Class-Book of Modern Geography'', with examination questions, notes & index. The book was written in collaboration with cartographer Professor [[William Hughes (geographer)]] [[FRGS]] and became the first publication in a successful run of works over the coming two decades by Williams for the publishing house George Philip & Son.

The publishing house produced geographical and educational publications and operated from Caxton Buildings in [[Liverpool]], and from 30\u201332 [[Fleet Street]] in London.\n\n\"Further expansion was prompted by the demand from board schools established after 1870 for general textbooks, school stationery and equipment, and specialist atlases and wall maps.

A review in ''the Practical Teacher'' (May 1882) of two books from the series, No. 2 England and Wales, and No. 22 Australia, maintained; \u2018Williams has done a good service in publishing this series of Map-Drawing books.

A glowing review of ''Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' appeared in the ''West London Observer'' on Saturday 23 July 1887: \"In days when the facilities of locomotion are such that everybody runs about the world, and the process of what popularly known as 'globe-trotting' goes on to an extraordinary extent and in a systematic manner, a comprehensive volume, small, compact, admirably arranged, clearly printed and well bound, and which can be carried in the pocket, like that published by Messrs. Philip & Son of Liverpool and London, is entitled to be regarded as a special boon. Containing more than a hundred maps with brief but succinct notes and a capital index, the different countries of the world are revealed in all essential particulars with luminous perspicacity. The maps are fine specimens of engraving, and the letterpress clear and distinct. The author is Mr. J. Francon Williams FRGS and his name will be a sufficient guarantee for the correctness of the data furnished up to the period of publication. The production of this most useful work must have entailed a large outlay, but it cannot be doubted that, as it will supply a popular want, the sale will be enormous, and fully compensate the enterprising publishers for the cost and trouble incurred. We earnestly recommend the 'Handy Volume', not alone to travellers, but to all who have occasion in connection with literary pursuits, or the prosecution of business, 'to survey mankind from China to Peru,' or over those wider districts, which a century ago were practically beyond even a poets pen.\"<ref>''West London Observer'', Saturday 23 July 1887, p. 5 \u2013 Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' (review).</ref>\n\nIn the late 1880s, Williams worked in conjunction with the publisher and editor [[George Newnes]] (Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet) \u2013 now regarded as the founding father of popular journalism \u2013 during the years when Newnes was building his publishing empire.

A few months later, once ''Stories Illustrated'' was up and running, Williams increased its price to 3.1/2d. Being of similar format to ''Strand Magazine'', such competition irked Newnes and appears to have encouraged him to reach out and make Williams an offer to sell ''Stories Illustrated'' to him. Newnes had originally been inspired to create ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in 1891 as a competitor to the successful American monthly ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', which had now made inroads into the British market. In publishing ''Strand Magazin''e Newnes undercut ''Harper\u2019s'' price by 50 per-cent.<ref>''Revolutions from Grub Street: A History of Magazine Publishing in Britain'' by Howard Cox, Simon Mowatt, (publisher: OUP Oxford, 6 Mar. 2014) {{ISBN|978-0199601639}}, page 25</ref> Each publisher undercut the other in order to get higher sales. For whatever reason Williams accepted Newnes's offer to purchase ''Stories Illustrated'', the deal later transpired not to be what Williams had been assured. Newnes had bought ''Stories Illustrated'' to expand his growing catalogue after the recent floatation of his company on the [[London Stock Exchange]] had netted him \u00a31 million,<ref>''Sherlock Holmes My Life'' by Lawrence R. Spencer, (publisher: lulu.com, 20 Jan. 2011) {{ISBN|978-0557863518}} page 80-81 \u2013 the author discusses the \u00a31 million restructuring of George Newnes Ltd.</ref> the equivalent of which in 2019 would be over \u00a3128 million. The discrepancy of the \u00a330,000 undervaluation of ''Stories Illustrated'' appears to have come to light after Williams had signed the contract to sell the publication to Newnes. As a result, a huge rift developed between Williams and Newnes that lasted for the remainder of Williams's life.\n\n===Later career===\nBy late 1898, the Williams family had moved yet again and were now living in a detached house ''Fairlight'' in Forest Avenue, Chingford, London.<ref>Letter to [[John George Bartholomew]] from John Francon Williams, dated 17 November 1898, and addressed, Fairlight, Forest Avenue, Chingford, London \u2013 National Library Scotland \u2013 Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH91PH: J.

John Jr. was noted as being a sickly child, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 23 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]], in which Williams talks of his eldest son John, \"who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis.\"</ref> In 1899, Williams's friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (a Liverpool ship-owner) of Messrs [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder, Dempster & Co.]], kindly gave Williams's son John Jr. a voyage on one of his steamers to [[New Orleans]] in the hope that it would help with his medical condition.\n\nOne of the prime reasons why Williams travelled to the United States was to try and set up an Anglo-American Syndicate, which would help promote publishers, publishing houses and their products. Williams discusses this matter in a handwritten letter to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]].<ref>Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 28 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]] in which Williams talks of setting up an Anglo-American Syndicate.</ref> In it he mentions his \"unavoidable connection\" with map-maker [[George Washington Bacon]], with whom he is working with on several projects, both editorial and administrative, and hopes that his friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (the millionaire ship-owner) might be interested in becoming a financial partner in the Syndicate. Williams was particularly keen to publish a Physical Atlas worldwide through the syndicate.\n\nIn 1899, Williams was commissioned by Mazawattee (publishers) to write a Gazetteer Pocket Atlas containing 9,000 to 10,000 places.<ref>In a handwritten letter from Williams to [[John George Bartholomew]] dated 3 January 1899 held in the [[National Library of Scotland]] Williams mentions his commission for the atlas by the Mazawattee company.</ref> Williams was also commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], (later 1st Viscount Northcliffe), founder of the ''Harmsworth Magazine'' (later known as the ''London Magazine''), to write a series of articles. His first article, published at the beginning of 1900, was entitled ''Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time''. It was written to commemorate the advancement in engineering during the 19th century and to welcome the 20th century.<ref>Then and Now: 1800\u20131900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time, article by J.F.

From the manner John writes to his friend one assumes Bartholomew has agreed to produce the maps for the publication. Williams talks of submitting the project to [[George Philip & Son]] publishing house in the hope they might publish it. He also mentions an alternative publisher [[C. Arthur Pearson|C. Arthur Pearson Ltd.]] to submit it to as a \u2018second\u2019 placing as he personally knows [[C. Arthur Pearson]] and his managing partner Peter Keary. His concerns regarding copyright of the \u2018self-educator Atlas\u2019 have prompted Williams to confide in his friend that he intends to have his idea patented; \u2018I wouldn\u2019t dream of ever suggesting anything of the kind, but these huge administrative houses have the idea-absorption propensity so strongly developed that every possible means of legitimate protection is fully justified.\u2019 <ref>Handwritten letter from J.F.

John Francon Williams and his eldest son John Williams Jr. happened to be in Manchester attending to publishing business on 24 December and had arranged to spend Christmas Day with relatives and friends in [[Clackmannan]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. They decided to catch the overnight express train at Manchester, so that they could enjoy Christmas festivities in Clackmannan.\n\nAt 19 minutes to six in the morning, close to [[Hawes Junction]], the express train travelling at high speed smashed into an oncoming locomotive. The express train concertina'd and careered off the tracks. Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The impact broke the gas pipe in one of the front carriages and an explosion followed. Fire spread quickly through the wooden carriages killing twelve trapped and injured passengers.\n\nThe ''Dundee Courier'' on Tuesday 27 December in their coverage of the [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] reported: ''The news of the disaster occasioned considerable anxiety to the relatives of Mr John Francon Williams, a prominent and highly-respected resident of Clackmannan. Mr Williams and his eldest son Mr John Williams, were in business in Manchester, and had sent word to their friends in Clackmannan that they intended to travel North with the night express so as to arrive home on Saturday morning for Christmas. The fact that they did not put in an appearance in Clackmannan on Saturday, coupled with the news of the disaster, naturally aroused fears for their safety in the minds of their waiting relatives. Telegraphic communication was opened up with the hotel in Manchester where Mr Williams had been staying, and yesterday (26 December) it was ascertained that, though the father and son had fully intended travelling with the ill-fated express, through pressure of business they had been compelled to postpone their departure till Monday evening, an arrangement, which, in the light of what subsequently occurred, may be regarded as providential.'' <ref>''The Dundee Courier'', Tuesday 27 December 1910, p. 5 \u2013 Pathetic Scenes at Hawes Junction During Inquest on Victims of Express Disaster (report) \u2013 Clackmannan Gentleman's Providential Escape (retrieved 8 August 2017).</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nBy 1911 John's landscape had changed dramatically.
