His economical and understated style\u2014which he termed the [[iceberg theory]]\u2014had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of [[American literature]].\n\nHemingway was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' before leaving for the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1929).\n\nIn 1921, Hemingway married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of four wives. They moved to Paris where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s' \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His debut novel ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927 and married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]; they divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he had been a journalist. He based ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940) on his experience there. [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]] in London during [[World War II]]. He was present with the troops as a journalist at the [[Normandy landings]] and the [[liberation of Paris]].\n\nHemingway maintained permanent residences in [[Key West, Florida]] (in the 1930s) and [[Cuba]] (in the 1940s and 1950s). He almost died in 1954 after two plane crashes in as many days; these back-to-back accidents left him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life.

After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\u2014or at least very little\u2014is stated explicitly.\"<ref name=\"Putnam\" />  \n\nBecause he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name=\"Baker p117\">Baker (1972),  117</ref> Hemingway called his style the [[iceberg theory]]: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight.<ref name=\"Baker p117\" /> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \"theory of omission\". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \"The Big Two-Hearted River\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>Oliver (1999), 321\u2013322</ref>  Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'', showed he was still experimenting with his writing style.<ref>Smith (1996), 45</ref> He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are [[simple sentence]]s\u2014a childlike syntax without [[subordinate clause|subordination]].<ref>Wells (1975), 130\u2013133</ref>\n\nJackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\"<ref>Benson (1989), 351</ref>  Writing in \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway explains: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"<ref>Hemingway (1975), 3</ref>\n\nThe simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had \"used up words\". Hemingway offers a \"multi-focal\" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic \"[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]\" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \"embedded text\" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of \"cutting\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \"splicing\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>Trodd (2007), 8</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote = In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.

This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence\u2014or in later works his use of subordinate clauses\u2014uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images.  Benson compares them to [[haiku]]s.<ref name=\"McCormick p49\">McCormick, 49</ref><ref>Benson 1989, 309</ref> Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; [[Saul Bellow]] satirized this style as \"Do you have emotions? Strangle them.\"<ref>qtd. in Hoberek (2005), 309</ref> However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always\".<ref>Hemingway, Ernest.

Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\"\u2014the [[American Old West|American West]]\u2014extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" />  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\" /> Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\">Baker (1972), 101\u2013121</ref> At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], evident in detailed descriptions such as those in \"Big Two-Hearted River\".<ref name=\"Beegel2000, p. 63-70\" />\n\nFiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil \"Dark Woman\" versus the good \"Light Woman\". The dark woman\u2014Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''\u2014is a goddess; the light woman\u2014Margot Macomber of \"[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]\"\u2014is a murderess.<ref name=\"Fiedler\">Fiedler (1975), 345\u2013365</ref> [[Robert Scholes]] admits that early Hemingway stories, such as \"[[A Very Short Story]]\", present \"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably\".<ref>Scholes (1990),  42</ref>  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \"castrators or love-slaves\". Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as \"public enemy number one\", although more recent re-evaluations of his work \"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.\"<ref>Sanderson (1996), 171</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber \"are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.{{'\"}}<ref>Baym (1990), 112</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote =The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.

The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in \"Indian Camp\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man\". Hemingway sets the events in \"Indian Camp\" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes \"Indian Camp\" holds the \"master key\" to \"what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career\".<ref>Young (1964), 6</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if \"nothingness\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\">Stoltzfus (2005), 215\u2013218</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo M\u00fcller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an \"authentic life\", and the \"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\".<ref>M\u00fcller (2010), 31</ref>\n\nThe theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \"natural\" versus the \"unnatural\". In \"Alpine Idyll\" the \"unnaturalness\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \"unnaturalness\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \"natural\" spring for redemption.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\" />\n\nSusan Beegel has written that some more recent critics\u2014writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first published\u2014have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as [[misogynistic]] and [[homophobic]].<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\">Beegel (1996), 282</ref> In her 1996 essay, \"Critical Reception\", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that \"critics interested in multiculturalism\", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some \"apologetics\" have been written.<ref>Beegel (1996)</ref> Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', in which a critic contended: \"Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.\" Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the \"horror of [[homosexuality]]\" and the \"[[racism]]\" typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction.<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\" /> In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: \"Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article294978/Susan-Beegel-What-I-like-about-Hemingway.html|title=Susan Beegel: What I like about Hemingway|website=kansascity.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and legacy ==\n[[File:Statue of Hemingway at Floridita.jpg|thumb|Life-sized statue of Hemingway by [[Jos\u00e9 Villa Sober\u00f3n]], at [[El Floridita]] bar in [[Havana]]]]\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140\u2013141</ref> After his reputation was established with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post-World War&nbsp;I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name=\"Nagel 1996 87\" /> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\".<ref name=\"Hallengren\">Hallengren, Anders.

His economical and understated style\u2014which he termed the [[iceberg theory]]\u2014had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of [[American literature]].\n\nHemingway was raised in [[Oak Park, Illinois]]. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'' before leaving for the [[Italian Front (World War I)|Italian Front]] to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1929).\n\nIn 1921, Hemingway married [[Hadley Richardson]], the first of four wives. They moved to Paris where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the [[modernism|modernist]] writers and artists of the 1920s' \"[[Lost Generation]]\" expatriate community. His debut novel ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]'' was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927 and married [[Pauline Pfeiffer]]; they divorced after he returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he had been a journalist. He based ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1940) on his experience there. [[Martha Gellhorn]] became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met [[Mary Welsh Hemingway|Mary Welsh]] in London during [[World War II]]. He was present with the troops as a journalist at the [[Normandy landings]] and the [[liberation of Paris]].\n\nHemingway maintained permanent residences in [[Key West, Florida]] (in the 1930s) and [[Cuba]] (in the 1940s and 1950s). He almost died in 1954 after two plane crashes in as many days; these back-to-back accidents left him in pain and ill health for much of the rest of his life. In 1959, he bought a house in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], where, in mid-1961, he ended his own life.\n\n== Life ==\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:ErnestHemingwayBabyPicture.jpg|thumb|upright|Hemingway was the second child and first son born to Clarence and Grace]]\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a suburb of Chicago,<ref>Oliver (1999), 140</ref> to Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, a physician, and [[Grace Hall Hemingway]], a musician. His parents were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park,<ref name=\"Reynolds pp 17-18\" /> a conservative community about which resident  [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] said, \"So many churches for so many good people to go to.\"<ref>Meyers (1985), 4</ref>  For a short period after their marriage,<ref>Oliver (1999), 134</ref> Clarence and Grace Hemingway lived with Grace's father, Ernest Hall, Hemingway's namesake.

Reynolds points out that he shared similar energies and enthusiasms.<ref name=\"Reynolds 2000 19\"/>\nEach summer the family traveled to [[Ernest Hemingway Cottage|Windemere]] on [[Walloon Lake]], near [[Petoskey, Michigan]]. There young Ernest joined his father and learned to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of [[Northern Michigan]], early experiences that instilled a life-long passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.<ref name=\"Beegel2000, p. 63-70\">Beegel (2000), 63\u201371</ref>\n\nHemingway attended [[Oak Park and River Forest High School]] from 1913 until 1917. He was a good athlete, involved with a number of sports\u2014boxing, track and field, water polo, and football; performed in the school orchestra for two years with his sister Marcelline; and received good grades in English classes.<ref name=\"Reynolds 2000 19\" />  During his last two years at high school he edited the ''Trapeze'' and ''Tabula'' (the school's newspaper and yearbook), where he imitated the language of sportswriters and used the [[pen name]] Ring Lardner, Jr.\u2014a nod to [[Ring Lardner]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' whose byline was \"Line O'Type\".<ref name=\"Meyers p19ff\" /> Like [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], and [[Sinclair Lewis]], Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist.

On his first day in [[Milan]], he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion to join rescuers retrieving the shredded remains of female workers.

By the time of his release and return to the United States in January 1919, Agnes and Hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in America. However, in March, she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers states in his book ''Hemingway: A Biography'' that Hemingway was devastated by Agnes's rejection, and in future relationships, he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him.<ref name=\"Meyers p37ff\">Meyers (1985), 37\u201342</ref>\n\n=== Toronto and Chicago ===\nHemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment.

Late that year he began as a freelancer and staff writer for the ''Toronto Star Weekly''.

After World War&nbsp;I, he and other modernists \"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\u2014or at least very little\u2014is stated explicitly.\"<ref name=\"Putnam\" />  \n\nBecause he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to \"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name=\"Baker p117\">Baker (1972),  117</ref> Hemingway called his style the [[iceberg theory]]: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight.<ref name=\"Baker p117\" /> The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \"theory of omission\". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \"The Big Two-Hearted River\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).<ref>Oliver (1999), 321\u2013322</ref>  Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]'', showed he was still experimenting with his writing style.<ref>Smith (1996), 45</ref> He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are [[simple sentence]]s\u2014a childlike syntax without [[subordinate clause|subordination]].<ref>Wells (1975), 130\u2013133</ref>\n\nJackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\"<ref>Benson (1989), 351</ref>  Writing in \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway explains: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"<ref>Hemingway (1975), 3</ref>\n\nThe simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to [[Henry James]]'s observation that World War&nbsp;I had \"used up words\". Hemingway offers a \"multi-focal\" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks [[grammatical conjunction|subordinating conjunctions]], creates static sentences. The photographic \"[[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]]\" style creates a [[collage]] of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \"embedded text\" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of \"cutting\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \"splicing\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.<ref>Trodd (2007), 8</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote = In the late summer that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains.

This use of [[polysyndeton]] may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence\u2014or in later works his use of subordinate clauses\u2014uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images.  Benson compares them to [[haiku]]s.<ref name=\"McCormick p49\">McCormick, 49</ref><ref>Benson 1989, 309</ref> Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; [[Saul Bellow]] satirized this style as \"Do you have emotions? Strangle them.\"<ref>qtd. in Hoberek (2005), 309</ref> However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always\".<ref>Hemingway, Ernest.

Critic [[Leslie Fiedler]] sees the theme he defines as \"The Sacred Land\"\u2014the [[American Old West|American West]]\u2014extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \"Hotel Montana\" in ''The Sun Also Rises'' and ''For Whom the Bell Tolls''.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" />  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\" /> Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\">Baker (1972), 101\u2013121</ref> At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], evident in detailed descriptions such as those in \"Big Two-Hearted River\".<ref name=\"Beegel2000, p. 63-70\" />\n\nFiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil \"Dark Woman\" versus the good \"Light Woman\". The dark woman\u2014Brett Ashley of ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''\u2014is a goddess; the light woman\u2014Margot Macomber of \"[[The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber]]\"\u2014is a murderess.<ref name=\"Fiedler\">Fiedler (1975), 345\u2013365</ref> [[Robert Scholes]] admits that early Hemingway stories, such as \"[[A Very Short Story]]\", present \"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably\".<ref>Scholes (1990),  42</ref>  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \"castrators or love-slaves\". Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as \"public enemy number one\", although more recent re-evaluations of his work \"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.\"<ref>Sanderson (1996), 171</ref> Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber \"are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.{{'\"}}<ref>Baym (1990), 112</ref>\n\n{{quote box | width = 22em\n|quote =The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.

(1929) ''A Farewell to Arms]''. New York: Scribner's</ref>\n| style = padding:1.5em\n| fontsize=85%\n}}\n\nThe theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as \"[[Indian Camp]]\". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in \"Indian Camp\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \"badly scarred and nervous young man\". Hemingway sets the events in \"Indian Camp\" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes \"Indian Camp\" holds the \"master key\" to \"what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career\".<ref>Young (1964), 6</ref> Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in [[existentialism]]: if \"nothingness\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the [[bullfighter]] in the [[Bullfighting|corrida]] represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus\">Stoltzfus (2005), 215\u2013218</ref> In his paper ''The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field'', Timo M\u00fcller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an \"authentic life\", and the \"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\".<ref>M\u00fcller (2010), 31</ref>\n\nThe theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in ''The Sun Also Rises''. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained [[Women's suffrage|emancipation]]. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times.<ref name=\"Fiedler\" /> Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \"natural\" versus the \"unnatural\". In \"Alpine Idyll\" the \"unnaturalness\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \"unnaturalness\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \"natural\" spring for redemption.<ref name=\"Baker1972 101\u2013121\" />\n\nSusan Beegel has written that some more recent critics\u2014writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first published\u2014have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as [[misogynistic]] and [[homophobic]].<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\">Beegel (1996), 282</ref> In her 1996 essay, \"Critical Reception\", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that \"critics interested in multiculturalism\", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some \"apologetics\" have been written.<ref>Beegel (1996)</ref> Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, ''The Sun Also Rises'', in which a critic contended: \"Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.\" Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the \"horror of [[homosexuality]]\" and the \"[[racism]]\" typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction.<ref name=\"Beegel 1996 282\" /> In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: \"Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article294978/Susan-Beegel-What-I-like-about-Hemingway.html|title=Susan Beegel: What I like about Hemingway|website=kansascity.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Influence and legacy ==\n[[File:Statue of Hemingway at Floridita.jpg|thumb|Life-sized statue of Hemingway by [[Jos\u00e9 Villa Sober\u00f3n]], at [[El Floridita]] bar in [[Havana]]]]\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him either emulated or avoided it.<ref>Oliver (1999), 140\u2013141</ref> After his reputation was established with the publication of ''The Sun Also Rises'', he became the spokesperson for the post-World War&nbsp;I generation, having established a style to follow.<ref name=\"Nagel 1996 87\" /> His books were [[Nazi book burning|burned]] in Berlin in 1933, \"as being a monument of modern decadence\", and disavowed by his parents as \"filth\".<ref name=\"Hallengren\">Hallengren, Anders.
