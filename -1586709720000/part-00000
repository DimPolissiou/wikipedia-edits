The princely states did not form a part of [[British India]] (i.e. the presidencies and provinces), as they were not directly under British rule. The larger ones had treaties with Britain that specified which rights the princes had; in the smaller ones the princes had few rights. Within the princely states external affairs, defence and most communications were under British control.<ref>{{cite web|title=Provinces of British India|url=http://www.worldstatesmen.org/India_BrProvinces.htm|website=Worldstatesmen.org|publisher=Worldstatesmen|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> The British also exercised a general influence over the states' internal politics, in part through the granting or withholding of recognition of individual rulers. Although there were nearly 600 princely states, the great majority were very small and contracted out the business of government to the British.

The Act envisaged a system of \"double government\" in which the Council ideally served both as a check on excesses in imperial policy-making and as a body of up-to-date expertise on India. However, the Secretary of State also had special emergency powers that allowed him to make unilateral decisions, and, in reality, the Council's expertise was sometimes outdated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=96}}</ref> From 1858 until 1947, twenty-seven individuals served as Secretary of State for India and directed the [[India Office]]; these included: Sir [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]] (1859\u20131866), the [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] (1874\u20131878; later Prime Minister of Britain), [[John Morley]] (1905\u20131910; initiator of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]]), [[Edwin Montagu|E.

A system of \"double government\" had already been in place during the Company's rule in India from the time of Pitt's [[Pitt's India Act|India Act of 1784]]. The Governor-General in the capital, Calcutta, and the Governor in a subordinate presidency ([[Madras Presidency|Madras]] or [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]]) was each required to consult his advisory council; executive orders in Calcutta, for example, were issued in the name of \"Governor-General-in-Council\" (''i.e.'' the Governor-General with the advice of the Council). The Company's system of \"double government\" had its critics, since, from the time of the system's inception, there had been intermittent feuding between the Governor-General and his Council; still, the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance.<ref name=\"moore-426\" /> However, in the years immediately thereafter, which were also the years of post-rebellion reconstruction, Viceroy [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]] found the collective decision making of the Council to be too time-consuming for the pressing tasks ahead, so he requested the \"portfolio system\" of an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] in which the business of each government department (the \"portfolio\") was assigned to and became the responsibility of a single council member.<ref name=\"moore-426\"/> Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member, but important decisions required the consent of the Governor-General and, in the absence of such consent, required discussion by the entire Executive Council. This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]].\n\nIf the Government of India needed to enact new laws, the Councils Act allowed for a Legislative Council\u2014an expansion of the Executive Council by up to twelve additional members, each appointed to a two-year term\u2014with half the members consisting of British officials of the government (termed ''official'') and allowed to vote, and the other half, comprising Indians and domiciled Britons in India (termed ''non-official'') and serving only in an advisory capacity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=104}}</ref> All laws enacted by Legislative Councils in India, whether by the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] or by the provincial ones in [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], required the final assent of the Secretary of State in [[London]]; this prompted Sir Charles Wood, the second Secretary of State, to describe the Government of India as \"a despotism controlled from home\".<ref name=\"moore-426\"/> Moreover, although the appointment of Indians to the Legislative Council was a response to calls after the 1857 rebellion, most notably by [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]], for more consultation with Indians, the Indians so appointed were from the landed aristocracy, often chosen for their loyalty, and far from representative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=76}}</ref> Even so, the \"...&nbsp; tiny advances in the practice of representative government were intended to provide safety valves for the expression of public opinion, which had been so badly misjudged before the rebellion\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bayly|1990|p=195}}</ref> Indian affairs now also came to be more closely examined in the British Parliament and more widely discussed in the British press.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Bayly|1990|p=72}}</ref>\n\nWith the promulgation of the Government of India Act 1935, the Council of India was abolished with effect from 1 April 1937 and a modified system of government enacted. The Secretary of State for India represented the Government of India in the UK. He was assisted by a body of advisers numbering from 8\u201312 individuals, at least half of whom were required to have held office in India for a minimum of 10 years, and had not relinquished office earlier than two years prior to their appointment as advisers to the Secretary of State.<ref name=\"Constitution 1947\">p. 103\u201305, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref>\n\n{{Colonial India}}\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n\nThe Viceroy and Governor-General of India, a Crown appointee, typically held office for five years though there was no fixed tenure, and received an annual salary of Rs. 2,50,800 {{Abbr|p.a.|per annum}} (\u00a318,810 p.a.).<ref name=\"Constitution 1947\"/><ref>pp. 133\u201334, \"India \u2013 Currency, Weights and Measures,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref> He headed the Viceroy's Executive Council, each member of which had responsibility for a department of the central administration. From 1 April 1937, the position of Governor-General in Council, which the Viceroy and Governor-General concurrently held in the capacity of representing the Crown in relations with the Indian princely states, was replaced by the designation of \"HM Representative for the Exercise of the Functions of the Crown in its Relations with the Indian States\", or the \"Crown Representative\". The Executive Council was greatly expanded during the Second World War, and in 1947 comprised 14{{Nbsp}}members ([[Secretary to the Government of India|secretaries]]), each of whom earned a salary of Rs. 66,000 p.a.

The Viceroy was the head of the Council of State, while the Legislative Assembly, which was first opened in 1921, was headed by an elected President (appointed by the Viceroy from 1921\u20131925). The Council of State consisted of 58{{nbsp}}members (32{{Nbsp}}elected, 26{{Nbsp}}nominated), while the Legislative Assembly comprised 141{{nbsp}}members (26{{Nbsp}}nominated officials, 13{{Nbsp}}others nominated and 102{{Nbsp}}elected). The Council of State existed in five-year periods and the Legislative Assembly for three-year periods, though either could be dissolved earlier or later by the Viceroy. The Indian Legislature was empowered to make laws for all persons resident in British India including all British subjects resident in India, and for all British Indian subjects residing outside India. With the assent of the King-Emperor and after copies of a proposed enactment had been submitted to both houses of the British Parliament, the Viceroy could overrule the legislature and directly enact any measures in the perceived interests of British India or its residents if the need arose.<ref>p.\n106\u201307, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref>\n\nEffective from 1 April 1936, the Government of India Act created the new provinces of Sind (separated from the Bombay Presidency) and Orissa (separated from the Province of Bihar and Orissa). Burma and Aden became separate Crown Colonies under the Act from 1 April 1937, thereby ceasing to be part of the Indian Empire. From 1937 onwards, British India was divided into 17 administrations: the three Presidencies of Madras, Bombay and Bengal, and the 14 provinces of the United Provinces, Punjab, Bihar, the Central Provinces and Berar, Assam, the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), Orissa, Sind, British Baluchistan, Delhi, Ajmer-Merwara, Coorg, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Panth Piploda. The Presidencies and the first eight provinces were each under a Governor, while the latter six provinces were each under a Chief Commissioner. The Viceroy directly governed the Chief Commissioner provinces through each respective Chief Commissioner, while the Presidencies and the provinces under Governors were allowed greater autonomy under the Government of India Act.<ref>pp. 104\u201305, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">p. 108, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref> Each Presidency or province headed by a Governor had either a provincial bicameral legislature (in the Presidencies, the United Provinces, Bihar and Assam) or a unicameral legislature (in the Punjab, Central Provinces and Berar, NWFP, Orissa and Sind).

After the war, the British became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the rebellion and three main lessons were drawn. First, at a practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians\u2014not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in civilian life as well.<ref name=spear147>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=147}}</ref> The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=145\u201346}}: \"The army took on the form which survived till independence...

Consequently, no more land reforms were implemented for the next 90 years: Bengal and Bihar were to remain the realms of large land holdings (unlike the Punjab and [[Uttar Pradesh]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=150\u201351}}</ref>\n\nThird, the British felt disenchanted with Indian reaction to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like the ban on ''[[sati (practice)|sati]]'' by [[Lord William Bentinck]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=150}}</ref> It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion,<ref name=\"spear147-148\">{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=147\u201348}}</ref> even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows).<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=151}}</ref> This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion.

In the busiest centres houses are built close together, eave touching eave, and frequently back to back .... Space is so valuable that, in place of streets and roads, winding lanes provide the only approach to the houses.

New legislation merged the Crown and the old East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code as well as new codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s\u20131880s the Raj set up compulsory registration of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. [[Purdah]] rules prohibited women from saying their husband's name or having their photograph taken. An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice [[female infanticide]], prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Singha |first=Radhika |date=February 2003 |title=Colonial Law and Infrastructural Power: Reconstructing Community, Locating the Female Subject |journal=Studies in History |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=87\u2013126 |doi=10.1177/025764300301900105}}</ref>\n\nMurshid argues that women were in some ways more restricted by the modernisation of the laws. They remained tied to the strictures of their religion, caste, and customs, but now with an overlay of [[Victorian era|British Victorian]] attitudes. Their inheritance rights to own and manage property were curtailed; the new English laws were somewhat harsher. Court rulings restricted the rights of second wives and their children regarding inheritance. A woman had to belong to either a father or a husband to have any rights.<ref>Tazeen M. Murshid, \"Law and Female Autonomy in Colonial India\", ''Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh: Humanities'', (June 2002), 47#1 pp.&nbsp;25\u201342</ref>\n\n==Education==\n{{main|Macaulayism}}[[File:Lucknowuniversity.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Lucknow]], founded by the British in 1867]]\n\n[[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] (1800\u20131859) [[Whig history|presented his Whiggish interpretation of English history]] as an upward progression always leading to more liberty and more progress. Macaulay simultaneously was a leading reformer involved in transforming the educational system of India. He would base it on the English language so that India could join the mother country in a steady upward progress. Macaulay took Burke's emphasis on moral rule and implemented it in actual school reforms, giving the British Empire a profound moral mission to \"civilise the natives\".\n\nYale professor Karuna Mantena has argued that the civilising mission did not last long, for she says that benevolent reformers were the losers in key debates, such as those following the 1857 rebellion in India, and the scandal of [[Edward John Eyre|Edward Eyre]]'s brutal repression of the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in Jamaica in 1865. The rhetoric continued but it became an alibi for British misrule and racism. No longer was it believed that the natives could truly make progress, instead, they had to be ruled by heavy hand, with democratic opportunities postponed indefinitely. As a result:\n\n<blockquote>The central tenets of liberal imperialism were challenged as various forms of rebellion, resistance and instability in the colonies precipitated a broad-ranging reassessment....the equation of 'good government' with the reform of native society, which was at the core of the discourse of liberal empire, would be subject to mounting scepticism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mantena |first=Karuna |date=2010 |title=The Crisis of Liberal Imperialism |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/documents/11/dossier/pdf/HP11_Mantena_pdf_200510.pdf |journal=Histoire@Politique |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=3 |doi=10.3917/hp.011.0002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEnglish historian Peter Cain, has challenged Mantena, arguing that the imperialists truly believed that British rule would bring to the subjects the benefits of \u2018ordered liberty\u2019, thereby Britain could fulfil its moral duty and achieve its own greatness. Much of the debate took place in Britain itself, and the imperialists worked hard to convince the general population that the civilising mission was well under-way. This campaign served to strengthen imperial support at home, and thus, says Cain, to bolster the moral authority of the gentlemanly elites who ran the Empire.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = Peter J. | year = 2012 | title = Character, 'Ordered Liberty', and the Mission to Civilise: British Moral Justification of Empire, 1870\u20131914 | url = | journal = Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 557\u201378 | doi=10.1080/03086534.2012.724239}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Calcuttamedicalcollege1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The [[University of Calcutta]], established in 1857, is one of the three oldest modern [[State university (India)|state universities]] in India.]]\nUniversities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were established in 1857, just before the Rebellion.

The result was a very well educated professional state bureaucracy.

The Swadeshi movement consisted of the usage of natively produced goods. Once foreign goods were boycotted, there was a gap which had to be filled by the production of those goods in India itself. Bal Gangadhar Tilak said that the Swadeshi and Boycott movements are two sides of the same coin. The large Bengali Hindu middle-class (the ''[[Bhadralok]]''), upset at the prospect of Bengalis being outnumbered in the new Bengal province by Biharis and Oriyas, felt that Curzon's act was punishment for their political assertiveness. The pervasive protests against Curzon's decision took the form predominantly of the ''[[Swadeshi]]'' (\"buy Indian\") campaign led by two-time Congress president, [[Surendranath Banerjee]], and involved boycott of British goods.<ref>V.

Since the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Turkish Sultan]], or ''Khalifah'', had also sporadically claimed guardianship of the Islamic holy sites of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Jerusalem]], and since the British and their allies were now in conflict with Turkey, doubts began to increase among some Indian Muslims about the \"religious neutrality\" of the British, doubts that had already surfaced as a result of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|reunification of Bengal]] in 1911, a decision that was seen as ill-disposed to Muslims.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=200\u201301}}</ref> In the [[Lucknow Pact]], the League joined the Congress in the proposal for greater self-government that was campaigned for by Tilak and his supporters; in return, the Congress accepted separate electorates for Muslims in the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1916, the Muslim League had anywhere between 500 and 800{{nbsp}}members and did not yet have the wider following among Indian Muslims that it enjoyed in later years; in the League itself, the pact did not have unanimous backing, having largely been negotiated by a group of \"Young Party\" Muslims from the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (UP), most prominently, two brothers [[Maulana Mohammad Ali|Mohammad]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali|Shaukat Ali]], who had embraced the Pan-Islamic cause;<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\"/> however, it did have the support of a young lawyer from Bombay, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who was later to rise to leadership roles in both the League and the Indian independence movement.

Their propaganda also turned to posters, pamphlets, and political-religious songs, and later to mass meetings, which not only attracted greater numbers than in earlier Congress sessions, but also entirely new social groups such as non-[[Brahmin]]s, traders, farmers, students, and lower-level government workers.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/> Although they did not achieve the magnitude or character of a nationwide mass movement, the Home Rule leagues both deepened and widened organised political agitation for self-rule in India. The British authorities reacted by imposing restrictions on the Leagues, including shutting out students from meetings and banning the two leaders from travelling to certain provinces.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/>\n\nThe year 1915 also saw the return of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to India. Already known in India as a result of his civil liberties protests on behalf of the Indians in South Africa, Gandhi followed the advice of his mentor [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and chose not to make any public pronouncements during the first year of his return, but instead spent the year travelling, observing the country at first hand, and writing.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=214\u201315}}</ref> Earlier, during his South Africa sojourn, Gandhi, a lawyer by profession, had represented an Indian community, which, although small, was sufficiently diverse to be a microcosm of India itself. In tackling the challenge of holding this community together and simultaneously confronting the colonial authority, he had created a technique of non-violent resistance, which he labelled ''[[Satyagraha]]'' (or Striving for Truth).<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=210\u201313}}</ref> For Gandhi, ''Satyagraha'' was different from \"[[passive resistance]]\", by then a familiar technique of social protest, which he regarded as a practical strategy adopted by the weak in the face of superior force; ''Satyagraha'', on the other hand, was for him the \"last resort of those strong enough in their commitment to truth to undergo suffering in its cause\".<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/> [[Ahimsa]] or \"non-violence\", which formed the underpinning of ''Satyagraha'', came to represent the twin pillar, with Truth, of Gandhi's unorthodox religious outlook on life.<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/> During the years 1907\u20131914, Gandhi tested the technique of ''Satyagraha'' in a number of protests on behalf of the Indian community in South Africa against the unjust racial laws.<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/>\n\nAlso, during his time in South Africa, in his essay, ''Hind Swaraj'', (1909), Gandhi formulated his vision of ''[[Swaraj]]'', or \"self-rule\" for India based on three vital ingredients: solidarity between Indians of different faiths, but most of all between Hindus and Muslims; the removal of [[untouchability]] from Indian society; and the exercise of ''[[swadeshi]]''\u2014the boycott of manufactured foreign goods and the revival of Indian [[cottage industry]].<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/> The first two, he felt, were essential for India to be an egalitarian and tolerant society, one befitting the principles of Truth and ''[[Ahimsa]]'', while the last, by making Indians more self-reliant, would break the cycle of dependence that was perpetuating not only the direction and tenor of the British rule in India, but also the British commitment to it.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/> At least until 1920, the British presence itself was not a stumbling block in Gandhi's conception of ''[[swaraj]]''; rather, it was the inability of Indians to create a modern society.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131919: ''Satyagraha'', Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, Jallianwalla Bagh===\n[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|thumb|Gandhi at the time of the Kheda Satyagraha, 1918]]\n[[File:Montagu left.jpg|thumb |[[Edwin Montagu]], left, the [[Secretary of State for India]], whose report, led to the [[Government of India Act 1919]], also known as the Montford Reforms or the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]\n[[File:Rowlatt bills1919.gif|thumb|Headlines about the Rowlatt Bills (1919) from a nationalist newspaper in India.

When Gandhi was ordered to leave by the local British authorities, he refused on moral grounds, setting up his refusal as a form of individual [[Satyagraha]]. Soon, under pressure from the Viceroy in Delhi who was anxious to maintain domestic peace during wartime, the provincial government rescinded Gandhi's expulsion order, and later agreed to an official enquiry into the case. Although the British planters eventually gave in, they were not won over to the farmers' cause, and thereby did not produce the optimal outcome of a Satyagraha that Gandhi had hoped for; similarly, the farmers themselves, although pleased at the resolution, responded less than enthusiastically to the concurrent projects of rural empowerment and education that Gandhi had inaugurated in keeping with his ideal of ''swaraj''. The following year Gandhi launched two more Satyagrahas\u2014both in his native [[Gujarat]]\u2014one in the rural [[Kheda|Kaira]] district where land-owning farmers were protesting increased land-revenue and the other in the city of [[Ahmedabad]], where workers in an Indian-owned textile mill were distressed about their low wages. The satyagraha in Ahmedabad took the form of Gandhi fasting and supporting the workers in a strike, which eventually led to a settlement. In Kaira, in contrast, although the farmers' cause received publicity from Gandhi's presence, the satyagraha itself, which consisted of the farmers' collective decision to withhold payment, was not immediately successful, as the British authorities refused to back down. The agitation in Kaira gained for Gandhi another lifelong lieutenant in [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], who had organised the farmers, and who too would go on to play a leadership role in the Indian independence movement.<ref>Balraj Krishna, ''India's Bismarck, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel'' (2007) ch. 2</ref> Champaran, Kaira, and Ahmedabad were important milestones in the history of Gandhi's new methods of social protest in India.\n\nIn 1916, in the face of new strength demonstrated by the nationalists with the signing of the [[Lucknow Pact]] and the founding of the [[Home Rule Movement|Home Rule leagues]], and the realisation, after the disaster in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], that the war would likely last longer, the new Viceroy, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], cautioned that the Government of India needed to be more responsive to Indian opinion.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Towards the end of the year, after discussions with the government in London, he suggested that the British demonstrate their good faith\u2014in light of the Indian war role\u2014through a number of public actions, including awards of titles and honours to princes, granting of commissions in the army to Indians, and removal of the much-reviled cotton excise duty, but, most importantly, an announcement of Britain's future plans for India and an indication of some concrete steps. After more discussion, in August 1917, the new Liberal [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Montagu]], announced the British aim of \"increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, and the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire\".<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Although the plan envisioned limited self-government at first only in the provinces\u2014with India emphatically within the British Empire\u2014it represented the first British proposal for any form of representative government in a non-white colony.\n\nEarlier, at the onset of World War I, the reassignment of most of the British army in India to Europe and [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], had led the previous Viceroy, [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Harding]], to worry about the \"risks involved in denuding India of troops\".<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\"/> [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|Revolutionary violence]] had already been a concern in British India; consequently, in 1915, to strengthen its powers during what it saw was a time of increased vulnerability, the Government of India passed the [[Defence of India Act 1915]], which allowed it to intern politically dangerous dissidents without due process, and added to the power it already had\u2014under the 1910 Press Act\u2014both to imprison journalists without trial and to censor the press.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=201\u201302}}</ref> It was under the Defence of India act that the Ali brothers were imprisoned in 1916, and Annie Besant, a European woman, and ordinarily more problematic to imprison, was arrested in 1917.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\"/> Now, as constitutional reform began to be discussed in earnest, the British began to consider how new moderate Indians could be brought into the fold of constitutional politics and, simultaneously, how the hand of established constitutionalists could be strengthened. However, since the Government of India wanted to ensure against any sabotage of the reform process by extremists, and since its reform plan was devised during a time when extremist violence had ebbed as a result of increased governmental control, it also began to consider how some of its wartime powers could be extended into peacetime.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\"/>\n\nConsequently, in 1917, even as Edwin Montagu, announced the new constitutional reforms, a committee chaired by a British judge, S. A. T. Rowlatt, was tasked with investigating \"revolutionary conspiracies\", with the unstated goal of extending the government's wartime powers.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=203\u201304}}</ref> The Rowlatt Committee presented its report in July 1918 and identified three regions of conspiratorial insurgency: [[Bengal]], the [[Bombay presidency]], and the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> To combat subversive acts in these regions, the committee recommended that the government use emergency powers akin to its wartime authority, which included the ability to try cases of sedition by a panel of three judges and without juries, exaction of securities from suspects, governmental overseeing of residences of suspects,<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> and the power for provincial governments to arrest and detain suspects in short-term detention facilities and without trial.<ref name=spear190/>\n\nWith the end of World War I, there was also a change in the economic climate. By the end of 1919, 1.5{{nbsp}}million Indians had served in the armed services in either combatant or non-combatant roles, and India had provided \u00a3146{{nbsp}}million in revenue for the war.<ref name=\"brown195-196\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=195\u201396}}</ref> The increased taxes coupled with disruptions in both domestic and international trade had the effect of approximately doubling the index of overall prices in India between 1914 and 1920.<ref name=\"brown195-196\"/> Returning war veterans, especially in the Punjab, created a growing unemployment crisis,<ref name=stein304>{{Harvnb|Stein|2001|p=304}}</ref> and post-war inflation led to food riots in Bombay, Madras, and Bengal provinces,<ref name=stein304/> a situation that was made only worse by the failure of the 1918\u201319 monsoon and by profiteering and speculation.<ref name=\"brown195-196\"/> The global influenza epidemic and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 added to the general jitters; the former among the population already experiencing economic woes,<ref name=stein304/> and the latter among government officials, fearing a similar revolution in India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=208}}</ref>\n\nTo combat what it saw as a coming crisis, the government now drafted the Rowlatt committee's recommendations into two [[Rowlatt Acts|Rowlatt Bills]].<ref name=spear190>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=190}}</ref> Although the bills were authorised for legislative consideration by Edwin Montagu, they were done so unwillingly, with the accompanying declaration, \"I loathe the suggestion at first sight of preserving the Defence of India Act in peacetime to such an extent as Rowlatt and his friends think necessary.\"<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> In the ensuing discussion and vote in the Imperial Legislative Council, all Indian members voiced opposition to the bills. The Government of India was, nevertheless, able to use of its \"official majority\" to ensure passage of the bills early in 1919.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> However, what it passed, in deference to the Indian opposition, was a lesser version of the first bill, which now allowed extrajudicial powers, but for a period of exactly three years and for the prosecution solely of \"anarchical and revolutionary movements\", dropping entirely the second bill involving modification the [[Indian Penal Code]].<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Even so, when it was passed, the new [[Rowlatt Act]] aroused widespread indignation throughout India, and brought Gandhi to the forefront of the nationalist movement.<ref name=spear190/>\n\nMeanwhile, Montagu and Chelmsford themselves finally presented their report in July 1918 after a long fact-finding trip through India the previous winter.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=205\u201307}}</ref> After more discussion by the government and parliament in Britain, and another tour by the Franchise and Functions Committee for the purpose of identifying who among the Indian population could vote in future elections, the [[Government of India Act 1919]] (also known as the [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]) was passed in December 1919.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The new Act enlarged both the provincial and [[Imperial Legislative Council|Imperial]] legislative councils and repealed the Government of India's recourse to the \"official majority\" in unfavourable votes.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Although departments like defence, foreign affairs, criminal law, communications, and income-tax were retained by the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] and the central government in New Delhi, other departments like public health, education, land-revenue, local self-government were transferred to the provinces.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The provinces themselves were now to be administered under a new [[Diarchy|diarchical]] system, whereby some areas like education, agriculture, infrastructure development, and local self-government became the preserve of Indian ministers and legislatures, and ultimately the Indian electorates, while others like irrigation, land-revenue, police, prisons, and control of media remained within the purview of the British governor and his executive council.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The new Act also made it easier for Indians to be admitted into the civil services and the army officer corps.\n\nA greater number of Indians were now enfranchised, although, for voting at the national level, they constituted only 10% of the total adult male population, many of whom were still illiterate.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> In the provincial legislatures, the British continued to exercise some control by setting aside seats for special interests they considered cooperative or useful. In particular, rural candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational, were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Seats were also reserved for non-Brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The principal of \"communal representation\", an integral part of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]], and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact, was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for Muslims, [[Sikhs]], [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and Imperial legislative councils.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms offered Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power, especially at the provincial level; however, that opportunity was also restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Its scope was unsatisfactory to the Indian political leadership, famously expressed by [[Annie Beasant]] as something \"unworthy of England to offer and India to accept\".<ref name=Chhabra2>{{Harvnb|Chhabra|2005|p=2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] or \"Amritsar massacre\", took place in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] public garden in the predominantly Sikh northern city of [[Amritsar]].

In addition, Gandhi reorganised the Congress, transforming it into a mass movement and opening its membership to even the poorest Indians. Although Gandhi halted the non-cooperation movement in 1922 after the violent [[Chauri Chaura incident|incident at Chauri Chaura]], the movement revived again, in the mid-1920s.\n\nThe visit, in 1928, of the British [[Simon Commission]], charged with instituting constitutional reform in India, resulted in widespread protests throughout the country.<ref name=\"markovits-simon-bhagat\">{{Harvnb|Markovits|2004|pp=373\u201374}}</ref> Earlier, in 1925, non-violent protests of the Congress had resumed too, this time in Gujarat, and led by Patel, who organised farmers to refuse payment of increased land taxes; the success of this protest, the [[Bardoli Satyagraha]], brought Gandhi back into the fold of active politics.<ref name=\"markovits-simon-bhagat\"/>\n\n===1929\u20131937: Round Table conferences, Government of India Act===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\" widths=\"100\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Gandhi in London meeting, 1931.jpg | British prime minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], to the right of Gandhi at the 2nd Round Table Conference.

The declaration was drafted by the [[Congress Working Committee]], which included Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, and [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]]. Gandhi subsequently led an expanded movement of civil disobedience, culminating in 1930 with the [[Salt Satyagraha]], in which thousands of Indians defied the tax on salt, by marching to the sea and making their own salt by evaporating seawater. Although, many, including Gandhi, were arrested, the British government eventually gave in, and in 1931 Gandhi travelled to London to negotiate new reform at the [[Round Table Conferences]].\n\nIn local terms, British control rested on the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS), but it faced growing difficulties. Fewer and fewer young men in Britain were interested in joining, and the continuing distrust of Indians resulted in a declining base in terms of quality and quantity. By 1945 Indians were numerically dominant in the ICS and at issue was loyal divided between the Empire and independence.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Potter |first=David C. |date=January 1973 |title=Manpower Shortage and the End of Colonialism: The Case of the Indian Civil Service |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=47\u201373 |jstor=312036|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00004388 }}</ref> The finances of the Raj depended on land taxes, and these became problematic in the 1930s.

The act provided for a national parliament and an executive branch under the purview of the British government, but the rulers of the princely states managed to block its implementation.

The Act envisaged a system of \"double government\" in which the Council ideally served both as a check on excesses in imperial policy-making and as a body of up-to-date expertise on India. However, the Secretary of State also had special emergency powers that allowed him to make unilateral decisions, and, in reality, the Council's expertise was sometimes outdated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=96}}</ref> From 1858 until 1947, twenty-seven individuals served as Secretary of State for India and directed the [[India Office]]; these included: Sir [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]] (1859\u20131866), the [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Marquess of Salisbury]] (1874\u20131878; later Prime Minister of Britain), [[John Morley]] (1905\u20131910; initiator of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]]), [[Edwin Montagu|E.

A system of \"double government\" had already been in place during the Company's rule in India from the time of Pitt's [[Pitt's India Act|India Act of 1784]]. The Governor-General in the capital, Calcutta, and the Governor in a subordinate presidency ([[Madras Presidency|Madras]] or [[Bombay Presidency|Bombay]]) was each required to consult his advisory council; executive orders in Calcutta, for example, were issued in the name of \"Governor-General-in-Council\" (''i.e.'' the Governor-General with the advice of the Council). The Company's system of \"double government\" had its critics, since, from the time of the system's inception, there had been intermittent feuding between the Governor-General and his Council; still, the Act of 1858 made no major changes in governance.<ref name=\"moore-426\" /> However, in the years immediately thereafter, which were also the years of post-rebellion reconstruction, Viceroy [[Charles Canning, 1st Earl Canning|Lord Canning]] found the collective decision making of the Council to be too time-consuming for the pressing tasks ahead, so he requested the \"portfolio system\" of an [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|Executive Council]] in which the business of each government department (the \"portfolio\") was assigned to and became the responsibility of a single council member.<ref name=\"moore-426\"/> Routine departmental decisions were made exclusively by the member, but important decisions required the consent of the Governor-General and, in the absence of such consent, required discussion by the entire Executive Council. This innovation in Indian governance was promulgated in the [[Indian Councils Act 1861]].\n\nIf the Government of India needed to enact new laws, the Councils Act allowed for a Legislative Council\u2014an expansion of the Executive Council by up to twelve additional members, each appointed to a two-year term\u2014with half the members consisting of British officials of the government (termed ''official'') and allowed to vote, and the other half, comprising Indians and domiciled Britons in India (termed ''non-official'') and serving only in an advisory capacity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|2006|p=104}}</ref> All laws enacted by Legislative Councils in India, whether by the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] or by the provincial ones in [[Chennai|Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], required the final assent of the Secretary of State in [[London]]; this prompted Sir Charles Wood, the second Secretary of State, to describe the Government of India as \"a despotism controlled from home\".<ref name=\"moore-426\"/> Moreover, although the appointment of Indians to the Legislative Council was a response to calls after the 1857 rebellion, most notably by [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]], for more consultation with Indians, the Indians so appointed were from the landed aristocracy, often chosen for their loyalty, and far from representative.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=76}}</ref> Even so, the \"...&nbsp; tiny advances in the practice of representative government were intended to provide safety valves for the expression of public opinion, which had been so badly misjudged before the rebellion\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Bayly|1990|p=195}}</ref> Indian affairs now also came to be more closely examined in the British Parliament and more widely discussed in the British press.<ref>{{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=72}}, {{Harvnb|Bayly|1990|p=72}}</ref>\n\nWith the promulgation of the Government of India Act 1935, the Council of India was abolished with effect from 1 April 1937 and a modified system of government enacted. The Secretary of State for India represented the Government of India in the UK. He was assisted by a body of advisers numbering from 8\u201312 individuals, at least half of whom were required to have held office in India for a minimum of 10 years, and had not relinquished office earlier than two years prior to their appointment as advisers to the Secretary of State.<ref name=\"Constitution 1947\">p. 103\u201305, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref>\n\n{{Colonial India}}\n{{HistoryOfSouthAsia}}\n\nThe Viceroy and Governor-General of India, a Crown appointee, typically held office for five years though there was no fixed tenure, and received an annual salary of Rs. 2,50,800 {{Abbr|p.a.|per annum}} (\u00a318,810 p.a.).<ref name=\"Constitution 1947\"/><ref>pp. 133\u201334, \"India \u2013 Currency, Weights and Measures,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref> He headed the Viceroy's Executive Council, each member of which had responsibility for a department of the central administration. From 1 April 1937, the position of Governor-General in Council, which the Viceroy and Governor-General concurrently held in the capacity of representing the Crown in relations with the Indian princely states, was replaced by the designation of \"HM Representative for the Exercise of the Functions of the Crown in its Relations with the Indian States\", or the \"Crown Representative\".

The Viceroy was the head of the Council of State, while the Legislative Assembly, which was first opened in 1921, was headed by an elected President (appointed by the Viceroy from 1921\u20131925).

The Council of State existed in five-year periods and the Legislative Assembly for three-year periods, though either could be dissolved earlier or later by the Viceroy. The Indian Legislature was empowered to make laws for all persons resident in British India including all British subjects resident in India, and for all British Indian subjects residing outside India. With the assent of the King-Emperor and after copies of a proposed enactment had been submitted to both houses of the British Parliament, the Viceroy could overrule the legislature and directly enact any measures in the perceived interests of British India or its residents if the need arose.<ref>p.\n106\u201307, \"India \u2013 Government and Constitution,\" ''The Statesman's Year-Book 1947'', Steinberg, S.H., Macmillan, New York</ref>\n\nEffective from 1 April 1936, the Government of India Act created the new provinces of Sind (separated from the Bombay Presidency) and Orissa (separated from the Province of Bihar and Orissa).

The Presidencies and the first eight provinces were each under a Governor, while the latter six provinces were each under a Chief Commissioner.

After the war, the British became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the rebellion and three main lessons were drawn. First, at a practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians\u2014not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in civilian life as well.<ref name=spear147>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=147}}</ref> The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947.<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=145\u201346}}: \"The army took on the form which survived till independence... The Bengal army was completely recast...

Consequently, no more land reforms were implemented for the next 90 years: Bengal and Bihar were to remain the realms of large land holdings (unlike the Punjab and [[Uttar Pradesh]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=150\u201351}}</ref>\n\nThird, the British felt disenchanted with Indian reaction to social change. Until the rebellion, they had enthusiastically pushed through social reform, like the ban on ''[[sati (practice)|sati]]'' by [[Lord William Bentinck]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=150}}</ref> It was now felt that traditions and customs in India were too strong and too rigid to be changed easily; consequently, no more British social interventions were made, especially in matters dealing with religion,<ref name=\"spear147-148\">{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|pp=147\u201348}}</ref> even when the British felt very strongly about the issue (as in the instance of the remarriage of Hindu child widows).<ref>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=151}}</ref> This was exemplified further in Queen Victoria's Proclamation released immediately after the rebellion.

New legislation merged the Crown and the old East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code as well as new codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s\u20131880s the Raj set up compulsory registration of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. [[Purdah]] rules prohibited women from saying their husband's name or having their photograph taken. An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice [[female infanticide]], prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Singha |first=Radhika |date=February 2003 |title=Colonial Law and Infrastructural Power: Reconstructing Community, Locating the Female Subject |journal=Studies in History |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=87\u2013126 |doi=10.1177/025764300301900105}}</ref>\n\nMurshid argues that women were in some ways more restricted by the modernisation of the laws. They remained tied to the strictures of their religion, caste, and customs, but now with an overlay of [[Victorian era|British Victorian]] attitudes. Their inheritance rights to own and manage property were curtailed; the new English laws were somewhat harsher. Court rulings restricted the rights of second wives and their children regarding inheritance. A woman had to belong to either a father or a husband to have any rights.<ref>Tazeen M.

Macaulay simultaneously was a leading reformer involved in transforming the educational system of India. He would base it on the English language so that India could join the mother country in a steady upward progress. Macaulay took Burke's emphasis on moral rule and implemented it in actual school reforms, giving the British Empire a profound moral mission to \"civilise the natives\".\n\nYale professor Karuna Mantena has argued that the civilising mission did not last long, for she says that benevolent reformers were the losers in key debates, such as those following the 1857 rebellion in India, and the scandal of [[Edward John Eyre|Edward Eyre]]'s brutal repression of the [[Morant Bay rebellion]] in Jamaica in 1865. The rhetoric continued but it became an alibi for British misrule and racism. No longer was it believed that the natives could truly make progress, instead, they had to be ruled by heavy hand, with democratic opportunities postponed indefinitely. As a result:\n\n<blockquote>The central tenets of liberal imperialism were challenged as various forms of rebellion, resistance and instability in the colonies precipitated a broad-ranging reassessment....the equation of 'good government' with the reform of native society, which was at the core of the discourse of liberal empire, would be subject to mounting scepticism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mantena |first=Karuna |date=2010 |title=The Crisis of Liberal Imperialism |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/documents/11/dossier/pdf/HP11_Mantena_pdf_200510.pdf |journal=Histoire@Politique |volume=11 |issue=2 |page=3 |doi=10.3917/hp.011.0002}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEnglish historian Peter Cain, has challenged Mantena, arguing that the imperialists truly believed that British rule would bring to the subjects the benefits of \u2018ordered liberty\u2019, thereby Britain could fulfil its moral duty and achieve its own greatness. Much of the debate took place in Britain itself, and the imperialists worked hard to convince the general population that the civilising mission was well under-way. This campaign served to strengthen imperial support at home, and thus, says Cain, to bolster the moral authority of the gentlemanly elites who ran the Empire.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cain | first1 = Peter J. | year = 2012 | title = Character, 'Ordered Liberty', and the Mission to Civilise: British Moral Justification of Empire, 1870\u20131914 | url = | journal = Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 557\u201378 | doi=10.1080/03086534.2012.724239}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Calcuttamedicalcollege1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|The [[University of Calcutta]], established in 1857, is one of the three oldest modern [[State university (India)|state universities]] in India.]]\nUniversities in Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras were established in 1857, just before the Rebellion.

The system was overbuilt and too expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried. Christensen (1996), who looked at colonial purpose, local needs, capital, service, and private-versus-public interests, concluded that making the railways a creature of the state hindered success because railway expenses had to go through the same time-consuming and political budgeting process as did all other state expenses.

The League favoured the partition of Bengal, since it gave them a Muslim majority in the eastern half. In 1905, when Tilak and Lajpat Rai attempted to rise to leadership positions in the Congress, and the Congress itself rallied around the symbolism of [[Kali]], Muslim fears increased. The Muslim elite, including [[Dhaka Nawab Family|Dacca Nawab]] and [[Khwaja Salimullah]], expected that a new province with a Muslim majority would directly benefit Muslims aspiring to political power.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ludden|2002|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref>\n\nThe first steps were taken toward self-government in British India in the late 19th century with the appointment of Indian counsellors to advise the British viceroy and the establishment of provincial councils with Indian members; the British subsequently widened participation in legislative councils with the [[Indian Councils Act 1892|Indian Councils Act of 1892]]. [[Municipal Corporation]]s and District Boards were created for local administration; they included elected Indian members.\n\nThe [[Indian Councils Act 1909]], known as the Morley-Minto Reforms ([[John Morley]] was the secretary of state for India, and [[Gilbert John Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|Minto]] was viceroy)\u2014gave Indians limited roles in the central and provincial legislatures. Upper class Indians, rich landowners and businessmen were favoured. The Muslim community was made a separate electorate and granted double representation.

He announced the capital would be moved from Calcutta to Delhi. This period saw an increase in the activities of [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary groups]], which included Bengal's [[Anushilan Samiti]] and the Punjab's [[Ghadar Party]].

That, however, had to wait until the demise of Tilak's principal moderate opponents, [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and [[Pherozeshah Mehta]], in 1915, whereupon an agreement was reached for Tilak's ousted group to re-enter the Congress.<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\"/> In the 1916 Lucknow session of the Congress, Tilak's supporters were able to push through a more radical resolution which asked for the British to declare that it was their \"aim and intention&nbsp;... to confer self-government on India at an early date\".<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\"/> Soon, other such rumblings began to appear in public pronouncements: in 1917, in the [[Imperial Legislative Council]], [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] spoke of the expectations the war had generated in India, \"I venture to say that the war has put the clock&nbsp;... fifty years forward&nbsp;... (The) reforms after the war will have to be such,&nbsp;... as will satisfy the aspirations of her (India's) people to take their legitimate part in the administration of their own country.\"<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\"/>\n\nThe 1916 Lucknow Session of the Congress was also the venue of an unanticipated mutual effort by the Congress and the Muslim League, the occasion for which was provided by the wartime partnership between Germany and Turkey. Since the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Turkish Sultan]], or ''Khalifah'', had also sporadically claimed guardianship of the Islamic holy sites of [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Jerusalem]], and since the British and their allies were now in conflict with Turkey, doubts began to increase among some Indian Muslims about the \"religious neutrality\" of the British, doubts that had already surfaced as a result of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|reunification of Bengal]] in 1911, a decision that was seen as ill-disposed to Muslims.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=200\u201301}}</ref> In the [[Lucknow Pact]], the League joined the Congress in the proposal for greater self-government that was campaigned for by Tilak and his supporters; in return, the Congress accepted separate electorates for Muslims in the provincial legislatures as well as the Imperial Legislative Council. In 1916, the Muslim League had anywhere between 500 and 800{{nbsp}}members and did not yet have the wider following among Indian Muslims that it enjoyed in later years; in the League itself, the pact did not have unanimous backing, having largely been negotiated by a group of \"Young Party\" Muslims from the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh|United Provinces]] (UP), most prominently, two brothers [[Maulana Mohammad Ali|Mohammad]] and [[Maulana Shaukat Ali|Shaukat Ali]], who had embraced the Pan-Islamic cause;<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\"/> however, it did have the support of a young lawyer from Bombay, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], who was later to rise to leadership roles in both the League and the Indian independence movement. In later years, as the full ramifications of the pact unfolded, it was seen as benefiting the Muslim minority ''\u00e9lites'' of provinces like UP and Bihar more than the Muslim majorities of Punjab and Bengal; nonetheless, at the time, the \"Lucknow Pact\" was an important milestone in nationalistic agitation and was seen as such by the British.<ref name=\"brown-p200-201\"/>\n\nDuring 1916, two [[Home Rule Movement|Home Rule Leagues]] were founded within the Indian National Congress by Tilak and [[Annie Besant]], respectively, to promote [[Home Rule]] among Indians, and also to elevate the stature of the founders within the Congress itself.<ref name=\"brown-p199\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=199}}</ref> Mrs. Besant, for her part, was also keen to demonstrate the superiority of this new form of organised agitation, which had achieved some success in the [[Home Rule#Irish home rule|Irish home rule movement]], over the political violence that had intermittently plagued the subcontinent during the years 1907\u20131914.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/> The two Leagues focused their attention on complementary geographical regions: Tilak's in western India, in the [[Bombay presidency#Geography|southern Bombay presidency]], and Mrs. Besant's in the rest of the country, but especially in the [[Madras Presidency]] and in regions like [[Sindh|Sind]] and [[Gujarat]] that had hitherto been considered politically dormant by the Congress.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/> Both leagues rapidly acquired new members\u2014approximately thirty{{nbsp}}thousand each in a little over a year\u2014and began to publish inexpensive newspapers. Their propaganda also turned to posters, pamphlets, and political-religious songs, and later to mass meetings, which not only attracted greater numbers than in earlier Congress sessions, but also entirely new social groups such as non-[[Brahmin]]s, traders, farmers, students, and lower-level government workers.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/> Although they did not achieve the magnitude or character of a nationwide mass movement, the Home Rule leagues both deepened and widened organised political agitation for self-rule in India. The British authorities reacted by imposing restrictions on the Leagues, including shutting out students from meetings and banning the two leaders from travelling to certain provinces.<ref name=\"brown-p199\"/>\n\nThe year 1915 also saw the return of [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] to India. Already known in India as a result of his civil liberties protests on behalf of the Indians in South Africa, Gandhi followed the advice of his mentor [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] and chose not to make any public pronouncements during the first year of his return, but instead spent the year travelling, observing the country at first hand, and writing.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=214\u201315}}</ref> Earlier, during his South Africa sojourn, Gandhi, a lawyer by profession, had represented an Indian community, which, although small, was sufficiently diverse to be a microcosm of India itself. In tackling the challenge of holding this community together and simultaneously confronting the colonial authority, he had created a technique of non-violent resistance, which he labelled ''[[Satyagraha]]'' (or Striving for Truth).<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=210\u201313}}</ref> For Gandhi, ''Satyagraha'' was different from \"[[passive resistance]]\", by then a familiar technique of social protest, which he regarded as a practical strategy adopted by the weak in the face of superior force; ''Satyagraha'', on the other hand, was for him the \"last resort of those strong enough in their commitment to truth to undergo suffering in its cause\".<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/> [[Ahimsa]] or \"non-violence\", which formed the underpinning of ''Satyagraha'', came to represent the twin pillar, with Truth, of Gandhi's unorthodox religious outlook on life.<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/> During the years 1907\u20131914, Gandhi tested the technique of ''Satyagraha'' in a number of protests on behalf of the Indian community in South Africa against the unjust racial laws.<ref name=\"brown-p210-213\"/>\n\nAlso, during his time in South Africa, in his essay, ''Hind Swaraj'', (1909), Gandhi formulated his vision of ''[[Swaraj]]'', or \"self-rule\" for India based on three vital ingredients: solidarity between Indians of different faiths, but most of all between Hindus and Muslims; the removal of [[untouchability]] from Indian society; and the exercise of ''[[swadeshi]]''\u2014the boycott of manufactured foreign goods and the revival of Indian [[cottage industry]].<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/> The first two, he felt, were essential for India to be an egalitarian and tolerant society, one befitting the principles of Truth and ''[[Ahimsa]]'', while the last, by making Indians more self-reliant, would break the cycle of dependence that was perpetuating not only the direction and tenor of the British rule in India, but also the British commitment to it.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/> At least until 1920, the British presence itself was not a stumbling block in Gandhi's conception of ''[[swaraj]]''; rather, it was the inability of Indians to create a modern society.<ref name=\"brown-p214-215\"/>\n\n===1917\u20131919: ''Satyagraha'', Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, Jallianwalla Bagh===\n[[File:Gandhi Kheda 1918.jpg|thumb|Gandhi at the time of the Kheda Satyagraha, 1918]]\n[[File:Montagu left.jpg|thumb |[[Edwin Montagu]], left, the [[Secretary of State for India]], whose report, led to the [[Government of India Act 1919]], also known as the Montford Reforms or the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]\n[[File:Rowlatt bills1919.gif|thumb|Headlines about the Rowlatt Bills (1919) from a nationalist newspaper in India.

When Gandhi was ordered to leave by the local British authorities, he refused on moral grounds, setting up his refusal as a form of individual [[Satyagraha]]. Soon, under pressure from the Viceroy in Delhi who was anxious to maintain domestic peace during wartime, the provincial government rescinded Gandhi's expulsion order, and later agreed to an official enquiry into the case. Although the British planters eventually gave in, they were not won over to the farmers' cause, and thereby did not produce the optimal outcome of a Satyagraha that Gandhi had hoped for; similarly, the farmers themselves, although pleased at the resolution, responded less than enthusiastically to the concurrent projects of rural empowerment and education that Gandhi had inaugurated in keeping with his ideal of ''swaraj''. The following year Gandhi launched two more Satyagrahas\u2014both in his native [[Gujarat]]\u2014one in the rural [[Kheda|Kaira]] district where land-owning farmers were protesting increased land-revenue and the other in the city of [[Ahmedabad]], where workers in an Indian-owned textile mill were distressed about their low wages. The satyagraha in Ahmedabad took the form of Gandhi fasting and supporting the workers in a strike, which eventually led to a settlement. In Kaira, in contrast, although the farmers' cause received publicity from Gandhi's presence, the satyagraha itself, which consisted of the farmers' collective decision to withhold payment, was not immediately successful, as the British authorities refused to back down. The agitation in Kaira gained for Gandhi another lifelong lieutenant in [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel]], who had organised the farmers, and who too would go on to play a leadership role in the Indian independence movement.<ref>Balraj Krishna, ''India's Bismarck, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel'' (2007) ch. 2</ref> Champaran, Kaira, and Ahmedabad were important milestones in the history of Gandhi's new methods of social protest in India.\n\nIn 1916, in the face of new strength demonstrated by the nationalists with the signing of the [[Lucknow Pact]] and the founding of the [[Home Rule Movement|Home Rule leagues]], and the realisation, after the disaster in the [[Mesopotamian campaign]], that the war would likely last longer, the new Viceroy, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], cautioned that the Government of India needed to be more responsive to Indian opinion.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Towards the end of the year, after discussions with the government in London, he suggested that the British demonstrate their good faith\u2014in light of the Indian war role\u2014through a number of public actions, including awards of titles and honours to princes, granting of commissions in the army to Indians, and removal of the much-reviled cotton excise duty, but, most importantly, an announcement of Britain's future plans for India and an indication of some concrete steps. After more discussion, in August 1917, the new Liberal [[Secretary of State for India]], [[Edwin Montagu]], announced the British aim of \"increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration, and the gradual development of self-governing institutions, with a view to the progressive realisation of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire\".<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Although the plan envisioned limited self-government at first only in the provinces\u2014with India emphatically within the British Empire\u2014it represented the first British proposal for any form of representative government in a non-white colony.\n\nEarlier, at the onset of World War I, the reassignment of most of the British army in India to Europe and [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], had led the previous Viceroy, [[Charles Hardinge, 1st Baron Hardinge of Penshurst|Lord Harding]], to worry about the \"risks involved in denuding India of troops\".<ref name=\"brown-p197-198\"/> [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|Revolutionary violence]] had already been a concern in British India; consequently, in 1915, to strengthen its powers during what it saw was a time of increased vulnerability, the Government of India passed the [[Defence of India Act 1915]], which allowed it to intern politically dangerous dissidents without due process, and added to the power it already had\u2014under the 1910 Press Act\u2014both to imprison journalists without trial and to censor the press.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=201\u201302}}</ref> It was under the Defence of India act that the Ali brothers were imprisoned in 1916, and Annie Besant, a European woman, and ordinarily more problematic to imprison, was arrested in 1917.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\"/> Now, as constitutional reform began to be discussed in earnest, the British began to consider how new moderate Indians could be brought into the fold of constitutional politics and, simultaneously, how the hand of established constitutionalists could be strengthened. However, since the Government of India wanted to ensure against any sabotage of the reform process by extremists, and since its reform plan was devised during a time when extremist violence had ebbed as a result of increased governmental control, it also began to consider how some of its wartime powers could be extended into peacetime.<ref name=\"brown-p201-202\"/>\n\nConsequently, in 1917, even as Edwin Montagu, announced the new constitutional reforms, a committee chaired by a British judge, S. A. T. Rowlatt, was tasked with investigating \"revolutionary conspiracies\", with the unstated goal of extending the government's wartime powers.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=203\u201304}}</ref> The Rowlatt Committee presented its report in July 1918 and identified three regions of conspiratorial insurgency: [[Bengal]], the [[Bombay presidency]], and the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> To combat subversive acts in these regions, the committee recommended that the government use emergency powers akin to its wartime authority, which included the ability to try cases of sedition by a panel of three judges and without juries, exaction of securities from suspects, governmental overseeing of residences of suspects,<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> and the power for provincial governments to arrest and detain suspects in short-term detention facilities and without trial.<ref name=spear190/>\n\nWith the end of World War I, there was also a change in the economic climate. By the end of 1919, 1.5{{nbsp}}million Indians had served in the armed services in either combatant or non-combatant roles, and India had provided \u00a3146{{nbsp}}million in revenue for the war.<ref name=\"brown195-196\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=195\u201396}}</ref> The increased taxes coupled with disruptions in both domestic and international trade had the effect of approximately doubling the index of overall prices in India between 1914 and 1920.<ref name=\"brown195-196\"/> Returning war veterans, especially in the Punjab, created a growing unemployment crisis,<ref name=stein304>{{Harvnb|Stein|2001|p=304}}</ref> and post-war inflation led to food riots in Bombay, Madras, and Bengal provinces,<ref name=stein304/> a situation that was made only worse by the failure of the 1918\u201319 monsoon and by profiteering and speculation.<ref name=\"brown195-196\"/> The global influenza epidemic and the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 added to the general jitters; the former among the population already experiencing economic woes,<ref name=stein304/> and the latter among government officials, fearing a similar revolution in India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ludden|2002|p=208}}</ref>\n\nTo combat what it saw as a coming crisis, the government now drafted the Rowlatt committee's recommendations into two [[Rowlatt Acts|Rowlatt Bills]].<ref name=spear190>{{Harvnb|Spear|1990|p=190}}</ref> Although the bills were authorised for legislative consideration by Edwin Montagu, they were done so unwillingly, with the accompanying declaration, \"I loathe the suggestion at first sight of preserving the Defence of India Act in peacetime to such an extent as Rowlatt and his friends think necessary.\"<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> In the ensuing discussion and vote in the Imperial Legislative Council, all Indian members voiced opposition to the bills. The Government of India was, nevertheless, able to use of its \"official majority\" to ensure passage of the bills early in 1919.<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> However, what it passed, in deference to the Indian opposition, was a lesser version of the first bill, which now allowed extrajudicial powers, but for a period of exactly three years and for the prosecution solely of \"anarchical and revolutionary movements\", dropping entirely the second bill involving modification the [[Indian Penal Code]].<ref name=\"brown-p203-204\"/> Even so, when it was passed, the new [[Rowlatt Act]] aroused widespread indignation throughout India, and brought Gandhi to the forefront of the nationalist movement.<ref name=spear190/>\n\nMeanwhile, Montagu and Chelmsford themselves finally presented their report in July 1918 after a long fact-finding trip through India the previous winter.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\">{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=205\u201307}}</ref> After more discussion by the government and parliament in Britain, and another tour by the Franchise and Functions Committee for the purpose of identifying who among the Indian population could vote in future elections, the [[Government of India Act 1919]] (also known as the [[Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms]]) was passed in December 1919.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The new Act enlarged both the provincial and [[Imperial Legislative Council|Imperial]] legislative councils and repealed the Government of India's recourse to the \"official majority\" in unfavourable votes.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Although departments like defence, foreign affairs, criminal law, communications, and income-tax were retained by the [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy]] and the central government in New Delhi, other departments like public health, education, land-revenue, local self-government were transferred to the provinces.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The provinces themselves were now to be administered under a new [[Diarchy|diarchical]] system, whereby some areas like education, agriculture, infrastructure development, and local self-government became the preserve of Indian ministers and legislatures, and ultimately the Indian electorates, while others like irrigation, land-revenue, police, prisons, and control of media remained within the purview of the British governor and his executive council.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The new Act also made it easier for Indians to be admitted into the civil services and the army officer corps.\n\nA greater number of Indians were now enfranchised, although, for voting at the national level, they constituted only 10% of the total adult male population, many of whom were still illiterate.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> In the provincial legislatures, the British continued to exercise some control by setting aside seats for special interests they considered cooperative or useful. In particular, rural candidates, generally sympathetic to British rule and less confrontational, were assigned more seats than their urban counterparts.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Seats were also reserved for non-Brahmins, landowners, businessmen, and college graduates. The principal of \"communal representation\", an integral part of the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]], and more recently of the Congress-Muslim League Lucknow Pact, was reaffirmed, with seats being reserved for Muslims, [[Sikhs]], [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and domiciled Europeans, in both provincial and Imperial legislative councils.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> The Montagu-Chelmsford reforms offered Indians the most significant opportunity yet for exercising legislative power, especially at the provincial level; however, that opportunity was also restricted by the still limited number of eligible voters, by the small budgets available to provincial legislatures, and by the presence of rural and special interest seats that were seen as instruments of British control.<ref name=\"brown-p205-207\"/> Its scope was unsatisfactory to the Indian political leadership, famously expressed by [[Annie Beasant]] as something \"unworthy of England to offer and India to accept\".<ref name=Chhabra2>{{Harvnb|Chhabra|2005|p=2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] or \"Amritsar massacre\", took place in the [[Jallianwala Bagh]] public garden in the predominantly Sikh northern city of [[Amritsar]].

The declaration was drafted by the [[Congress Working Committee]], which included Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, and [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]]. Gandhi subsequently led an expanded movement of civil disobedience, culminating in 1930 with the [[Salt Satyagraha]], in which thousands of Indians defied the tax on salt, by marching to the sea and making their own salt by evaporating seawater.

Fewer and fewer young men in Britain were interested in joining, and the continuing distrust of Indians resulted in a declining base in terms of quality and quantity.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.

Green Poison became a pandemic, resulting in casualties and chaos on a global scale. Facing imminent social collapse, the United States government activated a contingent of domestic [[sleeper agents]] called the Strategic Homeland Division (SHD), or simply \"The Division\", to preserve order and continuity of government. Division agents leverage advanced technology and wide autonomy to deal with threats as they see fit. They are supplemented on the field with an advanced [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] system called ISAC.\n\nBy the beginning of ''The Division 2'', most government and military personnel have evacuated Washington D.C., which has descended into lawlessness. The [[White House]] is controlled by local Division agents and a coalition of first responders called the Joint Task Force (JTF), working to protect civilians and reestablish order. However, most of Washington D.C. has been carved into territories controlled by three competing militias: the Hyenas, a loose coalition of gangs, criminals, and anarchists taking advantage of the chaos for amusement and profit; the Outcasts, fanatical survivors of severe quarantines during the onset of the pandemic, seeking revenge on those they believe responsible for their imprisonment and eventual infection; and the True Sons, a highly organized and ruthless group of disgruntled JTF, [[US Armed Forces]], and paramilitary [[Mutiny|mutineers]] led by Colonel Antwon Ridgeway, who believes that security can only be restored through brutal [[authoritarianism]].\n\nAdditionally, the Acting [[President of the United States]], Andrew Ellis, is considered missing or [[killed in action]] since [[Air Force One]] crash landed near [[Capitol Hill]].\n\n=== Plot ===\nSeven months after the Green Poison outbreak, several Division agents are defending a civilian settlement from a bandit attack when the SHD Network, the system controlling their advanced technology and nationwide communications, suddenly shuts down. The Player's Agent receives a Division distress call from Washington D.C. as a new and larger force begins to attack the settlement. At a fellow agent's urging, they abandon the battle to respond to the call. The Agent arrives in Washington D.C. to find the Division and JTF's local base of operations, the White House, under attack by the Hyenas. After repelling the attack, the Agent is briefed by Manny Ortega, the city's Division controller. The Agent learns that most of the country\u2019s leadership is either dead or missing and the city is mostly controlled by three hostile factions: the Hyenas, the Outcasts, and the True Sons. Ortega instructs the Agent to work with fellow agent Alani Kelso to assist civilian settlements, liberate the city, and restore the SHD network.\n\nOrtega and Kelso uncover information that a cure to Green Poison might be located somewhere in the city, and that President Ellis may have survived the crash of [[Air Force One]] but is being held prisoner. Kelso is reluctant to waste time and resources to find Ellis, but Ortega points out that his security clearance may be needed to access the cure. The Agent eventually discovers Ellis and rescues him from Hyena custody. Ellis confirms that [[Antivirals|broad spectrum antivirals]] to cure not just Green Poison, but all viral infections, exist. However he can only access them with a special briefcase currently held in the True Sons' heavily fortified base at the [[United States Capitol]]. After the Agent repairs the SHD Network, reconnecting Division agents across the country, Ellis vows to restore the United States, no matter the cost. With the tide turning against them, the Hyenas, True Sons, and Outcasts retreat to their final strongholds. With the help of civilian militias and the JTF, the Agent assaults the strongholds and eliminates the leadership of most of the factions, with the Outcasts\u2019 leader Emelline Shaw disappearing during the assault on her stronghold on Roosevelt Island, while recovering Ellis' briefcase from the Capital.\n\nAs the Agent and the Division celebrate their victory, a new faction, the technologically advanced [[private military company]] Black Tusk, invades the city. Many of D.C.'s landmarks are quickly seized and Ellis suddenly goes missing with his briefcase, forcing the Agent to head out to find Ellis and repel the Black Tusk. The Agent eventually learns that Black Tusk supplied weapons to the gangs of D.C. and were responsible for sabotaging the SHD network, Ellis has been working with the Black Tusks all along, and that Ellis's predecessor, President Mendez, did not commit suicide as previously believed, but was assassinated by his own Secret Service detail on Black Tusk's orders. Thanks to Ellis, Black Tusk gains possession of the broad spectrum antivirals, planning to transport them out of the city. The Agent successfully raids Black Tusk's stronghold at [[Tidal Basin]], retrieving the antivirals and preventing a missile strike on the White House, although Ellis\u2019 location remains unknown.\n\n===Downloadable content===\n\n=====Episode 1 \u2013 D.C. Outskirts: Expedition=====\nFurther investigation reveals that Outcast leader, Emelline Shaw, survived the Division's assault at the aforementioned stronghold, and that she is currently at her new hideout at the Manning National Zoo. After fighting their way through the Zoo, the Agent manages to destroy Shaw\u2019s heavily armed monorail car and kill her.\n\nThe Agent then joins a large JTF task force in an attack on Camp White Oaks, a heavily wooded former presidential retreat north of DC, which has since been taken over by Black Tusk, with the objective of locating and capturing President Ellis. The main assault force is annihilated when the bridge they are crossing is destroyed by Black Tusk and the remaining team is eventually overrun while trying to secure the main helipad to prevent Ellis\u2019 escape, leaving the Agent to continue the mission alone. The Agent manages to reach the helipad too late as Ellis is evacuated by Black Tusk helicopter, disappearing for the second time.\n\nMeanwhile, the Agent is then sent on an expedition to Kenly College to investigate the recent disappearance of a JTF Squad, where the Outcasts have taken over the campus and severed communications.  There, the Agent removes the Outcasts securing stolen supplies at the College Library, infiltrates the Metro Station and water treatment facility underneath, and destroys the outcast base in the Student Union building.\n\n====Episode 2 \u2013 Pentagon: The Last Castle====\nThe Agent is sent to investigate [[the Pentagon]] after the Division detects heavy Black Tusk activity at the facility. Upon reaching the site, the Agent discovers that Black Tusk is setting up a massive drilling operation in order to access the DARPA laboratories underneath the Pentagon, which hold numerous experimental technologies. The Agent sabotages the drilling operation to delay Black Tusk before stealing data from their servers to figure out what they are after. It is revealed that Black Tusk are after a [[perfusion]] [[bioreactor]], capable of mass producing the antivirals the Division possesses.\n\nThe Agent proceeds into the DARPA lab to find Black Tusk attempting to smuggle the bioreactor out through the tunnel network beneath the Pentagon. The Agent is able to seize the bioreactor and transport it to a nearby helipad, eliminating Black Tusk forces so that the bioreactor can be extracted. Kelso congratulates the Agent, stating that even though they don't have staff qualified to operate the bioreactor yet, they are one step closer to ending the threat of Green Poison.\n\n==== Episode 3 \u2013 Coney Island: The Hunt ====\nThe Agent is sent to the ruins of [[Coney Island]] to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a virologist kidnapped by rogue Division agent Aaron Keener during the events of the previous game. Keener intends to hand Tchernenko over to Black Tusk at Coney Island in exchange for assistance with an unknown project. The Agent is tasked with rescuing Tchernenko to ensure his knowledge doesn't fall into Black Tusk's hands, and enlist his help in creating a vaccine. The Agent successfully infiltrates Black Tusk's defenses and has Tchernenko evacuated to Washington D.C.\n\nIt becomes apparent that Keener never intended to allow Black Tusk to leave with Tchernenko, as the island comes under attack by The Cleaners, a gang of deranged former [[DSNY]] workers that aims to violently purge any potential sources and carriers of the virus. Keener informed The Cleaners of Tchernenko's whereabouts, inciting them to attack Black Tusk so they can kill him. The Agent is forced to fight their way through the Cleaners and Black Tusk while hunting for Keener. After the Agent kills the Black Tusk's commander, Keener hijacks the video feed from a Division drone to gloat at the Agent about his successful [[Betrayal#Double cross|double cross]], escape, and ominous project.\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\n==== Warlords of New York ====\nThe Agent and Alani Kelso helicopter into New York City, answering a distress call from Faye Lau, leader of local Division operations. They find the JTF and Division's base in [[New York City Hall|City Hall]] devastated by a biological weapon deployed by Keener and his allies. The weapon is a newly engineered, instantaneously lethal, derivative of Green Poison called Eclipse. The Agent, Kelso, Lau, and JTF leader Roy Benitez regroup at Haven, a civilian settlement run by Paul Rhodes. \n\nAs Keener's whereabouts are unknown, the group decides to go after his [[Lieutenant|lieutenants]], who act as [[Warlord|warlords]] in four [[Lower Manhattan]] neighborhoods. Keener's warlords are fellow rogue agents convinced or coerced to work for him alongside local gangs: Theo Parnell, an engineering and computer systems expert stationed inside [[The Tombs]] of [[Civic Center, Manhattan|Civic Center]]; Vivian Conley, a chemical engineering expert who commands the Cleaners gang from a wrecked oil tanker in [[Two Bridges, Manhattan|Two Bridges]]; Javier Kajika, a covert and guerilla warfare expert based underneath [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]]; and James Dragov, a heavy weapons expert who commands the Rikers gang from the [[New York Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]].\n\nThe Agent eliminates the four warlords and recovers intelligence placing Keener on [[Liberty Island]]. The Agent and Kelso commandeer a ferry to Liberty Island, but are attacked by Black Tusk who have suddenly arrived in Manhattan to attack Keener as well. The Agent single-handily fights off Black Tusk to reach Keener's base inside the [[Statue of Liberty Museum]], discovering a [[Surface-to-surface missile|surface to surface missile]] system capable of delivering Eclipse payloads. Keener plans to launch a missile at Manhattan, killing everyone to enable the rise of a new society. The agent successfully destroys the system and defeats Keener in battle. A mortally wounded Keener activates a signal on his modified Division wristwatch before dying.\n\nKeener's signal activates ANNA, an AI analogue to ISAC developed by Parnell to network and coordinate rogue Division agents across the country. It's also revealed that Lau betrayed the Division to ally with Black Tusk at some point, and was their reason for arriving in Manhattan after Keener's location was known. Lau tells Bardon Schaeffer, Black Tusk's leader in Washington D.C., that Keener's rogue agent network will help them end the Division. Back in Haven, Rhodes and Benitez thank and congratulate the Agent, but lament Lau's betrayal. Kelso informs the Agent of a rogue agent cell activated in Washington D.C..\n\n== Development ==\nThe game was developed by [[Massive Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/|title=The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG 247]]|date=March 8, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> Evaluating the feedback from players regarding the [[Tom Clancy's The Division|first game]], Massive Entertainment planned to include more game content at launch and improve the endgame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-on-how-the-division-2-will-be-better-than-/1100-6459041/|title=Ubisoft On How The Division 2 Will Be Better Than The Division 1|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 18, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The game's endgame development was prioritized by Massive Entertainment after hearing players' complaints from the first game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-division-2s-developer-says-first-games-post-launch-response-was-a-nightmare|title=E3 2018: The Division 2's Developer Says First Game's Post-launch Response Was A Nightmare|first=Terri|last=Schwartz|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 11, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> The developers have said that the game's main campaign will take around 40 hours to beat, making it twice as long as the original game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gameskinny.com/wk543/the-division-2-how-long-is-the-campaign|title=The Division 2: How Long is the Campaign?|first=William|last=Parks|work=[[GameSkinny]]|date=January 20, 2019|accessdate=March 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe game was announced on March 9, 2018, by Ubisoft, with the first gameplay footage being premiered at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] in June 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-2-will-release-within-a-year-ubisoft-confirms/|title=The Division 2 will release within the next 12 months, Ubisoft confirms|first=Samuel|last=Horti|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=May 12, 2018|accessdate=June 12, 2018}}</ref> At the Expo, Ubisoft confirmed that the game will be released on March 15, 2019 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.vg247.com/2018/03/08/division-2-currently-works-massive-entertainment/ | title = The Division 2 is currently in the works at Massive Entertainment, more to come at E3 2018 | first=  Stephany | last = Nunnelly | date = March 8, 2018 | accessdate = March 8, 2018 | work = [[VG247]] }}</ref> A [[Software release life cycle#Beta|private beta]] was launched prior to the game's release.
