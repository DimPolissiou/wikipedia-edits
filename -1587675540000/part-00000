{"title_page": "Cabinet Crisis of 1964 in Malawi", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-165-1.jpg|thumb|[[Hastings Banda]], pictured on a visit to Tanzania in the 1960s, was at the heart of the Cabinet Crisis of 1964]]\nThe '''Cabinet Crisis of 1964''' in [[Malawi]] occurred in August and September 1964 shortly after independence when, after an unresolved confrontation between the Prime Minister, [[Hastings Banda]] (later Malawi's first President) and the cabinet ministers  present on 26 August 1964, three ministers and a parliamentary secretary were dismissed on 7 September. These dismissals were followed by the resignations of three more cabinet ministers and another parliamentary secretary, in sympathy with those dismissed. Initially, this only left the President and one other minister in post, although one of those who had resigned rescinded his resignation within a few hours. The reasons that the ex-ministers put forward for the confrontation and subsequent resignations were the autocratic attitude of Banda, who failed to consult other ministers and kept power in his own hands, his insistence on maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures. It is unclear whether the former ministers intended to remove Banda entirely, to reduce his role to that of a non-executive figurehead or simply to force him to recognise collective cabinet responsibility. Banda seized the initiative, firstly, by dismissing some of the dissidents rather than negotiating, and secondly, (after the resignations) by holding a [[debate]] on a [[Motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] on 8 and 9 September 1964. As the result of the debate was an overwhelming vote of confidence, Banda declined to reinstate any of the ministers or offer them any other posts, despite the urging of the [[Governor-General]] to compromise. After some unrest, and clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and of Banda, most of the former left Malawi in October with their families and leading supporters, for [[Zambia]] or [[Tanzania]]. One ex-minister, [[Henry Masauko Blasius Chipembere|Henry Chipembere]] went into hiding inside Malawi and, in February 1965 led a small, unsuccessful armed uprising. After its failure, he was able to arrange for his transfer to the USA. Another ex-minister, [[Yatuta Chisiza]], organised an even smaller incursion from Mozambique in 1967, in which he was killed. Several of the former ministers died in exile or, in the case of [[Orton Chirwa]] in a Malawian jail, but some survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and to return to public life.\n\nThe Cabinet Crisis, sometimes referred to as the '''Revolt of the Ministers''' is one of the most important but also most controversial episodes in the history of independent Malawi. Many of the contemporary documentary sources were written by expatriate diplomats and officials who were not close to the ex-ministers, and in some cases antipathetic to them. These accounts have been contradicted by the autobiographies, often written long after the event, of the ex-ministers themselves, although these are also inconsistent with one another. The principal published works quoted rely on a mixture of documentary sources and interviews with participants, both African and expatriate, and suggest that the crisis arose in a political culture that permitted no dissent, and treated attempts to debate issues as plotting.\n\n==Nyasaland African Congress==\n\n===Development of Congress===\nFor most of the colonial period, most Africans in [[Nyasaland]] had no political voice and only a small number of [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] had a very limited influence on the colonial government and they did not represent the interests of a growing body of African town dwellers. Most early African interest groups were local, represented only a small, mainly urban educated African elite and promoted their demands for a political voice, not independence. Only in the 1940s, with the formation of the [[Nyasaland African Congress]], did one organisation represent the whole of Nyasaland.<ref>van Velson (1966), Some Early Pressure Groups in Malawi, pp. 376-8, 400, 411.</ref> From 1944, various African local associations united into the [[Nyasaland African Congress]], which demanded African representation on the [[Legislative Council]] that advised the colonial governors.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 271, 313\u201316.</ref> From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to the formation of a federation of the three British territories in Central Africa, rather than their complete amalgamation, as the Southern Rhodesian government preferred: the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 62, 65\u20136.</ref> Federation radicalised some younger Congress members, and when in 1955 the [[Colonial Office]] agreed that the Legislative Council should include five African members nominated by Provincial Councils, they seized the opportunity. Although the Provincial Councils were largely composed of chiefs, their members were receptive to popular wishes, and they nominated Congress members or supporters to the Legislative Council. In 1956, Henry Chipembere and [[Kanyama Chiume]], two young radical members of Congress, were nominated together with two moderate Congress members and a Congress supporter. This success led to a rapid growth in Congress membership in 1956 and 1957.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 341\u20132.</ref>\n\nChipembere and Chiume were members of a new generation of pan-Africanist politicians, deeply influenced by Socialist and sometimes Marxist ideas and experiences acquired outside Malawi, who realised the value of a well-organised mass movement. Chipembere was a southerner, but many others were northerners. Chiume was born in the [[Nkhata Bay]] district but educated entirely in Tanganyika and Uganda. [[Dunduzu Chisiza]] and his elder brother, [[Yatuta Chisiza]], had been born in [[Karonga District]] before becoming a long-term residents of Uganda and Tanganyika. They were influenced both by [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kenneth Kaunda]]; Dunduzu  had also lived in Southern Rhodesia before being deported to Nyasaland for his political activities.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, p. 76.</ref> During the 1950s, these younger men displaced the older generation as leaders of Congress. They expressed hostility towards Europeanization, which cut them off from their cultural roots, an African middle class sympathising with Federation and the autocratic Chiefs. However, as they lacked status and knowledge of local African customs, they needed a charismatic older man as their leader. The chosen leader, Dr Banda, was sensitive to the country's political tradition. In preaching defiance of the \"stupid Federation\", Banda was in tune with the popular mood, but he also defended the chiefs and the rights of the older generation of educated men.<ref>M L Chanock, (1975). Ambiguities in the Malawian Political Tradition, p. 344.</ref>\n\n===Banda's return===\nThe younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in its leader, [[Thamar Dillon Thomas Banda|T D T Banda]], and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda, who had by then moved to the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]]. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed, he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 344\u20135.</ref>\n\nWhen Banda returned to Nyasaland, which he had left in 1915, he was over 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, but he saw himself as the leader of Congress and expected their obedience.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 207.</ref>\n\nBanda appointed Chipembere as Treasurer, Chiume as Publicity Secretary and [[Dunduzu Chisiza]] as Secretary-general of Congress.  He also appointed four other young radicals to the party's Executive Committee, ignoring older moderates, but made it clear that he regarded his appointees as subordinates, not colleagues. Although these appointees had senior positions, these came with a heavy workload and tied them to the MCP headquarters in [[Blantyre]], away from their grassroots support.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 6\u20137.</ref> In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, Banda combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them. He used these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, disobedience and protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 347\u201349.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 155.</ref>\n\n==The 1959 Emergency==\n\n===Background===\nIn January 1958, Banda presented Congress proposals for an African majority in the Legislative Council to the governor, Sir [[Robert Perceval Armitage|Robert Armitage]]. As this would have led to a demand for withdrawal from the Federation, Armitage refused. This breakdown in talks led to Congress demands for more violent anti-government action, and leading Congress activists made increasingly inflammatory statements. Armitage was influenced by reports from police informers, who claimed Congress planned the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of its African opponents, the so-called \"murder plot\". There is no evidence that a murder plot existed, but the refusal of Banda or other Congress leaders to condemn the violent actions of Congress members gave it some plausibility. Armitage prepared for mass arrests and, on 20 February, troops from Rhodesia were flown into Nyasaland. In the days following 20 February, both Chipembere and Yatuta Chisiza  made a number of provocative speeches, many followed by disturbances,  and the police or troops fired on some of these, leading to four deaths.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 296\u20137.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 296, 349\u201351.</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1959 Armitage declared a [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]] over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Banda, other members of the Congress executive committee and over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded.<ref>C Baker, (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28.</ref> By the night of 3 March, most principal Congress leaders had been arrested and detained. Some were released very quickly, but 72 prominent detainees, including Banda, were flown to Southern Rhodesia. Others were detained in Nyasaland. In the immediate aftermath of arrest, 21 people were killed and many wounded.<ref>C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 40\u20132, 48.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWithin two days of the declaration of the state of emergency, the British [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] under [[Harold Macmillan]] decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances. Macmillan did not choose its chairman, Devlin, and later criticised his appointment on the basis of his Irish ancestry and Catholic upbringing. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival [[Armitage Report]], which was prepared very quickly so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report.<ref>A Horne, (2008) Macmillan: The Official Biography, pp. 180\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe [[Devlin Commission]] concentrated on three areas: the State of Emergency, the murder plot and African opposition to Federation. It found that the declaration of a State of Emergency was necessary to restore order and prevent a descent into anarchy, but it criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops. It also found that the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism and of support for Congress justified calling it a \"police state\". Its strongest criticism was over the \"murder plot\", which it said not exist, and the use made of it by both the Nyasaland and British governments in trying to justify the Emergency, which it condemned. It also declared that Banda had no knowledge of the inflammatory talk of some Congress activists about attacking Europeans. Finally, it noted the almost universal rejection of Federation by Nyasaland's African people and suggested the British government should negotiate with African leaders on the country's constitutional future.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 356, 359.</ref><ref>C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe Nyasaland government had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. At first, the British government tried to calm the situation by nominating additional African members (who were not Congress supporters) to the Legislative Council.  However, it soon decided that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained and that Nyasaland and [[Northern Rhodesia]] should be given responsible government under majority rule. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Banda was released in April 1960 and invited to London to discuss proposals for responsible government.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 287\u201394, 296\u20139, 309\u201313.</ref>\n\nChipembere, Dunduzu Chisiza and his brother Yatuta were arrested in the State of Emergency and imprisoned with Banda for 13 months in [[Gweru|Gwelo]] in Southern Rhodesia, but Chiume, who was in London, escaped arrest. This did little to bring Banda and the others together: Banda became concerned with Chipembere's volatile temper, and Banda's increasingly authoritarian attitudes alarmed his three fellow prisoners. Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers remained in detention, first in Rhodesia and later in Nyasaland, after Banda was released. [[Iain Macleod]], the Colonial Secretary was at first suspicious of Banda, and regarded the three others as extremists. He eventually agreed to Banda's request for their release, but they were among the last to be released in September 1960.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 377.</ref> This was after Banda had returned from constitutional talks in London, where he had been accompanied by Orton Chirwa, a lawyer and [[Aleke Banda]], a young activist. In May 1960, Chiume returned to Nyasaland and his attempts to ingratiate himself with Banda led to his estrangement from Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers. After his release, Chipembere embarked on a series of fiery speeches: the colonial authorities considered these were sufficiently threatening to warrant his arrest, and he was again imprisoned, receiving a three-year sentence  in January 1961. Chiume escaped prosecution for his speeches, as he was considered of lower importance. Chipembere was still in prison in August 1961, when Banda (who had insisted on selecting all his party's candidates) won an overwhelming electoral victory. The new Governor, [[Glyn Smallwood Jones]] was willing to discuss Chipembere's early release but despite Dunduzu Chisiza's urging, Banda allowed Chipembere to serve much of his sentence until his release in January 1963. In August 1961, Chipembere's father had been elected to the Legislative Council in place of his son, but gave up his seat on Chipembere's release.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 9, 14, 27.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 209\u201311.</ref>\n\n==The Malawi Congress Party==\n\n===Formation===\nChirwa and Aleke Banda had only been detained for a short time and in 1959 they had formed the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP) to replace the banned Nyasaland African Congress, making it clear that they were acting on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. The reconstitution of Congress as the Malawi Congress Party from September 1959 marked a major shift in its character. The Nyasaland African Congress was an anti-colonial liberation movement but after the 1961 elections, the MCP was in government. There was a regional shift in support for the MCP: in both the Southern and Central Provinces, people flocked to join the party but, in the north, branches were formed only in a limited number of places. The MCP quickly emerged as a larger party, distinctly more authoritarian in its approach, than Congress had been. It became a mass party, but Chipembere and the Chisizas were unknown to many of the new members, who regarded Banda as the sole leader.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 76, 80-1.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 198.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Nyasaland general election, 1961|1961 elections]], MPC won 22 out of the 28 available Legislative Council seats, including all the \"lower roll\" seats, which had a predominantly African electorate. The largest group of MPC Legislative Council members was formed of eight who had received at least secondary education, mainly former students; five of the six early ministerial appointments fell to this group. They were generally under 35 (only Chirwa was over 40), and a disproportionate number of these came from the [[Northern Region, Malawi|Northern Region]], because several mission schools there taught to a high standard. The next group was of local MCP bosses who were generally a decade older than the first group. They were generally less well educated but had stronger local ties, and after the 1964 crisis, several of them replaced the former ministers of the first group. At first, MPC backbench members raised questions on sensitive issues and questioned ministers with relative freedom, but by late 1962, this had ceased and only the few non-MCP Legislative Council members were able to offer any criticism. Banda started to intervene in the speeches of ministers and to cut short debates, arguing that he alone made policy.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 381, 403-4.</ref>\n\nBefore the elections, the Colonial Office had assumed that MPC would be entitled to three Executive Council seats through winning a majority of the \"lower roll\" seats. As the Lancaster House agreement provided that two Executive Council seats would go to ministers elected by the \"upper roll\" of largely European and Asian electors, it was thought that the mainly white [[United Federal Party]] would gain both these seats: with five officials also sitting, there would be a non-MCP majority on the Executive Council. In the event, the United Federal Party only won five Legislative Council seats, two going to MPC and one to an MCP-inclined independent, [[Colin Cameron (Malawian politician)|Colin Cameron]]. The Governor offered the United Federal Party a single Executive Council seat, which it refused. This left all five elected seats for MCP candidates. In theory, Jones, the Governor, was entitled to allocate portfolios, but he allowed Banda to make nominations. Banda decided to take two for himself, becoming both Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Local Government. Chiume became Minister of Education and [[Augustine Bwanausi]] became Minister of Labour. The two upper roll ministers were Colin Cameron (Minister of Works) and Mikeka Mkandawire as Minister without Portfolio. Two MCP parliamentary secretaries were also appointed, but did not sit in the Executive Council. These were Dunduzu Chisiza in the Ministry of Finance and Orton Chirwa in the Ministry of Justice. Two additional appointments were made in March 1962, of [[John Msonthi]] and [[Willie Chokani]], and Chirwa became the Minister of Justice and [[Attorney-general]] at the start of 1964.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 381\u20132.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 45.</ref>\n\n===In government===\nWhen Banda and four other MCP ministers joined five officials on the Executive Council, they formed a [[Responsible government]] accountable to the Governor. A timetable for full self-government independence was agreed at a constitutional conference in London in 1962 and the Jones allowed Banda and the MPC ministers and parliamentary secretaries, now seven in total, to initiate policies. Nyasaland achieved internal self-government with Banda as Prime Minister in February 1963. Full independence was gained (and the country's name became Malawi) on 6 July 1964, with Banda as Prime Minister. Malawi became a republic within the Commonwealth, on 6 July 1966, when Banda became its first President.<ref>J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 159, 170.</ref><ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 313.</ref>\n\nIn February 1963, Banda, as Prime Minister, was able to select a cabinet of 10 members to replace the Executive Council. This included the temporary appointment of [[Sir Henry Phillips|Henry Phillips]] the former Financial Secretary as Minister of Finance, the post Dunduzu Chisiza would have taken but for his death in 1962. Other official members left office. Chipembere joined the cabinet as Minister of Local Government, and Chiume added Social Development to his Education post. There were some changes of portfolios: Willie Chokani took over as Minister of Labour, replacing Augustine Bwanausi, who became Minister of the Interior, and [[John Tembo]] was made a parliamentary secretary, with the intention of his replacing Phillips, who retired in early 1964. The Governor suggested that Bwanausi had more experience and would be a better choice as Minister of Finance, but Banda was insistent on Tembo. Msonthi and Cameron retained their existing posts and Mkandawire left the cabinet by his own choice. At this time, Aleke Banda, a close aide to Banda, was made MCP secretary-general.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 80\u20131, 91-2, 95-6, 333.</ref>\n\nGenerally, the MCP ministers were very active in their new roles and, although there was some friction with permanent officials, they were effective <ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 388.</ref> Banda, as Minister of Natural Resources (which included farming), introduced three crucial reforms, the abolition of punitive element of conservation practices (although not the conservation measures themselves), the final abolition of [[thangata]] through the Africans on Private Estates Act in 1962, and the reform of the marketing of peasant crops.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 390\u20132.</ref> Chiume, the Minister of Education, promoted the expansion of secondary education, the creation of a teacher training college and a polytechnic and sending Malawian students to overseas universities, pending the creation of a university in Malawi. The last led to accusations of favouring fellow-northerners when granting scholarships. Chiume, an abrasive personality, more controversially attacked the hold of the missions on education and insisted on bringing them under greater state control.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 400\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Banda's leadership===\nSoon after the Lancaster House constitutional conference in 1962, Banda made it clear in the Legislative Council that he alone was responsible for making policy, which the ministers were to execute without debate or dissent. No criticism of Banda was permitted, but Banda allowed ministers to criticise each other and did not counter claims that the significant number of ministers from the north were favouring fellow northerners. Chiume in particular was involved in disputes with Cameron, the Minister of Works and Dunduzu Chisiza the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance.  In August 1962, both Cameron and Chisiza offered their resignations to the Governor but were persuaded to remain in post; Chisiza died shortly afterwards. Banda was accused of building-up an entourage based on his own [[Chewa language|Chewa]] group, but before the 1963 election, he held the balance between competing MCP factions.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 403, 406-7.</ref>\n\nDunduzu Chisiza had died in September 1962, apparently in a car crash, although many people in Malawi continue to believe he was murdered on Banda's instructions. Although the balance of probabilities is that Chisiza's death was accidental, it is clear that before his death, he saw the possibility of a dictatorship as a major threat. His preference was for a strong central government uniting all sectional interests and allowing dissenting views to be expressed. In a pamphlet written shortly before his death, he argued that, whereas it was necessary for the strong leadership of one individual and acceptance of his decisions during an independence struggle, once independence had been achieved, the former subordinates should cease to be submissive. He considered that a leader surrounded only by willing subordinates would soon become dictatorial; a prescient claim in view of Banda's later actions. Chisiza agreed with Banda on many issues, however on others he dissented more, and more publicly, than any other minister.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 410\u20132.</ref>\n\n==Independence==\nUntil Banda was sworn in as Prime Minister on 1 February 1963, the Governor retained the ultimate responsibility for law and order. Immediately after this, despite some attacks by MCP militants on [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and members of opposition parties, the situation was generally calm until the [[Nyasaland general election, 1964|pre-independence election]] campaign began in late 1963. By January 1964, almost every opposition leader had fled the country and over 1,800 attacks on political opponents of the MPC and Jehovah's Witnesses were recorded in January and February 1964. This violence was orchestrated by local MCP bosses, but Banda did little to stop it,<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 418\u201320.</ref>\n\nIn July 1963, Banda took over Msonthi's portfolio of Transport and Communication and removed him from the cabinet without giving any reason, although Chipembere later stated it was probable that Msonthi was suspected of corruption, and others mentioned his drinking. At the time, other ministers suspected that Banda had removed Msonthi to test their reaction to an arbitrary sacking. Banda also claimed in cabinet that he had considered dismissing other (unnamed) ministers, and the whole affair increased ministerial insecurity. Msonthi was reappointed to the cabinet in August 1963, and soon after the three MCP regional chairmen were given ministerial status, diluting the influence of existing ministers.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965, pp. 91\u20132, 95-6, 333.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 430.</ref>\n\nDifferences between Banda and the ministers arose for several reasons. Firstly, Banda insisted on making all the important decisions relating to the state and the MCP, including nominating all the candidates for election, and he refused to devolve real responsibility to them. Within the MCP, Banda set up a new committee to strengthen and centralise party discipline, reducing local control. He also became life president of the MCP in February 1963. After the 1963 election, Banda began to make slighting references to the ministers in speeches.  Earlier, his criticism had been in private, but on 27 October 1963, he berated them in a long public speech. More privately, he accused Chipembere, Chiume and Bwanausi of forming a cabal against him. In November 1963, he took over Chiume's ministerial responsibilities for Education and Social Development without removing him from the cabinet, where he was given responsibility for the transition to independence. Chipembere then became Minister of Education. Banda later claimed this was done to drive a wedge between Chipembere and Chiume. In a further cabinet reshuffle, Yatutza Chisiza took on Home Affairs and Bwanausi moved to Development and Transport. Banda himself retained the Trade and Industry, Health, Natural Resources and Social Development portfolios as well as being Prime Minister. His holding so many posts and devolving the day-to-day work to parliamentary secretaries was criticised, as was the frequency with which he shifted ministers around. Banda's appointment of his followers to statutory bodies also appeared to diminish the power and influence of existing ministers.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 80\u20131.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965, pp. 91\u20132, 95-6, 333.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 403\u20134.</ref>\n\nSecondly, Banda continued diplomatic relations with [[South Africa]] and [[Portugal]], but refused to recognise the People's Republic of [[China]] or [[East Germany]], despite most ministers' ideological concerns, and contemptuously rejected attempts by Chiume and Yatuta Chisiza to form closer ties with Zambia and [[Tanzania|Tanganyika]]. Thirdly, the slow pace of [[Africanization]] in the Civil Service, the freezing of Civil Service salaries and the introduction of a charge for outpatients at state hospitals were not seen as passing the benefits of independence to the people.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317\u20138.</ref>\n\n==The Cabinet Crisis==\n\n===Initial disagreements===\nSince the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, there has been disagreement on the extent to which rivalries within the MCP in the early 1960s reflected generational and ideological tensions between Dr Banda and his younger ministers or regional divisions. Following the release of the Chisiza brothers and Chipembere in October 1960, the influence of northerners appeared to grow, reaching a peak in September 1961 when Yatuta Chisiza was appointed the party's Administrative Secretary alongside his brother, Dunduzu, the Secretary General; Chiume was Publicity Secretary; Orton Chirwa was Legal Adviser; and Rose Chibambo, the only woman on the party's National Executive, was Chairman of the Woman's League. This apparent northern dominance, masked divisions and politicians born in the north pursued various personal and ideological agendas and did not act as a regional bloc. After the Lancaster House conference made it clear that independence would be achieved, MCP became a more divided party. The focus moved away from achieving independence towards the allocation of resources between ministries and regions. Resentment of the hold that better-educated northerners had on scarce jobs was used by Banda to assert his authority by playing ministers off against one another, but there is no evidence of him adopting a pro-[[Chewa people|Chewa]], anti-northern stance before the 1964 crisis. None of the ministers who resigning in 1964 drew attention to regional distinctions, but Banda's allies from the [[Central Region, Malawi|Central Region]] accused northern politician in general and Chiume in particular of favouritism, and voiced Chewa resentment against senior civil servants from the north, many of whom had demonstrated in favour of the former ministers. Rose Chibambo came in for particularly violent abuse, probably because of anti-female as well as anti-northern prejudice.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 80\u20131, 83-4.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 404\u20135, 435-6.</ref>\n\nColin Cameron, the only European minister remaining at independence on 6 July 1964, stated that, at that time, all the African ministers apart from Chiume had decided to press for rapid [[Africanization]] and links with other African states, and to end Banda's dictatorial behaviour. On his return from a visit to Cairo on 26 July, Banda made a public speech threatening ministers; this had the perverse effect of uniting them all, including Chiume. Banda's proposal to reintroduce detention without trial at the cabinet meeting of 29 July 1964 united all the ministers against him, but only Colin Cameron resigned. Chipembere later explained that the other ministers did not resign as detention was a popular issue they could not oppose, but they hoped it would be used sparingly.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 72.</ref> On 10 August, the ministers attending (Tembo was not present, and Chiume was probably also absent) asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. Chipembere later recorded that Banda gave them a hearing, but was concerned that they were \"ganging up\" against him, and was reluctant to meet them as a group. However, Banda appeared to accept their concerns and apologised about the hurtful remarks he had made about them.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72\u20133.</ref>\n\n===The ministers complain===\nAt the cabinet meeting of 26 August 1964, all the ministers present (including to some degree John Tembo) raised their concerns about Banda's failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position. The ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances: he made no immediate answer, neither accepting or rejecting what the list contained.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 431, 451.</ref><ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317\u20138.</ref> Banda was apparently surprised by the strength of the opposition at this cabinet meeting, even though his recent relations with Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza had been difficult. A number of ministers led by Chisiza apparently wished to convert Banda's role from that of Prime Minister, with an expected progression to become executive President, to be in the future a President without executive functions, with an appointed Prime Minister as head of government. Chiume had been a prominent supporter of Banda and, since 1959, had not been close to the more radical group. However, once Banda had strongly rejected his plan to accept aid from China, Chiume began to attack him, and precipitated the confrontation of 26 August 1964.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 159\u201360.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p 212.</ref>\n\nThe ministers thought that their united stand had been successful. They did not know that Banda had already decided not to agree to their demands, but wanted to test how strong his support was by consulting MCP leaders before taking action. He also had Special Branch reports on the ministers, to assess their likely reaction to the dismissal of some of their colleagues. On 31 August, Banda told his expatriate cabinet secretary that he intended to have no further discussions with the ministers. He intended to resign as Prime Minister, but only because it would automatically end the tenure of the other ministers: on reappointment he would form a new cabinet without Chipembere, Chiume and Chisiza, but with the addition of four new ministers loyal to him. On 1 September, he advised the Governor-general of his intention not to reappoint Chiume or Chisiza: he said Chipembere and Msonthi might also be dropped.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 77.</ref>\n\nAt a further meeting with the ministers, excluding Chipembere who was in Canada, on 2 September 1964, Banda made no concessions to the ministers, and the meeting ended in chaos, with Banda ordering them out of the cabinet room. The ministers then met and proposed that Banda should be forced to resign, with Chirwa becoming Prime minister and Chipembere left out of the cabinet. After the abortive cabinet meeting, Banda contacted the Governor-general, who advised him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament rather than resign. His success there in the Malawi parliament in 1964 was a foregone conclusion, as it had no opposition party members and as all the MCP members were personally nominated by Banda.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 78.</ref>\n\n===The confidence vote===\nOn 7 September at an informal meeting, Banda appealed to Members of Parliament to support him in a vote of confidence to be held after a debate on 8 and 9 September. Also on 7 September, Banda called upon Glyn Jones, as Governor-general to issue dismissal letters to Chirwa, Chiume, and Bwanausi, who all accepted their dismissals with dignity. [[Rose Chibambo]], a parliamentary secretary, was also dismissed. The other cabinet members, except for John Tembo, showed solidarity with their colleagues. On the same day, Yatuta Chisiza, Chokani and, after some hesitation, Msonthi handed their resignations to the Governor-general. Chokani later claimed that Jones urged him not to resign and, after taking advice, Msonthi withdrew his resignation a few hours later: Banda immediately accepted this. Jones then suggested a meeting between the other resigning ministers and Banda, but Chisiza and Chokani declined. It is not clear whether, having dismissed Chiume, Chirwa and Bwanausi, Banda expected Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza to continue in office, but they resigned.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 162\u20133.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 220\u20131.</ref> None of the ministers who were dismissed or who had resigned made any significant effort to mobilise support from other Members of Parliament, most of whom owed their nominations to Banda, although they had significant support from African civil servants.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 431\u20133.</ref>\n\nTembo and Msonthi, the only two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the motion of confidence, but Banda's lengthy speech dominated it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in [[Dar es Salaam]]. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him to remain in the cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as the first day of the debate had gone in Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a back-bencher, sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 433\u20135.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 82, 85.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 162\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe end of the debate was something of an anti-climax, with Banda proclaiming that, \"This is not a cabinet crisis at all&nbsp;...\". However, as all members of parliament were required to speak, they had to declare for or against the motion of confidence. Few spoke in favour of the ex-ministers, even their family members. After the debate, Jones suggested that Banda should meet the ex-ministers. Banda was unwilling to meet them as long as they insisted on an all or nothing reinstatement, but he was willing to consider re-instating Chokani and Bwanausi, and possibly Chirwa, but not Chipembere or Chiume. Jones' efforts to enable the reinstatement some of the ministers between September 16 and 18 failed, as did his last-ditch attempt at compromise on September 26, when a meeting planned by Chipembere in Blantyre on that day and the next was banned, ostensibly because he had not obtained police permission.<ref>C Baker, (2000). Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa pp. 234, 237</ref> As clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and Banda began, any hope of reconciliation faded. Over the next few weeks a number of senior civil servants and associates of the former ministers left Malawi as the conflict spread.\n\nZomba became a centre of support for the ex-ministers and to counteract this on the night of 27/28 September, supporters of Banda from the Youth League of the MCP were bussed into Zomba and tried to close Zomba market and force those civil servants that were on strike back to work. However, the more numerous civil servants, armed themselves with sticks and attacked MCP supporters and burned down the party's national headquarters and a shop owned by the local MCP chairman. During these disturbances, one newly-appointed minister, [[Albert Muwalo]] was assaulted by the pro-Chipembere crowd, and another was severely beaten. By 30 September Muwalo and every other minister that supported Banda had left Zomba and supporters of the dismissed ministers remained in control of Zomba until troops and police moved in to restore calm a few days later.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 435, 437-9.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 103\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe ministers that had resigned or were dismissed had no coherent plans for resisting Banda and disagreed about what should happen when his powers were reduced. On the other hand, Banda had, in the six years since he had returned to the country, gained control of the MCP where his supporters controlled it in all three regions of Malawi and many districts, and had appointed many of its MPs. In addition, the security forces and police remained loyal, so Banda would have been difficult to dislodge if, as he did, he refused to relinquish power.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref>\n\n==The Causes of the Cabinet Crisis==\nChiume later drew attention to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating their opposition to the post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref> Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had been going on for some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 2\u20133.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 404, 433, 440.</ref> The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 211\u20132, 220.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 433\u20134, 439.</ref>\n\nIn a paper written by Chipembere (reprinted in Baker), Chipembere ascribes Banda starting to criticise ministers publicly from October 1963 to British administrative and intelligence officers who surrounded Dr. Banda and felt insecure in their jobs. These, said Chipembere, worked for the radicals' dismissal from the cabinet by creating suspicion and distrust in Dr. Banda's mind. He claimed to have found this out when visiting a neighbouring African country around this time, but did not give the source of this information.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 265\u20136.</ref> From February 1963, Banda received monthly reports from the police Special Branch, which he did not share with his cabinet colleagues. A number of these reports were critical of certain specific activities of Chipembere and Chiume.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 60, 68.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 179.</ref>\n\nAs Chipembere neither states the source of his information nor is specific about who the British officers surrounding Banda were, it is difficult to evaluate his claims. However, both he and Banda talk in terms of plots and misinformation. This may arise from the prevailing MCP intolerance of any perceived or imagined dissent. From 1956, Chipembere and Chiume promoted mass nationalism and led a major recruiting drive for the Nyasaland African Congress. Even in the early years, elements of a totalitarian ideology intolerant of any dissent started to appear. As Chipembere noted of himself in 1961, he had denounced the multi-party system as \"...&nbsp;a system of Government with a built-in subversive mechanism.\"<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 237\u201340.</ref>\n\nBetween his release in April 1960 and independence in July 1964, Banda and his followers made MCP into an absolutist body. As early as August 1958, Banda had claimed the right to make all MCP appointments and dismiss any member of the party. He also became its Life President and the centre of a personality cult fostered by Chiume as Publicity Secretary. Members of opposition parties were harassed and assaulted, trade unions were fiercely criticised and there was an attack on mission-based churches in the party newspaper. All were seen as rivals to MCP, even Jehovah's Witnesses, whose movement was detached from politics, and whose members declined to join MCP. All forms of political intolerance and violence increased before the 1963 pre-independence elections.<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 242\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn May 1964, Chiume looked forward to Malawi being organised with no opposition at all and claimed that there was nothing wrong with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by the people themselves was not a dictatorship. By the time that many of the ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long-term members.<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 245, 248-9.</ref>\n\n==After the Crisis and Chipembere's Revolt==\n\n===The ministers leave===\nIn October 1964, Chokani and Bwanausi, who had refused to rejoin the cabinet without their colleagues, left voluntarily for Zambia following Banda's refusal to negotiate. Chiume and Chisiza, who had gone to the north of Malawi in September, both crossed into Tanzania (as Tanganyika had become) on 1 October because they feared for their safety. Chirwa met Banda in the hope of serving as a judge but was beaten up by Banda's guards, and went into hiding before leaving secretly for Tanzania on 22 October. Chipembere had remained at his home in [[Mangochi District|Fort Johnston District]], avoiding any contact with Banda or Jones, under the protection of numerous local supporters. On 25 October, Banda claimed at an MPC meeting that the ex-ministers were plotting to overthrow him by force. Chipembere left his house on 28 October to go into hiding, following which Banda ordered his arrest, \"...&nbsp;alive if possible, but if not alive then any other way.\"<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 439\u201340.</ref> After Cameron had resigned in July 1964, he was advised to leave the country in November 1964, and returned to Scotland.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 355.</ref>\n\nThe British government thought an outcome to the crisis in which Banda shed some of his powers to the ministers but remained in charge would be ideal but, failing that, it was prepared to back him against his ministers. There was the fear that Chipembere and Chiume would align Malawi too closely with China, whereas Banda would be more favourable to British interests. Glyn Jones, as Governor-general was in a difficult position as he could only advise and had no executive power. In September 1964 his frequent meeting with Banda and the ministers, except for Chiume (who refused to meet him), both before and after they left office, were aimed at an accommodation between Banda and at least some of the ministers. His constitutional duty was however to support Banda once he had won the vote of confidence. Chipembere later claimed that expatriate civil servants and security officers had turned Banda against him and his colleagues. While there is little doubt that many expatriates preferred Banda to Chipembere and Chiume, there is no real evidence that they caused this estrangement.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref>\n\n===Armed conflict===\nAlthough there was widespread dissatisfaction in the north of Malawi, there was no major uprising there after the Cabinet Crisis. There was concern that Chiume and Chisiza would mount an invasion from Tanzania, but the armed uprising was in the south. After Chipembere went into hiding in the east of Fort Johnston District, he gathered a group of supports including politicians, civil servants and young activists which controlled much of the district. He set up a training camp and on the night of 12 February 1965 led about 200 supporters into Fort Johnston to attack the police station. They then attempted to reach the capital, Zomba, around 100 miles away. Chipembere's exact intentions are unknown, but he may have hoped that the army based in Zomba would come out in support of the rising. His small force was stopped at the [[Liwonde]] ferry by security forces and, after some fighting, it fled in disorder.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 440\u20135.</ref>\n\nAlthough there was a reward for his capture, Chipembere was able to remain in the Fort Johnston District until March when, ill with diabetes, he wrote to Jones, the Governor-general offering to leave Malawi in return for an amnesty. Banda at first rejected this, but after Chipembere contacted the US ambassador in early April, it was arranged (with Banda's consent) that he should leave Malawi and travel, through Southern Rhodesia and London, to the USA. He agreed not to plot against Banda there. Chipembere later claimed that an amnesty had been promised for his followers, but many of them were detained and a few continued raids on government targets for some time, leading to retaliatory burning of local villages and the public hanging of one of the leaders in January 1966. Many of Chipembere supporters were [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] and Banda promoted the recruitment of members of the rival [[Lomwe language|Lomwe]] group as paramilitary police to contain them.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 449.</ref> During and after the suppression of Chipembere's armed uprising, several hundred civil servants were sacked, or detained along with other of his supposed supporters, and chiefs suspected of sympathising with him were deposed.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 321.</ref>\n\nThere had been a minor incursion from Tanzania in March 1965 by fighters loyal to Yatuta Chisiza, when two of his fighters were killed. In September 1967, Chisiza himself led a force of less than 20 that had trained in Zambia through Mozambique into the [[Mwanza District]]. They were spotted by police on 3 October and nine were captured over the next few days. Chisiza himself was killed in a shoot-out with troops on 11 October and his corpse was publicly displayed on Banda's orders.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 445.</ref>\n\n==The Fates of the Ministers==\nSeveral of the ministers that fled from Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis died abroad, but a number survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and returned to public life. Several of those that had supported Banda at the time of the cabinet crisis later suffered demotion, dismissal or imprisonment at his hands. One of the new ministers appointed after the Cabinet Crisis in 1964, [[Albert Muwalo]], was hanged for treason in 1976.<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi.</ref>\n\nChipembere first studied at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), then taught in Tanzania from 1966 to 1969, before returning to UCLA to complete his doctorate and receive treatment for diabetes. He later taught at the [[California State University]]. Between 1970 and 1975, he worked on his autobiography, which was incomplete on his death. He died on 24 September 1975 from complications of his diabetes without returning to Malawi. After Banda was removed in 1993, Chipembere's reputation was rehabilitated.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, Chipembere obituary, Harvard Magazine May\u2013June 2010. http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/05/vita-masauko-chipembere</ref>\n\nChiume was in exile in Tanzania from 1964 to 1994, where he became active in journalism and set up a political movement aimed at promoting change in Malawi. He returned to Malawi in 1994 after Banda's removal and became chairman of the Malawi National Library Service until he retired in 1996. He then lived in his home district of Nkhata Bay until 2002, when he moved to New York because of his health, and died there on 21 November 2007.<ref>Chiume biography http://www.kanyamachiume.com/about.html</ref>\n\n[[Orton Chirwa]] settled in Tanzania, where he taught and practised law. On Christmas Eve 1981, Chirwa, his wife, Vera and their son were abducted from Zambia by Malawian security officials, possibly after being tricked into going to the border area. Two years later Orton and [[Vera Chirwa]] were put on trial for treason in a [[Traditional Courts in Malawi|\"traditional\" court]] and not allowed defence counsel. They were found guilty and sentenced to death, but after many appeals for clemency this was commuted to life in prison. Orton Chirwa died in Zomba prison on 20 October 1992, after nearly 11 years in solitary confinement. When he died, he was virtually deaf and blind.<ref>Chirwa obituary, Independent 22 October 1992, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-orton-chirwa-1558842.html</ref>\n\n[[Willie Chokani]] and [[Augustine Bwanausi]] left for Zambia in October 1964, where they became schoolteachers. Chokani became a headmaster of a secondary school and a college lecturer before moving to Tanzania where he was active in Malawian exile politics. He returned to Malawi in 1993 and was Malawi's Ambassador to the US from 1994 to 1999, then Ambassador to Ethiopia and High Commissioner to Namibia before his retirement. Bwanausi remained as a teacher in Zambia until his death in a car accident in 1973.<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi.</ref>\n \nAfter her dismissal as parliamentary secretary and from the Women's League, Rose Chibambo resigned as an MP and joined her husband who was in the district administration of [[Chiradzulu]] and later [[Mwanza]], but after threats from MCP members, they both fled to Zambia in early 1965. Her husband died in Zambia in 1968, but she survived to return to Malawi in 1994.<ref>J Power, (2010). Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi, p. 187.</ref> Msonthi took over Chipembere's former post as Minister for Education, and served in several cabinet posts until his removal on charges of breaching MCP party discipline in 1973. He was internally exiled to his home district for five years, before partial rehabilitation and being given a post in a government parastatal, which he held until his death in 1982.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 179.</ref>\n\nAleke Banda, who had become Secretary-General of MCP in 1962, became a cabinet minister in 1962, and served in three cabinet posts before being dismissed by Banda in 1973. In 1975, he was appointed managing director of Press Holdings Ltd, a company controlled by Banda but in 1979 was detained without charge for 12 years. After Banda's removal, he re-entered politics in opposition to MCP, and between 1997 and 2005 held two cabinet posts. He retired through illness in 2005 and died from leukaemia in 2010. John Tembo ceased to be a cabinet minister in 1971, becoming Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi but retaining his MCP position. In 1982, Tembo left the Reserve Bank and, although he held no ministerial office until 1989, he was a close advisor to Banda and held a number of posts in parastatal bodies. In 1989, he became MCP treasurer and again held ministerial office. In 1995 he was accused, along with Banda of murder, but acquitted. After 1994, Tembo remained with MCP and in politics, and is currently Malawi's [[Leader of the Opposition]].<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012).

These dismissals were followed by the resignations of three more cabinet ministers and another parliamentary secretary, in sympathy with those dismissed. Initially, this only left the President and one other minister in post, although one of those who had resigned rescinded his resignation within a few hours. The reasons that the ex-ministers put forward for the confrontation and subsequent resignations were the autocratic attitude of Banda, who failed to consult other ministers and kept power in his own hands, his insistence on maintaining diplomatic relations with South Africa and Portugal and a number of domestic austerity measures. It is unclear whether the former ministers intended to remove Banda entirely, to reduce his role to that of a non-executive figurehead or simply to force him to recognise collective cabinet responsibility. Banda seized the initiative, firstly, by dismissing some of the dissidents rather than negotiating, and secondly, (after the resignations) by holding a [[debate]] on a [[Motion of no confidence|motion of confidence]] on 8 and 9 September 1964. As the result of the debate was an overwhelming vote of confidence, Banda declined to reinstate any of the ministers or offer them any other posts, despite the urging of the [[Governor-General]] to compromise. After some unrest, and clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and of Banda, most of the former left Malawi in October with their families and leading supporters, for [[Zambia]] or [[Tanzania]]. One ex-minister, [[Henry Masauko Blasius Chipembere|Henry Chipembere]] went into hiding inside Malawi and, in February 1965 led a small, unsuccessful armed uprising. After its failure, he was able to arrange for his transfer to the USA. Another ex-minister, [[Yatuta Chisiza]], organised an even smaller incursion from Mozambique in 1967, in which he was killed. Several of the former ministers died in exile or, in the case of [[Orton Chirwa]] in a Malawian jail, but some survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and to return to public life.\n\nThe Cabinet Crisis, sometimes referred to as the '''Revolt of the Ministers''' is one of the most important but also most controversial episodes in the history of independent Malawi. Many of the contemporary documentary sources were written by expatriate diplomats and officials who were not close to the ex-ministers, and in some cases antipathetic to them. These accounts have been contradicted by the autobiographies, often written long after the event, of the ex-ministers themselves, although these are also inconsistent with one another. The principal published works quoted rely on a mixture of documentary sources and interviews with participants, both African and expatriate, and suggest that the crisis arose in a political culture that permitted no dissent, and treated attempts to debate issues as plotting.\n\n==Nyasaland African Congress==\n\n===Development of Congress===\nFor most of the colonial period, most Africans in [[Nyasaland]] had no political voice and only a small number of [[Tribal chief|chiefs]] had a very limited influence on the colonial government and they did not represent the interests of a growing body of African town dwellers. Most early African interest groups were local, represented only a small, mainly urban educated African elite and promoted their demands for a political voice, not independence. Only in the 1940s, with the formation of the [[Nyasaland African Congress]], did one organisation represent the whole of Nyasaland. <ref>van Velson (1966), Some Early Pressure Groups in Malawi, pp. 376-8, 400, 411.</ref> From 1944, various African local associations united into the [[Nyasaland African Congress]], which demanded African representation on the [[Legislative Council]] that advised the colonial governors.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 271, 313\u201316.</ref> From 1946, the Nyasaland African Congress received financial and political support from Hastings Banda, then living in Britain. Post-war British governments of both main parties agreed to the formation of a federation of the three British territories in Central Africa, rather than their complete amalgamation, as the Southern Rhodesian government preferred: the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] was pushed through in 1953 against very strong African opposition.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 62, 65\u20136.</ref> Federation radicalised some younger Congress members, and when in 1955 the [[Colonial Office]] agreed that the Legislative Council should include five African members nominated by Provincial Councils, they seized the opportunity. Although the Provincial Councils were largely composed of chiefs, their members were receptive to popular wishes, and they nominated Congress members or supporters to the Legislative Council. In 1956, Henry Chipembere and [[Kanyama Chiume]], two young radical members of Congress, were nominated together with two moderate Congress members and a Congress supporter. This success led to a rapid growth in Congress membership in 1956 and 1957.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 341\u20132.</ref>\n\nChipembere and Chiume were members of a new generation of pan-Africanist politicians, deeply influenced by Socialist and sometimes Marxist ideas and experiences acquired outside Malawi, who realised the value of a well-organised mass movement. Chipembere was a southerner, but many others were northerners. Chiume was born in the [[Nkhata Bay]] district but educated entirely in Tanganyika and Uganda. [[Dunduzu Chisiza]] and his elder brother, [[Yatuta Chisiza]], had been born in [[Karonga District]] before becoming a long-term residents of Uganda and Tanganyika. They were influenced both by [[Julius Nyerere]] and [[Kenneth Kaunda]]; Dunduzu  had also lived in Southern Rhodesia before being deported to Nyasaland for his political activities.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, p. 76.</ref> During the 1950s, these younger men displaced the older generation as leaders of Congress. They expressed hostility towards Europeanization, which cut them off from their cultural roots, an African middle class sympathising with Federation and the autocratic Chiefs. However, as they lacked status and knowledge of local African customs, they needed a charismatic older man as their leader. The chosen leader, Dr Banda, was sensitive to the country's political tradition. In preaching defiance of the \"stupid Federation\", Banda was in tune with the popular mood, but he also defended the chiefs and the rights of the older generation of educated men.<ref>M L Chanock, (1975). Ambiguities in the Malawian Political Tradition, p. 344.</ref>\n\n===Banda's return===\nThe younger members of the Nyasaland African Congress had little faith in its leader, [[Thamar Dillon Thomas Banda|T D T Banda]], and wished to replace him with Dr Hastings Banda, who had by then moved to the [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]]. Dr Banda announced he would only return if given the presidency of Congress: after this was agreed, he returned to Nyasaland in July 1958 and T D T Banda was ousted.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 344\u20135.</ref>\n\nWhen Banda returned to Nyasaland, which he had left in 1915, he was over 60. Chipembere and Chiume and most other leading Congress activists were in their late 20s or early 30s. As well as the age difference there was, from the start, a disagreement about Banda's role: the activists saw him as a figurehead, but he saw himself as the leader of Congress and expected their obedience.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 2\u20133.</ref> Banda was absolutely opposed to Federation, but otherwise more moderate in his speeches that the younger Congress members. Both Chipembere and Chiume avoided social contact with Europeans and, in their speeches, they frequently denounced Europeans as a group, in contrast to Banda's relatively cordial relations with individual Europeans.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 207.</ref>\n\nBanda appointed Chipembere as Treasurer, Chiume as Publicity Secretary and [[Dunduzu Chisiza]] as Secretary-general of Congress.  He also appointed four other young radicals to the party's Executive Committee, ignoring older moderates, but made it clear that he regarded his appointees as subordinates, not colleagues. Although these appointees had senior positions, these came with a heavy workload and tied them to the MCP headquarters in [[Blantyre]], away from their grassroots support.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 6\u20137.</ref> In the nine months between his return and the declaration of a State of Emergency, Banda combined opposition to Federation with more popular causes, such as the African smallholders' dislike of agricultural practices imposed on them. He used these popular issues to mobilise Congress supporters into strikes, disobedience and protests that would disrupt the everyday operation of the colonial government.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 347\u201349.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 155.</ref>\n\n==The 1959 Emergency==\n\n===Background===\nIn January 1958, Banda presented Congress proposals for an African majority in the Legislative Council to the governor, Sir [[Robert Perceval Armitage|Robert Armitage]]. As this would have led to a demand for withdrawal from the Federation, Armitage refused. This breakdown in talks led to Congress demands for more violent anti-government action, and leading Congress activists made increasingly inflammatory statements. Armitage was influenced by reports from police informers, who claimed Congress planned the indiscriminate killing of Europeans and Asians, and of its African opponents, the so-called \"murder plot\". There is no evidence that a murder plot existed, but the refusal of Banda or other Congress leaders to condemn the violent actions of Congress members gave it some plausibility. Armitage prepared for mass arrests and, on 20 February, troops from Rhodesia were flown into Nyasaland. In the days following 20 February, both Chipembere and Yatuta Chisiza  made a number of provocative speeches, many followed by disturbances,  and the police or troops fired on some of these, leading to four deaths.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 296\u20137.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 296, 349\u201351.</ref>\n\nOn 3 March 1959 Armitage declared a [[State of emergency|State of Emergency]] over the whole of the protectorate and arrested Banda, other members of the Congress executive committee and over a hundred local party officials. The Nyasaland African Congress was banned the next day. Those arrested were detained without trial and the total number detained finally rose to over 1,300. Rather than calming the situation immediately, in the emergency that followed fifty-one Africans were killed and many more were wounded.<ref>C Baker, (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, p. 28.</ref> By the night of 3 March, most principal Congress leaders had been arrested and detained. Some were released very quickly, but 72 prominent detainees, including Banda, were flown to Southern Rhodesia. Others were detained in Nyasaland. In the immediate aftermath of arrest, 21 people were killed and many wounded.<ref>C Baker, (1997). State of Emergency: Nyasaland 1959, pp. 40\u20132, 48.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWithin two days of the declaration of the state of emergency, the British [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] under [[Harold Macmillan]] decided to set up a Commission of Inquiry into the disturbances. Macmillan did not choose its chairman, Devlin, and later criticised his appointment on the basis of his Irish ancestry and Catholic upbringing. Macmillan not only broadly rejected the Devlin Report, which had taken several months to prepare, but engineered the production of the rival [[Armitage Report]], which was prepared very quickly so it could be released on the same day as the Devlin Report.<ref>A Horne, (2008) Macmillan: The Official Biography, pp. 180\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe [[Devlin Commission]] concentrated on three areas: the State of Emergency, the murder plot and African opposition to Federation. It found that the declaration of a State of Emergency was necessary to restore order and prevent a descent into anarchy, but it criticised instances of the illegal use of force by the police and troops. It also found that the Nyasaland government's suppression of criticism and of support for Congress justified calling it a \"police state\". Its strongest criticism was over the \"murder plot\", which it said not exist, and the use made of it by both the Nyasaland and British governments in trying to justify the Emergency, which it condemned. It also declared that Banda had no knowledge of the inflammatory talk of some Congress activists about attacking Europeans. Finally, it noted the almost universal rejection of Federation by Nyasaland's African people and suggested the British government should negotiate with African leaders on the country's constitutional future.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 356, 359.</ref><ref>C Baker (2007). The Mechanics of Rebuttal, pp. 40\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe Nyasaland government had imprisoned Banda, not realising that he was the only African politician they could negotiate with on a credible constitution for the protectorate. At first, the British government tried to calm the situation by nominating additional African members (who were not Congress supporters) to the Legislative Council.  However, it soon decided that the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland could not be maintained and that Nyasaland and [[Northern Rhodesia]] should be given responsible government under majority rule. Devlin's conclusion that there was no murder plot and that Banda was not involved in promoting violence opened the way for the British government to deal with him. Banda was released in April 1960 and invited to London to discuss proposals for responsible government.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 287\u201394, 296\u20139, 309\u201313.</ref>\n\nChipembere, Dunduzu Chisiza and his brother Yatuta were arrested in the State of Emergency and imprisoned with Banda for 13 months in [[Gweru|Gwelo]] in Southern Rhodesia, but Chiume, who was in London, escaped arrest. This did little to bring Banda and the others together: Banda became concerned with Chipembere's volatile temper, and Banda's increasingly authoritarian attitudes alarmed his three fellow prisoners. Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers remained in detention, first in Rhodesia and later in Nyasaland, after Banda was released. [[Iain Macleod]], the Colonial Secretary was at first suspicious of Banda, and regarded the three others as extremists. He eventually agreed to Banda's request for their release, but they were among the last to be released in September 1960.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 377.</ref> This was after Banda had returned from constitutional talks in London, where he had been accompanied by Orton Chirwa, a lawyer and [[Aleke Banda]], a young activist. In May 1960, Chiume returned to Nyasaland and his attempts to ingratiate himself with Banda led to his estrangement from Chipembere and the Chisiza brothers. After his release, Chipembere embarked on a series of fiery speeches: the colonial authorities considered these were sufficiently threatening to warrant his arrest, and he was again imprisoned, receiving a three-year sentence  in January 1961. Chiume escaped prosecution for his speeches, as he was considered of lower importance. Chipembere was still in prison in August 1961, when Banda (who had insisted on selecting all his party's candidates) won an overwhelming electoral victory. The new Governor, [[Glyn Smallwood Jones]] was willing to discuss Chipembere's early release but despite Dunduzu Chisiza's urging, Banda allowed Chipembere to serve much of his sentence until his release in January 1963. In August 1961, Chipembere's father had been elected to the Legislative Council in place of his son, but gave up his seat on Chipembere's release.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 9, 14, 27.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 209\u201311.</ref>\n\n==The Malawi Congress Party==\n\n===Formation===\nChirwa and Aleke Banda had only been detained for a short time and in 1959 they had formed the [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP) to replace the banned Nyasaland African Congress, making it clear that they were acting on behalf of the imprisoned Banda. The reconstitution of Congress as the Malawi Congress Party from September 1959 marked a major shift in its character. The Nyasaland African Congress was an anti-colonial liberation movement but after the 1961 elections, the MCP was in government. There was a regional shift in support for the MCP: in both the Southern and Central Provinces, people flocked to join the party but, in the north, branches were formed only in a limited number of places. The MCP quickly emerged as a larger party, distinctly more authoritarian in its approach, than Congress had been. It became a mass party, but Chipembere and the Chisizas were unknown to many of the new members, who regarded Banda as the sole leader.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 76, 80-1.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p. 198.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Nyasaland general election, 1961|1961 elections]], MPC won 22 out of the 28 available Legislative Council seats, including all the \"lower roll\" seats, which had a predominantly African electorate. The largest group of MPC Legislative Council members was formed of eight who had received at least secondary education, mainly former students; five of the six early ministerial appointments fell to this group. They were generally under 35 (only Chirwa was over 40), and a disproportionate number of these came from the [[Northern Region, Malawi|Northern Region]], because several mission schools there taught to a high standard. The next group was of local MCP bosses who were generally a decade older than the first group. They were generally less well educated but had stronger local ties, and after the 1964 crisis, several of them replaced the former ministers of the first group. At first, MPC backbench members raised questions on sensitive issues and questioned ministers with relative freedom, but by late 1962, this had ceased and only the few non-MCP Legislative Council members were able to offer any criticism. Banda started to intervene in the speeches of ministers and to cut short debates, arguing that he alone made policy.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 381, 403-4.</ref>\n\nBefore the elections, the Colonial Office had assumed that MPC would be entitled to three Executive Council seats through winning a majority of the \"lower roll\" seats. As the Lancaster House agreement provided that two Executive Council seats would go to ministers elected by the \"upper roll\" of largely European and Asian electors, it was thought that the mainly white [[United Federal Party]] would gain both these seats: with five officials also sitting, there would be a non-MCP majority on the Executive Council. In the event, the United Federal Party only won five Legislative Council seats, two going to MPC and one to an MCP-inclined independent, [[Colin Cameron (Malawian politician)|Colin Cameron]]. The Governor offered the United Federal Party a single Executive Council seat, which it refused. This left all five elected seats for MCP candidates. In theory, Jones, the Governor, was entitled to allocate portfolios, but he allowed Banda to make nominations. Banda decided to take two for himself, becoming both Minister of Natural Resources and Minister of Local Government. Chiume became Minister of Education and [[Augustine Bwanausi]] became Minister of Labour. The two upper roll ministers were Colin Cameron (Minister of Works) and <ref> Mikeka Mkandawire as Minister without Portfolio</ref>. Two MCP parliamentary secretaries were also appointed, but did not sit in the Executive Council. These were Dunduzu Chisiza in the Ministry of Finance and Orton Chirwa in the Ministry of Justice. Two additional appointments were made in March 1962, of [[John Msonthi]] and [[Willie Chokani]], and Chirwa became the Minister of Justice and [[Attorney-general]] at the start of 1964.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 381\u20132.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 45.</ref>\n\n===In government===\nWhen Banda and four other MCP ministers joined five officials on the Executive Council, they formed a [[Responsible government]] accountable to the Governor. A timetable for full self-government independence was agreed at a constitutional conference in London in 1962 and the Jones allowed Banda and the MPC ministers and parliamentary secretaries, now seven in total, to initiate policies. Nyasaland achieved internal self-government with Banda as Prime Minister in February 1963. Full independence was gained (and the country's name became Malawi) on 6 July 1964, with Banda as Prime Minister. Malawi became a republic within the Commonwealth, on 6 July 1966, when Banda became its first President.<ref>J G Pike, (1969). Malawi: A Political and Economic History, pp. 159, 170.</ref><ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, p. 313.</ref>\n\nIn February 1963, Banda, as Prime Minister, was able to select a cabinet of 10 members to replace the Executive Council. This included the temporary appointment of [[Sir Henry Phillips|Henry Phillips]] the former Financial Secretary as Minister of Finance, the post Dunduzu Chisiza would have taken but for his death in 1962. Other official members left office. Chipembere joined the cabinet as Minister of Local Government, and Chiume added Social Development to his Education post. There were some changes of portfolios: Willie Chokani took over as Minister of Labour, replacing Augustine Bwanausi, who became Minister of the Interior, and [[John Tembo]] was made a parliamentary secretary, with the intention of his replacing Phillips, who retired in early 1964. The Governor suggested that Bwanausi had more experience and would be a better choice as Minister of Finance, but Banda was insistent on Tembo. Msonthi and Cameron retained their existing posts and Mkandawire left the cabinet by his own choice. At this time, Aleke Banda, a close aide to Banda, was made MCP secretary-general.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 80\u20131, 91-2, 95-6, 333.</ref>\n\nGenerally, the MCP ministers were very active in their new roles and, although there was some friction with permanent officials, they were effective <ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 388.</ref> Banda, as Minister of Natural Resources (which included farming), introduced three crucial reforms, the abolition of punitive element of conservation practices (although not the conservation measures themselves), the final abolition of [[thangata]] through the Africans on Private Estates Act in 1962, and the reform of the marketing of peasant crops.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 390\u20132.</ref> Chiume, the Minister of Education, promoted the expansion of secondary education, the creation of a teacher training college and a polytechnic and sending Malawian students to overseas universities, pending the creation of a university in Malawi. The last led to accusations of favouring fellow-northerners when granting scholarships. Chiume, an abrasive personality, more controversially attacked the hold of the missions on education and insisted on bringing them under greater state control.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 400\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Banda's leadership===\nSoon after the Lancaster House constitutional conference in 1962, Banda made it clear in the Legislative Council that he alone was responsible for making policy, which the ministers were to execute without debate or dissent. No criticism of Banda was permitted, but Banda allowed ministers to criticise each other and did not counter claims that the significant number of ministers from the north were favouring fellow northerners. Chiume in particular was involved in disputes with Cameron, the Minister of Works and Dunduzu Chisiza the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance.  In August 1962, both Cameron and Chisiza offered their resignations to the Governor but were persuaded to remain in post; Chisiza died shortly afterwards. Banda was accused of building-up an entourage based on his own [[Chewa language|Chewa]] group, but before the 1963 election, he held the balance between competing MCP factions.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 403, 406-7.</ref>\n\nDunduzu Chisiza had died in September 1962, apparently in a car crash, although many people in Malawi continue to believe he was murdered on Banda's instructions. Although the balance of probabilities is that Chisiza's death was accidental, it is clear that before his death, he saw the possibility of a dictatorship as a major threat. His preference was for a strong central government uniting all sectional interests and allowing dissenting views to be expressed. In a pamphlet written shortly before his death, he argued that, whereas it was necessary for the strong leadership of one individual and acceptance of his decisions during an independence struggle, once independence had been achieved, the former subordinates should cease to be submissive. He considered that a leader surrounded only by willing subordinates would soon become dictatorial; a prescient claim in view of Banda's later actions. Chisiza agreed with Banda on many issues, however on others he dissented more, and more publicly, than any other minister.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 410\u20132.</ref>\n\n==Independence==\nUntil Banda was sworn in as Prime Minister on 1 February 1963, the Governor retained the ultimate responsibility for law and order. Immediately after this, despite some attacks by MCP militants on [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and members of opposition parties, the situation was generally calm until the [[Nyasaland general election, 1964|pre-independence election]] campaign began in late 1963. By January 1964, almost every opposition leader had fled the country and over 1,800 attacks on political opponents of the MPC and Jehovah's Witnesses were recorded in January and February 1964. This violence was orchestrated by local MCP bosses, but Banda did little to stop it,<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 418\u201320.</ref>\n\nIn July 1963, Banda took over Msonthi's portfolio of Transport and Communication and removed him from the cabinet without giving any reason, although Chipembere later stated it was probable that Msonthi was suspected of corruption, and others mentioned his drinking. At the time, other ministers suspected that Banda had removed Msonthi to test their reaction to an arbitrary sacking. Banda also claimed in cabinet that he had considered dismissing other (unnamed) ministers, and the whole affair increased ministerial insecurity. Msonthi was reappointed to the cabinet in August 1963, and soon after the three MCP regional chairmen were given ministerial status, diluting the influence of existing ministers.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965, pp. 91\u20132, 95-6, 333.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 430.</ref>\n\nDifferences between Banda and the ministers arose for several reasons. Firstly, Banda insisted on making all the important decisions relating to the state and the MCP, including nominating all the candidates for election, and he refused to devolve real responsibility to them. Within the MCP, Banda set up a new committee to strengthen and centralise party discipline, reducing local control. He also became life president of the MCP in February 1963. After the 1963 election, Banda began to make slighting references to the ministers in speeches.  Earlier, his criticism had been in private, but on 27 October 1963, he berated them in a long public speech. More privately, he accused Chipembere, Chiume and Bwanausi of forming a cabal against him. In November 1963, he took over Chiume's ministerial responsibilities for Education and Social Development without removing him from the cabinet, where he was given responsibility for the transition to independence. Chipembere then became Minister of Education. Banda later claimed this was done to drive a wedge between Chipembere and Chiume. In a further cabinet reshuffle, Yatutza Chisiza took on Home Affairs and Bwanausi moved to Development and Transport. Banda himself retained the Trade and Industry, Health, Natural Resources and Social Development portfolios as well as being Prime Minister. His holding so many posts and devolving the day-to-day work to parliamentary secretaries was criticised, as was the frequency with which he shifted ministers around. Banda's appointment of his followers to statutory bodies also appeared to diminish the power and influence of existing ministers.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 80\u20131.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965, pp. 91\u20132, 95-6, 333.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 403\u20134.</ref>\n\nSecondly, Banda continued diplomatic relations with [[South Africa]] and [[Portugal]], but refused to recognise the People's Republic of [[China]] or [[East Germany]], despite most ministers' ideological concerns, and contemptuously rejected attempts by Chiume and Yatuta Chisiza to form closer ties with Zambia and [[Tanzania|Tanganyika]]. Thirdly, the slow pace of [[Africanization]] in the Civil Service, the freezing of Civil Service salaries and the introduction of a charge for outpatients at state hospitals were not seen as passing the benefits of independence to the people.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317\u20138.</ref>\n\n==The Cabinet Crisis==\n\n===Initial disagreements===\nSince the Cabinet Crisis of 1964, there has been disagreement on the extent to which rivalries within the MCP in the early 1960s reflected generational and ideological tensions between Dr Banda and his younger ministers or regional divisions. Following the release of the Chisiza brothers and Chipembere in October 1960, the influence of northerners appeared to grow, reaching a peak in September 1961 when Yatuta Chisiza was appointed the party's Administrative Secretary alongside his brother, Dunduzu, the Secretary General; Chiume was Publicity Secretary; Orton Chirwa was Legal Adviser; and Rose Chibambo, the only woman on the party's National Executive, was Chairman of the Woman's League. This apparent northern dominance, masked divisions and politicians born in the north pursued various personal and ideological agendas and did not act as a regional bloc. After the Lancaster House conference made it clear that independence would be achieved, MCP became a more divided party. The focus moved away from achieving independence towards the allocation of resources between ministries and regions. Resentment of the hold that better-educated northerners had on scarce jobs was used by Banda to assert his authority by playing ministers off against one another, but there is no evidence of him adopting a pro-[[Chewa people|Chewa]], anti-northern stance before the 1964 crisis. None of the ministers who resigning in 1964 drew attention to regional distinctions, but Banda's allies from the [[Central Region, Malawi|Central Region]] accused northern politician in general and Chiume in particular of favouritism, and voiced Chewa resentment against senior civil servants from the north, many of whom had demonstrated in favour of the former ministers. Rose Chibambo came in for particularly violent abuse, probably because of anti-female as well as anti-northern prejudice.<ref>J McCracken, (2002). The Ambiguities of Nationalism, pp. 80\u20131, 83-4.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 404\u20135, 435-6.</ref>\n\nColin Cameron, the only European minister remaining at independence on 6 July 1964, stated that, at that time, all the African ministers apart from Chiume had decided to press for rapid [[Africanization]] and links with other African states, and to end Banda's dictatorial behaviour. On his return from a visit to Cairo on 26 July, Banda made a public speech threatening ministers; this had the perverse effect of uniting them all, including Chiume. Banda's proposal to reintroduce detention without trial at the cabinet meeting of 29 July 1964 united all the ministers against him, but only Colin Cameron resigned. Chipembere later explained that the other ministers did not resign as detention was a popular issue they could not oppose, but they hoped it would be used sparingly.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 72.</ref> On 10 August, the ministers attending (Tembo was not present, and Chiume was probably also absent) asked Banda to stop making slighting references to them in speeches and not to hold so many government portfolios himself. Chipembere later recorded that Banda gave them a hearing, but was concerned that they were \"ganging up\" against him, and was reluctant to meet them as a group. However, Banda appeared to accept their concerns and apologised about the hurtful remarks he had made about them.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 72\u20133.</ref>\n\n===The ministers complain===\nAt the cabinet meeting of 26 August 1964, all the ministers present (including to some degree John Tembo) raised their concerns about Banda's failure to Africanise, his relations with Portugal and South Africa and their own ambiguous position. The ministers present presented Banda with a list of grievances: he made no immediate answer, neither accepting or rejecting what the list contained.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 431, 451.</ref><ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 317\u20138.</ref> Banda was apparently surprised by the strength of the opposition at this cabinet meeting, even though his recent relations with Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza had been difficult. A number of ministers led by Chisiza apparently wished to convert Banda's role from that of Prime Minister, with an expected progression to become executive President, to be in the future a President without executive functions, with an appointed Prime Minister as head of government. Chiume had been a prominent supporter of Banda and, since 1959, had not been close to the more radical group. However, once Banda had strongly rejected his plan to accept aid from China, Chiume began to attack him, and precipitated the confrontation of 26 August 1964.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 159\u201360.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, p 212.</ref>\n\nThe ministers thought that their united stand had been successful. They did not know that Banda had already decided not to agree to their demands, but wanted to test how strong his support was by consulting MCP leaders before taking action. He also had Special Branch reports on the ministers, to assess their likely reaction to the dismissal of some of their colleagues. On 31 August, Banda told his expatriate cabinet secretary that he intended to have no further discussions with the ministers. He intended to resign as Prime Minister, but only because it would automatically end the tenure of the other ministers: on reappointment he would form a new cabinet without Chipembere, Chiume and Chisiza, but with the addition of four new ministers loyal to him. On 1 September, he advised the Governor-general of his intention not to reappoint Chiume or Chisiza: he said Chipembere and Msonthi might also be dropped.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 77.</ref>\n\nAt a further meeting with the ministers, excluding Chipembere who was in Canada, on 2 September 1964, Banda made no concessions to the ministers, and the meeting ended in chaos, with Banda ordering them out of the cabinet room. The ministers then met and proposed that Banda should be forced to resign, with Chirwa becoming Prime minister and Chipembere left out of the cabinet. After the abortive cabinet meeting, Banda contacted the Governor-general, who advised him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament rather than resign. His success there in the Malawi parliament in 1964 was a foregone conclusion, as it had no opposition party members and as all the MCP members were personally nominated by Banda.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Chipembere, the Missing Years, p. 78.</ref>\n\n===The confidence vote===\nOn 7 September at an informal meeting, Banda appealed to Members of Parliament to support him in a vote of confidence to be held after a debate on 8 and 9 September. Also on 7 September, Banda called upon Glyn Jones, as Governor-general to issue dismissal letters to Chirwa, Chiume, and Bwanausi, who all accepted their dismissals with dignity. [[Rose Chibambo]], a parliamentary secretary, was also dismissed. The other cabinet members, except for John Tembo, showed solidarity with their colleagues. On the same day, Yatuta Chisiza, Chokani and, after some hesitation, Msonthi handed their resignations to the Governor-general. Chokani later claimed that Jones urged him not to resign and, after taking advice, Msonthi withdrew his resignation a few hours later: Banda immediately accepted this. Jones then suggested a meeting between the other resigning ministers and Banda, but Chisiza and Chokani declined. It is not clear whether, having dismissed Chiume, Chirwa and Bwanausi, Banda expected Chipembere and Yatutu Chisiza to continue in office, but they resigned.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 162\u20133.</ref><ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 220\u20131.</ref> None of the ministers who were dismissed or who had resigned made any significant effort to mobilise support from other Members of Parliament, most of whom owed their nominations to Banda, although they had significant support from African civil servants.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 431\u20133.</ref>\n\nTembo and Msonthi, the only two cabinet ministers left, opened the debate by proposing the motion of confidence, but Banda's lengthy speech dominated it. In this, he claimed that the ministers had conspired against him, because he had preventing them abusing their positions and because they were being controlled by China's ambassador in [[Dar es Salaam]]. In response, only Chiume set out any detailed criticism of Banda, the others concentrated on stating their continued loyalty to him, despite being denounced as traitors. Chipembere returned from Canada on 8 September. Banda had written to him, asking him to remain in the cabinet, but this was before the debate, when Banda was uncertain of what support he had. Chipembere wished to effect a reconciliation between Banda and the ministers, and approached the Governor-General, asking him to request Banda to postpone the debate. However, as the first day of the debate had gone in Banda's favour, he decided against reconciliation and refused a postponement. Chipembere therefore resigned on the morning of 9 September and attended parliament as a back-bencher, sitting with the other ex-ministers. Chipembere's speech deplored the breakdown of party unity and that the ex-ministers had been reviled as traitors. He expressed his general support for their grievances, and although he expressed loyalty to Banda, he pointedly argued that cabinet responsibility should be collective and that there should be consultation on important issues.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 433\u20135.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 82, 85.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 162\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe end of the debate was something of an anti-climax, with Banda proclaiming that, \"This is not a cabinet crisis at all&nbsp;...\". However, as all members of parliament were required to speak, they had to declare for or against the motion of confidence. Few spoke in favour of the ex-ministers, even their family members. After the debate, Jones suggested that Banda should meet the ex-ministers. Banda was unwilling to meet them as long as they insisted on an all or nothing reinstatement, but he was willing to consider re-instating Chokani and Bwanausi, and possibly Chirwa, but not Chipembere or Chiume. Jones' efforts to enable the reinstatement some of the ministers between September 16 and 18 failed, as did his last-ditch attempt at compromise on September 26, when a meeting planned by Chipembere in Blantyre on that day and the next was banned, ostensibly because he had not obtained police permission<ref>C Baker, (2000). Sir Glyn Jones, A Proconsul in Africa pp. 234, 237</ref>. As clashes between supporters of the ex-ministers and Banda began, any hope of reconciliation faded. Over the next few weeks a number of senior civil servants and associates of the former ministers left Malawi as the conflict spread. \n\nZomba became a centre of support for the ex-ministers and to counteract this on the night of 27/28 September, supporters of Banda from the Youth League of the MCP were bussed into Zomba and tried to close Zomba market and force those civil servants that were on strike back to work. However, the more numerous civil servants, armed themselves with sticks and attacked MCP supporters and burned down the party's national headquarters and a shop owned by the local MCP chairman. During these disturbances, one newly-appointed minister, [[Albert Muwalo]] was assaulted by the pro-Chipembere crowd, and another was severely beaten. By 30 September Muwalo and every other minister that supported Banda had left Zomba and supporters of the dismissed ministers remained in control of Zomba until troops and police moved in to restore calm a few days later.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 435, 437-9.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 103\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe ministers that had resigned or were dismissed had no coherent plans for resisting Banda and disagreed about what should happen when his powers were reduced. On the other hand, Banda had, in the six years since he had returned to the country, gained control of the MCP where his supporters controlled it in all three regions of Malawi and many districts, and had appointed many of its MPs. In addition, the security forces and police remained loyal, so Banda would have been difficult to dislodge if, as he did, he refused to relinquish power.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref>\n\n==The Causes of the Cabinet Crisis==\nChiume later drew attention to long standing political differences between Banda and the younger generation of MCP leaders, some going back to Banda's return in 1959, although until shortly before the August 1964 crisis, Chiume publicly supported Banda enthusiastically. Chipembere rejected this claim, dating their opposition to the post- independence period when Banda's actions became intolerable to them.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref> Banda claimed in September and October 1964 that the ex-ministers, particularly Chiume and Chipembere, had been plotting to remove him from office and that these plots had been going on for some time. This is unlikely in view of the ministers' lack of agreed objectives and the unplanned nature of their response.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 pp. 2\u20133.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 404, 433, 440.</ref> The conversion of Chiume from loyalty to Banda bordering on sycophancy at odds with several of his cabinet colleagues to leading cabinet opposition to Banda took place extraordinarily quickly in August 1964, and his actions in leading the opposition to Banda was the nearest thing there was to any concerted plot. Both Chipembere in September and Chirwa in October tried to resolve to the crisis through compromise rather than plotting.<ref>A C Ross, (2009). Colonialism to Cabinet Crisis: a Political History of Malawi, pp. 211\u20132, 220.</ref><ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 433\u20134, 439.</ref>\n\nIn a paper written by Chipembere (reprinted in Baker), Chipembere ascribes Banda starting to criticise ministers publicly from October 1963 to British administrative and intelligence officers who surrounded Dr. Banda and felt insecure in their jobs. These, said Chipembere, worked for the radicals' dismissal from the cabinet by creating suspicion and distrust in Dr. Banda's mind. He claimed to have found this out when visiting a neighbouring African country around this time, but did not give the source of this information.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 265\u20136.</ref> From February 1963, Banda received monthly reports from the police Special Branch, which he did not share with his cabinet colleagues. A number of these reports were critical of certain specific activities of Chipembere and Chiume.<ref>C Baker, (2006). Chipembere, the Missing Years, pp. 60, 68.</ref><ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 179.</ref>\n\nAs Chipembere neither states the source of his information nor is specific about who the British officers surrounding Banda were, it is difficult to evaluate his claims. However, both he and Banda talk in terms of plots and misinformation. This may arise from the prevailing MCP intolerance of any perceived or imagined dissent. From 1956, Chipembere and Chiume promoted mass nationalism and led a major recruiting drive for the Nyasaland African Congress. Even in the early years, elements of a totalitarian ideology intolerant of any dissent started to appear. As Chipembere noted of himself in 1961, he had denounced the multi-party system as \"...&nbsp;a system of Government with a built-in subversive mechanism.\"<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 237\u201340.</ref>\n\nBetween his release in April 1960 and independence in July 1964, Banda and his followers made MCP into an absolutist body. As early as August 1958, Banda had claimed the right to make all MCP appointments and dismiss any member of the party. He also became its Life President and the centre of a personality cult fostered by Chiume as Publicity Secretary. Members of opposition parties were harassed and assaulted, trade unions were fiercely criticised and there was an attack on mission-based churches in the party newspaper. All were seen as rivals to MCP, even Jehovah's Witnesses, whose movement was detached from politics, and whose members declined to join MCP. All forms of political intolerance and violence increased before the 1963 pre-independence elections.<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 242\u20134.</ref>\n\nIn May 1964, Chiume looked forward to Malawi being organised with no opposition at all and claimed that there was nothing wrong with dictatorship. Banda went further in saying that any government chosen by the people themselves was not a dictatorship. By the time that many of the ministers had concerns about the reintroduction of Preventive Detention in July 1964, the possibility of reasoned opposition to Banda was long past. The Cabinet Crisis did not therefore represent any change in the nature of MCP, merely that, as external enemies had been subdued, its leader made enemies of the party's own long term members.<ref>J McCracken, (1998). Democracy and Nationalism in Historical Perspective, pp. 245, 248-9.</ref>\n\n==After the Crisis and Chipembere's Revolt==\n\n===The ministers leave===\nIn October 1964, Chokani and Bwanausi, who had refused to rejoin the cabinet without their colleagues, left voluntarily for Zambia following Banda's refusal to negotiate. Chiume and Chisiza, who had gone to the north of Malawi in September, both crossed into Tanzania (as Tanganyika had become) on 1 October because they feared for their safety. Chirwa met Banda in the hope of serving as a judge but was beaten up by Banda's guards, and went into hiding before leaving secretly for Tanzania on 22 October. Chipembere had remained at his home in [[Mangochi District|Fort Johnston District]], avoiding any contact with Banda or Jones, under the protection of numerous local supporters. On 25 October, Banda claimed at an MPC meeting that the ex-ministers were plotting to overthrow him by force. Chipembere left his house on 28 October to go into hiding, following which Banda ordered his arrest, \"...&nbsp;alive if possible, but if not alive then any other way.\"<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 439\u201340.</ref> After Cameron had resigned in July 1964, he was advised to leave the country in November 1964, and returned to Scotland.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 355.</ref>\n\nThe British government thought an outcome to the crisis in which Banda shed some of his powers to the ministers but remained in charge would be ideal but, failing that, it was prepared to back him against his ministers. There was the fear that Chipembere and Chiume would align Malawi too closely with China, whereas Banda would be more favourable to British interests. Glyn Jones, as Governor-general was in a difficult position as he could only advise and had no executive power. In September 1964 his frequent meeting with Banda and the ministers, except for Chiume (who refused to meet him), both before and after they left office, were aimed at an accommodation between Banda and at least some of the ministers. His constitutional duty was however to support Banda once he had won the vote of confidence. Chipembere later claimed that expatriate civil servants and security officers had turned Banda against him and his colleagues. While there is little doubt that many expatriates preferred Banda to Chipembere and Chiume, there is no real evidence that they caused this estrangement.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 446.</ref>\n\n===Armed conflict===\nAlthough there was widespread dissatisfaction in the north of Malawi, there was no major uprising there after the Cabinet Crisis. There was concern that Chiume and Chisiza would mount an invasion from Tanzania, but the armed uprising was in the south. After Chipembere went into hiding in the east of Fort Johnston District, he gathered a group of supports including politicians, civil servants and young activists which controlled much of the district. He set up a training camp and on the night of 12 February 1965 led about 200 supporters into Fort Johnston to attack the police station. They then attempted to reach the capital, Zomba, around 100 miles away. Chipembere's exact intentions are unknown, but he may have hoped that the army based in Zomba would come out in support of the rising. His small force was stopped at the [[Liwonde]] ferry by security forces and, after some fighting, it fled in disorder.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, pp. 440\u20135.</ref>\n\nAlthough there was a reward for his capture, Chipembere was able to remain in the Fort Johnston District until March when, ill with diabetes, he wrote to Jones, the Governor-general offering to leave Malawi in return for an amnesty. Banda at first rejected this, but after Chipembere contacted the US ambassador in early April, it was arranged (with Banda's consent) that he should leave Malawi and travel, through Southern Rhodesia and London, to the USA. He agreed not to plot against Banda there. Chipembere later claimed that an amnesty had been promised for his followers, but many of them were detained and a few continued raids on government targets for some time, leading to retaliatory burning of local villages and the public hanging of one of the leaders in January 1966. Many of Chipembere supporters were [[Yao people (East Africa)|Yao]] and Banda promoted the recruitment of members of the rival [[Lomwe language|Lomwe]] group as paramilitary police to contain them.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 449.</ref> During and after the suppression of Chipembere's armed uprising, several hundred civil servants were sacked, or detained along with other of his supposed supporters, and chiefs suspected of sympathising with him were deposed.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, (1965). The Rise of Nationalism in Central Africa, pp. 321.</ref>\n\nThere had been a minor incursion from Tanzania in March 1965 by fighters loyal to Yatuta Chisiza, when two of his fighters were killed. In September 1967, Chisiza himself led a force of less than 20 that had trained in Zambia through Mozambique into the [[Mwanza District]]. They were spotted by police on 3 October and nine were captured over the next few days. Chisiza himself was killed in a shoot-out with troops on 11 October and his corpse was publicly displayed on Banda's orders.<ref>J McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859\u20131966, p. 445.</ref>\n\n==The Fates of the Ministers==\nSeveral of the ministers that fled from Malawi after the Cabinet Crisis died abroad, but a number survived to return to Malawi after Banda was deposed and returned to public life. Several of those that had supported Banda at the time of the cabinet crisis later suffered demotion, dismissal or imprisonment at his hands. One of the new ministers appointed after the Cabinet Crisis in 1964, [[Albert Muwalo]], was hanged for treason in 1976.<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi.</ref>\n\nChipembere first studied at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), then taught in Tanzania from 1966 to 1969, before returning to UCLA to complete his doctorate and receive treatment for diabetes. He later taught at the [[California State University]]. Between 1970 and 1975, he worked on his autobiography, which was incomplete on his death. He died on 24 September 1975 from complications of his diabetes without returning to Malawi. After Banda was removed in 1993, Chipembere's reputation was rehabilitated.<ref>R. I. Rotberg, Chipembere obituary, Harvard Magazine May\u2013June 2010. http://harvardmagazine.com/2010/05/vita-masauko-chipembere</ref>\n\nChiume was in exile in Tanzania from 1964 to 1994, where he became active in journalism and set up a political movement aimed at promoting change in Malawi. He returned to Malawi in 1994 after Banda's removal and became chairman of the Malawi National Library Service until he retired in 1996. He then lived in his home district of Nkhata Bay until 2002, when he moved to New York because of his health, and died there on 21 November 2007.<ref>Chiume biography http://www.kanyamachiume.com/about.html</ref>\n\n[[Orton Chirwa]] settled in Tanzania, where he taught and practised law. On Christmas Eve 1981, Chirwa, his wife, Vera and their son were abducted from Zambia by Malawian security officials, possibly after being tricked into going to the border area. Two years later Orton and [[Vera Chirwa]] were put on trial for treason in a [[Traditional Courts in Malawi|\"traditional\" court]] and not allowed defence counsel. They were found guilty and sentenced to death, but after many appeals for clemency this was commuted to life in prison. Orton Chirwa died in Zomba prison on 20 October 1992, after nearly 11 years in solitary confinement. When he died, he was virtually deaf and blind.<ref>Chirwa obituary, Independent 22 October 1992, https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-orton-chirwa-1558842.html</ref>\n\n[[Willie Chokani]] and [[Augustine Bwanausi]] left for Zambia in October 1964, where they became schoolteachers. Chokani became a headmaster of a secondary school and a college lecturer before moving to Tanzania where he was active in Malawian exile politics. He returned to Malawi in 1993 and was Malawi's Ambassador to the USA from 1994 to 1999, then Ambassador to Ethiopia and High Commissioner to Namibia before his retirement. Bwanausi remained as a teacher in Zambia until his death in a car accident in 1973.<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi.</ref>\n \nAfter her dismissal as parliamentary secretary and from the Women's League, Rose Chibambo resigned as an MP and joined her husband who was in the district administration of [[Chiradzulu]] and later [[Mwanza]], but after threats from MCP members, they both fled to Zambia in early 1965. Her husband died in Zambia in 1968, but she survived to return to Malawi in 1994.<ref>J Power, (2010). Political Culture and Nationalism in Malawi, p. 187.</ref> Msonthi took over Chipembere's former post as Minister for Education, and served in several cabinet posts until his removal on charges of breaching MCP party discipline in 1973. He was internally exiled to his home district for five years, before partial rehabilitation and being given a post in a government parastatal, which he held until his death in 1982.<ref>C Baker, (2001). Revolt of the Ministers: The Malawi Cabinet Crisis 1964\u20131965 p. 179.</ref>\n\nAleke Banda, who had become Secretary-General of MCP in 1962, became a cabinet minister in 1962, and served in three cabinet posts before being dismissed by Banda in 1973. In 1975, he was appointed managing director of Press Holdings Ltd, a company controlled by Banda but in 1979 was detained without charge for 12 years. After Banda's removal, he re-entered politics in opposition to MCP, and between 1997 and 2005 held two cabinet posts. He retired through illness in 2005 and died from leukaemia in 2010. John Tembo ceased to be a cabinet minister in 1971, becoming Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi but retaining his MCP position. In 1982, Tembo left the Reserve Bank and, although he held no ministerial office until 1989, he was a close advisor to Banda and held a number of posts in parastatal bodies. In 1989, he became MCP treasurer and again held ministerial office. In 1995 he was accused, along with Banda of murder, but acquitted. After 1994, Tembo remained with MCP and in politics, and is currently Malawi's [[Leader of the Opposition]].<ref>O J M Kalinga, (2012).

After declaring their independence in 1821 the Mexicans also asserted themselves in opposition to the Russians: the [[Mission San Francisco de Solano]] (Sonoma Mission-1823) specifically responded to the presence of the Russians at Fort Ross; and Mexico established the [[Presidio of Sonoma|El Presidio Real de Sonoma]] or ''Sonoma Barracks'' in 1836, with General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] as the 'Commandant of the Northern Frontier' of the [[Alta California]] Province. The fort was the northernmost Mexican outpost to halt any further Russian settlement southward. The restored Presidio and mission are in the present day city of [[Sonoma, California]].\n\nIn 1920 a one-hundred [[Pound (weight)|pound]] bronze church bell was unearthed{{by whom|date=April 2015}} in an orange grove near [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a]] in the [[History of the San Fernando Valley to 1915|San Fernando Valley]] of [[Southern California]]. It has an inscription in the [[Russian language]] (translated here): \"In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of [[Juvenaly of Alaska]], during the sojourn of [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov]].\" How this [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] church artifact from [[Kodiak Island]] in [[Alaska]] arrived at a [[Spanish missions in California|Roman Catholic Mission]] Church in [[Southern California]] remains unknown.\n\n==Purchase of Alaska==\n{{Main|Alaska Purchase}}\nThe Russian colonies were rarely profitable, primarily due to transportation costs for supplies. In addition, Russia was in a difficult financial position and feared losing Russian Alaska without compensation in some future conflict, especially to the British. The Russians believed that in a dispute with Britain, their hard-to-defend region might become a prime target for British aggression from [[British Columbia]], and would be easily captured. So following the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]], [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] instructed the Russian minister to the United States, [[Eduard de Stoeckl]], to enter into negotiations with the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] in the beginning of March 1867. At the instigation of Seward the [[United States Senate]] approved the purchase, known as the [[Alaska Purchase]], from the [[Russian Empire]]. The cost was set at 2 cents an acre, which came to a total of $7,200,000 on 9 April 1867. The canceled check is in the present day [[United States National Archives]].\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) released a [[Commemorative coins of the Soviet Union|series of commemorative coins]] in 1990 and 1991 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the first sighting of and claiming domain over [[Alaska]]\u2013[[Russian America]]. The commemoration consisted of a [[silver coin]], a [[platinum coin]] and two [[palladium coin]]s in both years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, a resurgence of Russian ultra nationalism has spurred regret and recrimination over the sale of Alaska to the United States.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Soraya Sarhaddi |title=Not An April Fools' Joke: Russians Petition To Get Alaska Back |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/04/01/297835873/not-an-april-fools-joke-russians-petition-to-get-alaska-back |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=NPR |date=1 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tetrault-Farber |first1=Gabrielle |title=After Crimea, Russians Say They Want Alaska Back |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/03/31/after-crimea-russians-say-they-want-alaska-back-a33489 |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=The Moscow Times |date=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gershkovich |first1=Evan |title=150 Years After Sale of Alaska, Some Russians Have Second Thoughts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/europe/alaska-russia-sale-150.html |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=30 March 2017}}</ref> There are periodic [[mass media]] stories in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] that [[Alaska]] was not sold to the United States in the 1867 [[Alaska Purchase]], but only leased for 99 years (= to 1966), or 150 years (= to 2017)\u2014and will be returned to Russia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Haycox |first1=Steve |title=Russian extremists want Alaska back |url=https://www.adn.com/opinions/2017/05/18/russian-extremists-want-alaska-back/ |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=18 May 2017}}</ref> However, the Alaska Purchase Treaty is absolutely clear that the agreement was for a complete Russian [[cession]] of the territory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcription of the English text of the Alaska Treaty of Cession |url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=41&page=transcript |website=Our Documents |publisher=The United States National Archives |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Orthodox Church===\n\n{{Main|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}\n[[Saint Herman of Alaska]], [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]] and [[Saint Peter the Aleut]] have contributed historically to the strong Russian Orthodox Church community in Alaska.

After declaring their independence in 1821 the Mexicans also asserted themselves in opposition to the Russians: the [[Mission San Francisco de Solano]] (Sonoma Mission-1823) specifically responded to the presence of the Russians at Fort Ross; and Mexico established the [[Presidio of Sonoma|El Presidio Real de Sonoma]] or ''Sonoma Barracks'' in 1836, with General [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] as the 'Commandant of the Northern Frontier' of the [[Alta California]] Province. The fort was the northernmost Mexican outpost to halt any further Russian settlement southward. The restored Presidio and mission are in the present day city of [[Sonoma, California]].\n\nIn 1920 a one-hundred [[Pound (weight)|pound]] bronze church bell was unearthed{{by whom|date=April 2015}} in an orange grove near [[Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a]] in the [[History of the San Fernando Valley to 1915|San Fernando Valley]] of [[Southern California]]. It has an inscription in the [[Russian language]] (translated here): \"In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of [[Juvenaly of Alaska]], during the sojourn of [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov]].\" How this [[Russian Orthodox]] [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak]] church artifact from [[Kodiak Island]] in [[Alaska]] arrived at a [[Spanish missions in California|Roman Catholic Mission]] Church in [[Southern California]] remains unknown.\n\n==Purchase of Alaska==\n{{Main|Alaska Purchase}}\nThe Russian colonies were rarely profitable, primarily due to transportation costs for supplies. In addition, Russia was in a difficult financial position and feared losing Russian Alaska without compensation in some future conflict, especially to the British. The Russians believed that in a dispute with Britain, their hard-to-defend region might become a prime target for British aggression from [[British Columbia]], and would be easily captured. So following the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]], [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] instructed the Russian minister to the United States, [[Eduard de Stoeckl]], to enter into negotiations with the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]] in the beginning of March 1867. At the instigation of Seward the [[United States Senate]] approved the purchase, known as the [[Alaska Purchase]], from the [[Russian Empire]]. The cost was set at 2 cents an acre, which came to a total of $7,200,000 on 9 April 1867. The canceled check is in the present day [[United States National Archives]].\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Soviet Union]] (USSR) released a [[Commemorative coins of the Soviet Union|series of commemorative coins]] in 1990 and 1991 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the first sighting of and claiming domain over [[Alaska]]\u2013[[Russian America]]. The commemoration consisted of a [[silver coin]], a [[platinum coin]] and two [[palladium coin]]s in both years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, a resurgence of Russian ultra nationalism has spurred regret and recrimination over the sale of Alaska to the United States.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Nelson |first1=Soraya Sarhaddi |title=Not An April Fools' Joke: Russians Petition To Get Alaska Back |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/04/01/297835873/not-an-april-fools-joke-russians-petition-to-get-alaska-back |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=NPR |date=1 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Tetrault-Farber |first1=Gabrielle |title=After Crimea, Russians Say They Want Alaska Back |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2014/03/31/after-crimea-russians-say-they-want-alaska-back-a33489 |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=The Moscow Times |date=31 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Gershkovich |first1=Evan |title=150 Years After Sale of Alaska, Some Russians Have Second Thoughts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/europe/alaska-russia-sale-150.html |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=The New York Times |date=30 March 2017}}</ref> There are periodic [[mass media]] stories in the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] that [[Alaska]] was not sold to the United States in the 1867 [[Alaska Purchase]], but only leased for 99 years (= to 1966), or 150 years (= to 2017)\u2014and will be returned to Russia.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Haycox |first1=Steve |title=Russian extremists want Alaska back |url=https://www.adn.com/opinions/2017/05/18/russian-extremists-want-alaska-back/ |accessdate=26 November 2019 |work=Anchorage Daily News |date=18 May 2017}}</ref> However, the Alaska Purchase Treaty is absolutely clear that the agreement was for a complete Russian [[cession]] of the territory.<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcription of the English text of the Alaska Treaty of Cession |url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=false&doc=41&page=transcript |website=Our Documents |publisher=The United States National Archives |accessdate=26 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Orthodox Church===\n\n{{Main|Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia}}\n[[Saint Herman of Alaska]], [[Saint Innocent of Alaska]] and [[Saint Peter the Aleut]] have contributed historically to the strong Russian Orthodox Church community in Alaska.

They were widely used for private and light aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Cirrus engine originated in [[Geoffrey de Havilland]]'s quest for a powerplant suited to a light two-seat sports biplane which would become the [[de Havilland Moth]]. The [[Aircraft Disposal Company]], also known as Airdisco and ADC, were producing the low-cost [[ADC Airdisco|Airdisco]] V8 which had been developed by [[Frank Halford]] from their large stocks of war surplus [[Renault]] V8 aero engines. De Havilland realised that half of this engine would make an air-cooled four-cylinder inline engine of just the right size and at very low cost. He persuaded Halford to undertake its design and development. It became the first Cirrus engine.<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref>\n\nThe original '''ADC Cirrus''' engines were all designed by Halford and built by ADC. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) Cirrus I, passed its 50-hour [[Type certificate|type rating]] in 1925. De Havilland launched his product as the [[de Havilland Cirrus Moth|Cirrus Moth]] and it proved a winning formula. The engine was soon adopted for other aircraft. Later versions named the Cirrus II, and Cirrus III were produced each with slightly greater displacement and power (Cirrus II - 85&nbsp;hp, Cirrus III - 90&nbsp;hp).<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref><ref name=\"gunston\">Gunston 1989</ref>\n\nWhen ADC ran out of the Renault engines, Cirrus Aero Engines Limited was formed in 1927 to manufacture the Cirrus models from scratch.\n\nThe Cirrus III was also produced/converted by American Cirrus Engines Inc., Belleville NJ (later A.C.E. Corp, Marysville MI.).\n\nThe Cirrus company became Cirrus Hermes in 1931 when it was bought by the [[Hermes Engine Company]]. The next model line, Hermes I, II, III and IV were produced ranging in power from 105&nbsp;hp to 140&nbsp;hp depending on type.\n<ref>Lumsden 2003, p.132.</ref>\n\nWhile the Hermes II and III were uprights like their predecessors, the Hermes II B introduced a major change with the cylinders being inverted for the first time. The resulting high propeller line allowed the top of the engine to be lowered, which significantly improved the pilot's view in a single-engined type. All subsequent models would be inverted.<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref><ref name=\"gunston\">Gunston 1989</ref>\n\nIn 1934 the company was taken over again by [[Blackburn Aircraft Limited]] and moved to Brough in Yorkshire. The company continued manufacturing selling the engines under its old name. In 1935 it launched the [[Blackburn Cirrus Minor|Cirrus Minor]] and [[Blackburn Cirrus Major|Cirrus Major]].\n\nDuring and after WWII Blackburn produced uprated versions of the Cirrus Minor and Major. In 1948 it introduced the [[Blackburn Cirrus Bombardier]] with fuel injection and a higher compression ratio, giving increased output.<ref name=\"Lumsden\">Lumsden 2003, p. 130.</ref>\n\nWhen Blackburn Aircraft merged with [[General Aircraft Limited]] (GAL) in 1949, becoming Blackburn & General Aircraft Limited, it continued to market the Minor, Major and Bombardier range until the late 1950s.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Cirrus engines.jpg|thumb|A comparison of Cirrus Hermes I (left) and Cirrus III (right)]]\n[[File:Cirrus-Hermes I in Roe IV triplane replica.jpg|thumb|Cirrus-Hermes I engine in Roe IV replica, Shuttleworth collection]]\nVariants are listed under the brand which introduced them.

They were widely used for private and light aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Cirrus engine originated in [[Geoffrey de Havilland]]'s quest for a powerplant suited to a light two-seat sports biplane which would become the [[de Havilland Moth]]. The [[Aircraft Disposal Company]], also known as Airdisco and ADC, were producing the low-cost [[ADC Airdisco|Airdisco]] V8 which had been developed by [[Frank Halford]] from their large stocks of war surplus [[Renault]] V8 aero engines. De Havilland realised that half of this engine would make an air-cooled four-cylinder inline engine of just the right size and at very low cost. He persuaded Halford to undertake its design and development. It became the first Cirrus engine.<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref>\n\nThe original '''ADC Cirrus''' engines were all designed by Halford and built by ADC. The 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW) Cirrus I, passed its 50-hour [[Type certificate|type rating]] in 1925. De Havilland launched his product as the [[de Havilland Cirrus Moth|Cirrus Moth]] and it proved a winning formula. The engine was soon adopted for other aircraft. Later versions named the Cirrus II, and Cirrus III were produced each with slightly greater displacement and power (Cirrus II - 85&nbsp;hp, Cirrus III - 90&nbsp;hp).<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref><ref name=\"gunston\">Gunston 1989</ref>\n\nWhen ADC ran out of the Renault engines, Cirrus Aero Engines Limited was formed in 1927 to manufacture the Cirrus models from scratch.\n\nThe Cirrus III was also produced/converted by American Cirrus Engines Inc., Belleville NJ (later A.C.E. Corp, Marysville MI.).\n\nThe Cirrus company became Cirrus Hermes in 1931 when it was bought by the [[Hermes Engine Company]]. The next model line, Hermes I, II, III and IV were produced ranging in power from 105&nbsp;hp to 140&nbsp;hp depending on type.\n<ref>Lumsden 2003, p.132.</ref>\n\nWhile the Hermes II and III were uprights like their predecessors, the Hermes II B introduced a major change with the cylinders being inverted for the first time. The resulting high propeller line allowed the top of the engine to be lowered, which significantly improved the pilot's view in a single-engined type. All subsequent models would be inverted.<ref name=\"Taylor>Taylor 1999</ref><ref name=\"gunston\">Gunston 1989</ref>\n\nIn 1934 the company was taken over again by [[Blackburn Aircraft Limited]] and moved to Brough in Yorkshire. The company continued manufacturing selling the engines under its old name. In 1935 it launched the [[Blackburn Cirrus Minor|Cirrus Minor]] and [[Blackburn Cirrus Major|Cirrus Major]].\n\nDuring and after WWII Blackburn produced uprated versions of the Cirrus Minor and Major. In 1948 it introduced the [[Blackburn Cirrus Bombardier]] with fuel injection and a higher compression ratio, giving increased output.<ref name=\"Lumsden\">Lumsden 2003, p. 130.</ref>\n\nWhen Blackburn Aircraft merged with [[General Aircraft Limited]] (GAL) in 1949, becoming Blackburn & General Aircraft Limited, it continued to market the Minor, Major and Bombardier range until the late 1950s.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Cirrus engines.jpg|thumb|A comparison of Cirrus Hermes I (left) and Cirrus III (right)]]\n[[File:Cirrus-Hermes I in Roe IV triplane replica.jpg|thumb|Cirrus-Hermes I engine in Roe IV replica, Shuttleworth collection]]\nVariants are listed under the brand which introduced them.

The type possessed low operational costs and initially had scant competition in the 100-seat short-range [[regional jet]] class, contributing to strong sales upon introduction in the late 1980s.\n\nAn increasing number of similar airliners were brought to market by competitors during the 1990s, leading to a substantial decline in both sales and long-term prospects for the 100. Fokker also encountered financial difficulties and was bought up by [[DASA|Deutsche Aerospace AG]], which had financial troubles of its own, restricting its ability to support multiple regional airliner programmes. In 1997, production of the Fokker 100 was terminated after 283 airframes had been delivered.\n\nBy July 2019, a total of 101 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 19 airlines around the world.<ref>Thisdell and Seymour ''Flight International'' 30 July \u20135 August 2019, p. 46.</ref> Since the 2000s, airlines are retiring the aircraft, but there are still large numbers in operation in Australia and Iran.<ref name=\"nyt-dec-26-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Troianovsky |first1=Anton |last2=Victor |first2=Daniel |title=At Least 9 Killed in Plane Crash in Kazakhstan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/asia/plane-crash-almaty-kazakhstan.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2019 |date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\nThe ''F28 Mark 0100'' \u201cFokker 100\u201d is based on the [[Fokker F28]] Mark 4000 [[re-engine]]d with two [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay]] high by-pass ratio turbofans and a [[fuselage stretch]]ed by {{cvt|18.83|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nIts wing is wider by {{cvt|9.8|ft}}, has new flaps and larger ailerons, and extended leading and trailing edges improve aerodynamics and increase the [[chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]].<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe landing gear is strengthened and has new wheels and brakes, and the [[horizontal stabilizer]] is widened by {{cvt|4.6|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nMaximum weights are increased while fuel capacity, max speed and ceiling remain the same, and passenger capacity went from 85 to 109.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe flight deck went digital with a [[flight management system]], an autopilot/[[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] including CAT III [[autoland]], [[Autothrust|thrust management]] system, [[Electronic flight instrument system|electronic flight instrument]] displays and full [[ARINC]] avionics.<ref name=TCDS>{{cite web |url= https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/TCDS_EASA.A.037_Fokker_F28_Iss_07_20180903%20FINAL.PDF |title= Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A.037 for Fokker F28 |publisher= EASA |date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new wing was claimed to be 30% more efficient in cruise, while retaining the simplicity of a fixed [[leading edge]]. The cockpit was updated with a [[Rockwell Collins]] DU-1000 EFIS.

The type possessed low operational costs and initially had scant competition in the 100-seat short-range [[regional jet]] class, contributing to strong sales upon introduction in the late 1980s.\n\nAn increasing number of similar airliners were brought to market by competitors during the 1990s, leading to a substantial decline in both sales and long-term prospects for the 100. Fokker also encountered financial difficulties and was bought up by [[DASA|Deutsche Aerospace AG]], which had financial troubles of its own, restricting its ability to support multiple regional airliner programmes. In 1997, production of the Fokker 100 was terminated after 283 airframes had been delivered.\n\nBy July 2019, a total of 101 Fokker 100 aircraft remained in airline service with 19 airlines around the world.<ref>Thisdell and Seymour ''Flight International'' 30 July \u20135 August 2019, p. 46.</ref> Since the 2000s, airlines are retiring the aircraft, but there are still large numbers in operation in Australia and Iran.<ref name=\"nyt-dec-26-2019\">{{cite web |last1=Troianovsky |first1=Anton |last2=Victor |first2=Daniel |title=At Least 9 Killed in Plane Crash in Kazakhstan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/26/world/asia/plane-crash-almaty-kazakhstan.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2019 |date=26 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n\nThe ''F28 Mark 0100'' \u201cFokker 100\u201d is based on the [[Fokker F28]] Mark 4000 [[re-engine]]d with two [[Rolls-Royce RB.183 Tay]] high by-pass ratio turbofans and a [[fuselage stretch]]ed by {{cvt|18.83|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nIts wing is wider by {{cvt|9.8|ft}}, has new flaps and larger ailerons, and extended leading and trailing edges improve aerodynamics and increase the [[chord (aeronautics)|wing chord]].<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe landing gear is strengthened and has new wheels and brakes, and the [[horizontal stabilizer]] is widened by {{cvt|4.6|ft}}.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nMaximum weights are increased while fuel capacity, max speed and ceiling remain the same, and passenger capacity went from 85 to 109.<!--<ref name=TCDS>-->\nThe flight deck went digital with a [[flight management system]], an autopilot/[[Flight director (aeronautics)|flight director]] including CAT III [[autoland]], [[Autothrust|thrust management]] system, [[Electronic flight instrument system|electronic flight instrument]] displays and full [[ARINC]] avionics.<ref name=TCDS>{{cite web |url= https://www.easa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/dfu/TCDS_EASA.A.037_Fokker_F28_Iss_07_20180903%20FINAL.PDF |title= Type Certificate Data Sheet No. A.037 for Fokker F28 |publisher= EASA |date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe new wing was claimed to be 30% more efficient in cruise, while retaining the simplicity of a fixed [[leading edge]]. The cockpit was updated with a [[Rockwell Collins]] DU-1000 EFIS. Like the Fokker Fellowship, the Fokker 100 retained the twin rear fuselage-mounted engines and [[T-tail]] configuration, like the [[Douglas DC-9]] family. It lacks the F28 eyebrow windows above the cockpit.\n\n==Development==\n\nA [[Type Certificate]] was applied for on 25 March 1983.<ref name=TCDS/> The program was announced in 1983.

The most potent are members of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'', such as ''[[Psilocybe azurescens|P.&nbsp;azurescens]]'', ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata|P.&nbsp;semilanceata]]'', and ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens|P.&nbsp;cyanescens]]'', but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other [[genera]]. As a [[prodrug]]<!--is it both a pro-drug and a hallucinogen in its own right?  this should be clarified-->, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to [[psilocin]], which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[mescaline]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]. In general, the effects include [[euphoria]], visual and mental [[hallucination]]s, changes in [[perception]], a distorted [[time perception|sense of time]], and spiritual experiences, and can also include possible adverse reactions such as [[nausea]] and [[panic attack]]s. \n\nImagery found on prehistoric [[mural]]s and [[rock painting]]s of modern-day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In [[Mesoamerica]], the mushrooms had long been consumed in [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[divination|divinatory]] ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In 1959, the Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''. Hofmann's employer [[Sandoz]] marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in [[Psychedelic therapy#Psycholytic therapy|psychedelic psychotherapy]]. Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, its popularity as an [[entheogen]] (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nThe intensity and duration of the effects of psilocybin are variable, depending on species or [[cultivar]] of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and [[set and setting]], as was shown in experiments led by [[Timothy Leary]] at [[Harvard University]] in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on [[serotonin receptor]]s in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low [[toxicity]] and a low harm potential. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|scheduled drug]] by many national [[Prohibition of drugs|drug laws]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Timothy-Leary-Los-Angeles-1989.jpg|thumb|right|American psychologist and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] figure Timothy Leary conducted early experiments into the effects of psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin. (1989 photo)]]\nThe effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on the mindset and environment in which the user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as [[set and setting]]. In the early 1960s, [[Timothy Leary]] and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens [[suggestibility]], making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli.<ref name=Leary1963/> These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.<ref name=Berge1999/>\n\nAfter ingesting psilocybin, a wide range of subjective effects may be experienced: feelings of [[disorientation]], [[lethargy]], [[wiktionary:giddy|giddiness]], [[euphoria]], joy, and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. In one study 31% of volunteers who had been given a high dose reported feelings of significant fear and 17% experienced transient [[paranoia]].<ref name=Amsterdam2011/> In studies at [[Johns Hopkins]], among those given a moderate dose (but still enough to \u201cgive a high probability of a profound and beneficial experience\u201d) negative experiences were rare, whereas 1/3 of those given the high dose experienced anxiety or paranoia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_ |title= Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Eases Existential Anxiety in People With Life-Threatening Cancer|publisher=Johns Hopkins |access-date=April 9, 2019|date = December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Hopkins2011\">{{cite journal |title= Psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences: Immediate and persisting dose-related effects|journal= Johns Hopkins |date =June 15, 2011 |pmc=3308357 |pmid=21674151 |doi=10.1007/s00213-011-2358-5 |volume=218 |issue= 4 |pages=649\u201365 |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW, Richards WA, Richards BD, McCann U, Jesse R}}</ref> Low doses of the drug can induce hallucinatory effects.

Users having an unpleasant experience (a \"[[bad trip]]\") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase \"bad trip\" is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including \"tripping\" during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: ''[[set and setting]]''). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/><ref name=Attema2007/> Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the ''Psychedelics Encyclopedia'', author [[Peter Stafford]] noted, \"The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating.

Reflecting the meaning of the word ''entheogen'' (\"the god within\"), the mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual [[sacrament]]s that provide access to sacred worlds. Typically used in small group community settings, they enhance [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] and reaffirm traditional values.<ref name=Winkelman2007/> [[Terence McKenna]] documented the worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural [[ethos]] relating to the Earth and mysteries of nature, and suggested that mushrooms enhanced [[self-awareness]] and a sense of contact with a \"Transcendent Other\"\u2014reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature.<ref name=McKenna1992/>\n\nPsychedelic drugs can induce states of [[consciousness]] that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined; these states are called [[mystical experience]]s. Some scholars have proposed that many of the qualities of a drug-induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through [[Religious experience#Causes of religious experiences|non-drug techniques]], such as [[meditation]] or [[holotropic breathwork]].<ref name=James1997/><ref name=Metzner1998/> In the 1960s, [[Walter Pahnke]] and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences (which they called \"mystical consciousness\") by categorizing their common features. These categories, according to Pahnke, \"describe the core of a universal psychological experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations\", and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative, numerical scale.<ref name=Pahnke1969/>\n\nIn the 1962 [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]], which was run by Pahnke at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] under the supervision of Timothy Leary,<ref name=Pahnke1966/> almost all of the graduate degree [[seminary|divinity]] student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences.<ref name=Griffiths2008/> One of the participants was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]; he later described his experience as \"the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced.\"<ref name=Smith2000/> In a 25-year followup to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of \"a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life\".<ref>Doblin (1991), p. 13.</ref> Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire.

The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood;<ref name=Hood1975/> 61% of subjects reported a \"complete mystical experience\" after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased [[life satisfaction]] and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme \"experience of fear\" or [[dysphoria]] (i.e., a \"bad trip\") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.<ref name=\"urlMedical News: Psilocybin Viewed as Therapy or Research Tool - in Psychiatry, Addictions from MedPage Today\"/>\n\nA follow-up study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction.<ref name=Griffiths2008/> Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of [[Openness to experience|Openness/Intellect]]; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/><ref name=CarhartHarris2010/>\n\nWhile many recent studies have concluded that psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance, not all the medical community is on board.  [[Paul R. McHugh]], formerly director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at [[Johns Hopkins]], responded as follows in a book review: \"The unmentioned fact in ''The Harvard Psychedelic Club'' is that LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and the like produce not a \u201chigher consciousness\u201d but rather a particular kind of \u201clower consciousness\u201d known well to psychiatrists and neurologists\u2014namely, \u201c[[Toxicity|toxic]] [[delirium]].\u201d\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-harvard-psychedelic-club-by-don-lattin/ |title= Paul McHugh reviews Don Lattin's \"The Harvard Psychedelic Club.\" |publisher=commentarymagazine.com |access-date=April 10, 2019|date = April 1, 2010}}</ref>  In response to Dr. McHugh\u2019s denial that the mystical experience leads to insight, Michael Pollan points to Roland Griffiths, Johns Hopkins researcher and author of many studies finding that the experiences of many of the participants have actually involved substantial and sustained personal meaning bringing enduring positive changes in psychological functioning.<ref name=Griffiths2017/><ref name=Griffiths2006/> According to Pollan, Griffiths admits that those taking psilocybin may be encountering a temporary psychosis, but notes that the patients McHugh describes are unlikely to report years later of their experience:  \"Wow, that was one of the greatest and most meaningful experiences of my life\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trippingly.net/lsd-studies/2018/5/15/how-to-change-your-mind |title=How to Change Your Mind |publisher=www.trippingly.net |access-date=April 22, 2019|date =February 1, 2019 }}</ref> Such responses argue that it is not appropriate to automatically equate a psilocybin-induced experience of profound insight with superficially similar experiences of psychiatric patients (characterized as mere toxic delirium), when it is only the \u201cinsight\u201d reached in the psilocybin experience that is reported to often result in profound, beneficial and enduring life changes for the person.\n\nIn 2011, Griffiths and colleagues published the results of further studies designed to learn more about the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life-changing experiences, while minimizing the chance of negative reactions. In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a \"monitor\" or \"guide\" whom the volunteers supposedly trusted. The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety. The volunteers and monitors all remained [[blind experiment|blind]] to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment.<ref name=Griffiths2011/>\n\n===Available forms===\nAlthough psilocybin may be prepared synthetically, outside of the research setting it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a [[herbal tea]], or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste.<ref name=EMCDDA/> In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts [[intravenous]]ly.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\n\nMost of the comparatively few fatal incidents reported in the literature that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs, especially [[ethanol|alcohol]]. Probably the most common cause of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve \"bad trips\" or [[panic attack|panic reactions]], in which affected individuals become extremely anxious, confused, agitated, or disoriented.

In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year.<ref name=Matsushima2009/> Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule_I_controlled_substances|Schedule&nbsp;I category]] of illicit drugs in 1970.

[[prodrug]] compound produced by more than [[List of Psilocybin mushrooms|200 species]] of [[mushroom]]s, collectively known as [[psilocybin mushroom]]s. The most potent are members of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'', such as ''[[Psilocybe azurescens|P.&nbsp;azurescens]]'', ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata|P.&nbsp;semilanceata]]'', and ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens|P.&nbsp;cyanescens]]'', but psilocybin has also been isolated from about a dozen other [[genera]]. As a [[prodrug]]<!--is it both a pro-drug and a hallucinogen in its own right?  this should be clarified-->, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to [[psilocin]], which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], [[mescaline]], and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]]. In general, the effects include [[euphoria]], visual and mental [[hallucination]]s, changes in [[perception]], a distorted [[time perception|sense of time]], and spiritual experiences, and can also include possible adverse reactions such as [[nausea]] and [[panic attack]]s. \n\nImagery found on prehistoric [[mural]]s and [[rock painting]]s of modern-day Spain and Algeria suggests that human usage of psilocybin mushrooms predates recorded history. In [[Mesoamerica]], the mushrooms had long been consumed in [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[divination|divinatory]] ceremonies before Spanish chroniclers first documented their use in the 16th century. In 1959, the Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] isolated the active principle psilocybin from the mushroom ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]''. Hofmann's employer [[Sandoz]] marketed and sold pure psilocybin to physicians and clinicians worldwide for use in [[Psychedelic therapy#Psycholytic therapy|psychedelic psychotherapy]]. Although the increasingly restrictive drug laws of the late 1960s curbed scientific research into the effects of psilocybin and other hallucinogens, its popularity as an [[entheogen]] (spirituality-enhancing agent) grew in the next decade, owing largely to the increased availability of information on how to cultivate psilocybin mushrooms.\n\nThe intensity and duration of the effects of psilocybin are variable, depending on species or [[cultivar]] of mushrooms, dosage, individual physiology, and [[set and setting]], as was shown in experiments led by [[Timothy Leary]] at [[Harvard University]] in the early 1960s. Once ingested, psilocybin is rapidly metabolized to psilocin, which then acts on [[serotonin receptor]]s in the brain. The mind-altering effects of psilocybin typically last from two to six hours, although to individuals under the influence of psilocybin, the effects may seem to last much longer, since the drug can distort the perception of time. Psilocybin has a low [[toxicity]] and a low harm potential. Possession of psilocybin-containing mushrooms has been outlawed in most countries, and it has been classified as a [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|scheduled drug]] by many national [[Prohibition of drugs|drug laws]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Timothy-Leary-Los-Angeles-1989.jpg|thumb|right|American psychologist and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] figure Timothy Leary conducted early experiments into the effects of psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin. (1989 photo)]]\nThe effects of psilocybin are highly variable and depend on the mindset and environment in which the user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as [[set and setting]]. In the early 1960s, [[Timothy Leary]] and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less supportive, and their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens [[suggestibility]], making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli.<ref name=Leary1963/> These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.<ref name=Berge1999/>\n\nAfter ingesting psilocybin, a wide range of subjective effects may be experienced: feelings of [[disorientation]], [[lethargy]], [[wiktionary:giddy|giddiness]], [[euphoria]], joy, and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. In one study 31% of volunteers who had been given a high dose reported feelings of significant fear and 17% experienced transient [[paranoia]].<ref name=Amsterdam2011/> In studies at [[Johns Hopkins]], among those given a moderate dose (but still enough to \u201cgive a high probability of a profound and beneficial experience\u201d) negative experiences were rare, whereas 1/3 of those given the high dose experienced anxiety or paranoia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/hallucinogenic_drug_psilocybin_eases_existential_anxiety_in_people_with_life_threatening_cancer_ |title= Hallucinogenic Drug Psilocybin Eases Existential Anxiety in People With Life-Threatening Cancer|publisher=Johns Hopkins |access-date=April 9, 2019|date = December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Hopkins2011\">{{cite journal |title= Psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences: Immediate and persisting dose-related effects|journal= Johns Hopkins |date =June 15, 2011 |pmc=3308357 |pmid=21674151 |doi=10.1007/s00213-011-2358-5 |volume=218 |issue= 4 |pages=649\u201365 |vauthors=Griffiths RR, Johnson MW, Richards WA, Richards BD, McCann U, Jesse R}}</ref> Low doses of the drug can induce hallucinatory effects.

Users having an unpleasant experience (a \"[[bad trip]]\") describe a reaction accompanied by fear, other unpleasant feelings, and occasionally by dangerous behavior. In general, the phrase \"bad trip\" is used to describe a reaction that is characterized primarily by fear or other unpleasant emotions, not just transitory experience of such feelings. A variety of factors may contribute to a psilocybin user experiencing a bad trip, including \"tripping\" during an emotional or physical low or in a non-supportive environment (see: ''[[set and setting]]''). Ingesting psilocybin in combination with other drugs, including alcohol, can also increase the likelihood of a bad trip.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/><ref name=Attema2007/> Other than the duration of the experience, the effects of psilocybin are similar to comparable dosages of LSD or mescaline. However, in the ''Psychedelics Encyclopedia'', author [[Peter Stafford]] noted, \"The psilocybin experience seems to be warmer, not as forceful and less isolating.

Reflecting the meaning of the word ''entheogen'' (\"the god within\"), the mushrooms are revered as powerful spiritual [[sacrament]]s that provide access to sacred worlds. Typically used in small group community settings, they enhance [[group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] and reaffirm traditional values.<ref name=Winkelman2007/> [[Terence McKenna]] documented the worldwide practices of psilocybin mushroom usage as part of a cultural [[ethos]] relating to the Earth and mysteries of nature, and suggested that mushrooms enhanced [[self-awareness]] and a sense of contact with a \"Transcendent Other\"\u2014reflecting a deeper understanding of our connectedness with nature.<ref name=McKenna1992/>\n\nPsychedelic drugs can induce states of [[consciousness]] that have lasting personal meaning and spiritual significance in individuals who are religious or spiritually inclined; these states are called [[mystical experience]]s. Some scholars have proposed that many of the qualities of a drug-induced mystical experience are indistinguishable from mystical experiences achieved through [[Religious experience#Causes of religious experiences|non-drug techniques]], such as [[meditation]] or [[holotropic breathwork]].<ref name=James1997/><ref name=Metzner1998/> In the 1960s, [[Walter Pahnke]] and colleagues systematically evaluated mystical experiences (which they called \"mystical consciousness\") by categorizing their common features. These categories, according to Pahnke, \"describe the core of a universal psychological experience, free from culturally determined philosophical or theological interpretations\", and allow researchers to assess mystical experiences on a qualitative, numerical scale.<ref name=Pahnke1969/>\n\nIn the 1962 [[Marsh Chapel Experiment]], which was run by Pahnke at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] under the supervision of Timothy Leary,<ref name=Pahnke1966/> almost all of the graduate degree [[seminary|divinity]] student volunteers who received psilocybin reported profound religious experiences.<ref name=Griffiths2008/> One of the participants was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]; he later described his experience as \"the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced.\"<ref name=Smith2000/> In a 25-year followup to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of \"a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life\".<ref>Doblin (1991), p. 13.</ref> Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered the study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, he said that the study cast \"a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects\".<ref>Doblin (1991), p. 24.</ref> This sentiment was echoed by psychiatrist William A.

The degree of mystical experience was measured using a questionnaire developed by Ralph W. Hood;<ref name=Hood1975/> 61% of subjects reported a \"complete mystical experience\" after their psilocybin session, while only 13% reported such an outcome after their experience with methylphenidate. Two months after taking psilocybin, 79% of the participants reported moderately to greatly increased [[life satisfaction]] and sense of well-being. About 36% of participants also had a strong to extreme \"experience of fear\" or [[dysphoria]] (i.e., a \"bad trip\") at some point during the psilocybin session (which was not reported by any subject during the methylphenidate session); about one-third of these (13% of the total) reported that this dysphoria dominated the entire session. These negative effects were reported to be easily managed by the researchers and did not have a lasting negative effect on the subject's sense of well-being.<ref name=\"urlMedical News: Psilocybin Viewed as Therapy or Research Tool - in Psychiatry, Addictions from MedPage Today\"/>\n\nA follow-up study conducted 14 months after the original psilocybin session confirmed that participants continued to attribute deep personal meaning to the experience. Almost one-third of the subjects reported that the experience was the single most meaningful or spiritually significant event of their lives, and over two-thirds reported it among their five most spiritually significant events. About two-thirds indicated that the experience increased their sense of well-being or life satisfaction.<ref name=Griffiths2008/> Even after 14 months, those who reported mystical experiences scored on average 4 percentage points higher on the personality trait of [[Openness to experience|Openness/Intellect]]; personality traits are normally stable across the lifespan for adults. Likewise, in a recent (2010) web-based questionnaire study designed to investigate user perceptions of the benefits and harms of hallucinogenic drug use, 60% of the 503 psilocybin users reported that their use of psilocybin had a long-term positive impact on their sense of well-being.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/><ref name=CarhartHarris2010/>\n\nWhile many recent studies have concluded that psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance, not all the medical community is on board.  [[Paul R. McHugh]], formerly director of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at [[Johns Hopkins]], responded as follows in a book review: \"The unmentioned fact in ''The Harvard Psychedelic Club'' is that LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and the like produce not a \u201chigher consciousness\u201d but rather a particular kind of \u201clower consciousness\u201d known well to psychiatrists and neurologists\u2014namely, \u201c[[Toxicity|toxic]] [[delirium]].\u201d\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/the-harvard-psychedelic-club-by-don-lattin/ |title= Paul McHugh reviews Don Lattin's \"The Harvard Psychedelic Club.\" |publisher=commentarymagazine.com |access-date=April 10, 2019|date = April 1, 2010}}</ref>  In response to Dr. McHugh\u2019s denial that the mystical experience leads to insight, Michael Pollan points to Roland Griffiths, Johns Hopkins researcher and author of many studies finding that the experiences of many of the participants have actually involved substantial and sustained personal meaning bringing enduring positive changes in psychological functioning.<ref name=Griffiths2017/><ref name=Griffiths2006/> According to Pollan, Griffiths admits that those taking psilocybin may be encountering a temporary psychosis, but notes that the patients McHugh describes are unlikely to report years later of their experience:  \"Wow, that was one of the greatest and most meaningful experiences of my life\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trippingly.net/lsd-studies/2018/5/15/how-to-change-your-mind |title=How to Change Your Mind |publisher=www.trippingly.net |access-date=April 22, 2019|date =February 1, 2019 }}</ref> Such responses argue that it is not appropriate to automatically equate a psilocybin-induced experience of profound insight with superficially similar experiences of psychiatric patients (characterized as mere toxic delirium), when it is only the \u201cinsight\u201d reached in the psilocybin experience that is reported to often result in profound, beneficial and enduring life changes for the person.\n\nIn 2011, Griffiths and colleagues published the results of further studies designed to learn more about the optimum psilocybin doses needed for positive life-changing experiences, while minimizing the chance of negative reactions. In a 14-month followup, the researchers found that 94% of the volunteers rated their experiences with the drug as one of the top five most spiritually significant of their lives (44% said it was the single most significant). None of the 90 sessions that took place throughout the study were rated as decreasing well-being or life satisfaction. Moreover, 89% reported positive changes in their behaviors as a result of the experiences. The conditions of the experimental design included a single drug experience a month, on a couch, in a living-room-like setting, with eye shades and carefully chosen music (classical and world music). As an additional precaution to guide the experience, as with the 2006 study, the 2011 study included a \"monitor\" or \"guide\" whom the volunteers supposedly trusted. The monitors provided gentle reassurance when the volunteers experienced anxiety. The volunteers and monitors all remained [[blind experiment|blind]] to the exact dosages for the purpose of the experiment.<ref name=Griffiths2011/>\n\n===Available forms===\nAlthough psilocybin may be prepared synthetically, outside of the research setting it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a [[herbal tea]], or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste.<ref name=EMCDDA/> In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts [[intravenous]]ly.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/>\n\n==Adverse effects==\n\nMost of the comparatively few fatal incidents reported in the literature that are associated with psychedelic mushroom usage involve the simultaneous use of other drugs, especially [[ethanol|alcohol]]. Probably the most common cause of hospital admissions resulting from psychedelic mushroom usage involve \"bad trips\" or [[panic attack|panic reactions]], in which affected individuals become extremely anxious, confused, agitated, or disoriented.

In the United States, laws were passed in 1966 that prohibited the production, trade, or ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs; Sandoz stopped producing LSD and psilocybin the same year.<ref name=Matsushima2009/> Further backlash against LSD usage swept psilocybin along with it into the [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule_I_controlled_substances|Schedule&nbsp;I category]] of illicit drugs in 1970.
