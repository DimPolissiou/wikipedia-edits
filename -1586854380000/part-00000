European Economic Community Regulations (EEC) No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R1208:19910429:EN:PDF 1208/81] and No. [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1981R2930:19910730:EN:PDF 2930/81] were enacted to facilitate the application of a community scale for the classification of carcasses of adult bovine animals. This was to ensure the uniform classification of the carcasses of adult bovine animals in the EEC and make the definitions of conformation classes and fat classes more precise. The need arose for a common grading scale when member states of the EEC began operating in the common beef market in 1968 (EEC) No. 805/68 and price reporting to the EC became mandatory.\n\nIn the UK, the Meat and Livestock Commission ([https://web.archive.org/web/20101127052714/http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/ MLC Services Ltd]) is responsible for the classification of over 80% of the cattle slaughtered in Britain. The EUROP grid consists of a 5-point scale in which each conformation and fat class is subdivided into low medium and high classes resulting in 15 classes. In the UK, the fat classes range from 1-5 with classes 4 and 5 having a high and low sub-class which results in a seven-point scale for fatness (figure 1). It is argued by the MLC that this subdivision allows a more precise description of the carcass.\n\nThe price a farmer receives for a beast sent for slaughter is calculated by multiplying the carcass weight by the classification price for a particular category of animal (heifer, steer, bull, cow etc.) This classification is subjectively assigned by the meat grader according to the EUROP system where E is excellent, U is Very Good, R is Good, O is Fair and P is Poor. Likewise for the fat class, where 1 is Low, 2 is Slight, 3 is Average, 4 is High, and 5 is Very High. A typical classification would be R4L where the R refers to a \"Good\u201d carcass with an \u201cAverage\u201d to \u201cHigh\u201d covering of fat according to the [http://www.mlcsl.co.uk/pdf/Beef%20Carcase%20Classification%2021Apr.pdf MLC].\n\nThe grader is usually an independent classifier who also monitors carcass dressing specification. Most classifiers are employed by MLC services and they are audited quarterly by the [[Rural Payments Agency|Rural Payments Agency (RPA)]] which is a government organisation. More recently Video [[Image analysis]] has been used to classify beef carcasses according to the EUROP scale.

The subspecies from [[South Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]] and [[Auckland Islands]] are similar but have a yellow band across the breast between the black head and white belly.

Fruit is taken during the winter and autumn. Most subspecies feed in vegetation, waiting on a perch and watching for [[prey]]. [[Insect]]s are also gleaned from branches and leaves.

The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M. (2006): A molecular phylogeny of New Zealand\u2019s Petroica (Aves: Petroicidae) species based on mitochondrial DNA sequences. ''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''40'''(3): 844-855.</ref>\n\nThere are five subspecies of the tomtit, with each subspecies being restricted to one of the following islands or island groups: North Island, South Island, the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands, and the Auckland Islands. Four of these five subspecies have been elevated to full species in the past (the Chatham subspecies was retained with the South Island tomtit),<ref>R.N. Holdaway, T.H. Worthy and A.J.D. Tennyson,(2001) \"A working list of breeding bird species of the New Zealand region at first human contact/\" ''NZ J. Zool.'' '''28''': pp. 119\u2013187</ref> but genetic studies have shown that these subspecies diverged relatively recently.<ref name = \"Miller\"/> The [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]] name of the North Island tomtit is '''miromiro''', while the South Island tomtit is known as '''ngirungiru'''.\n\n*North Island tomtit ''P. m. toitoi''\n*South Island tomtit  ''P. m. macrocephala''\n*[[Chatham tomtit]] ''P. m. chathamensis''\n*Auckland tomtit ''P. m. marrineri''\n*Snares tomtit ''P. m. dannefaerdi''\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Tomtit fem - New Zealand (25419832238).jpg|thumb|Female tomtits have a browner plumage than the males]]\nThe tomtit is a small (13&nbsp;cm, 11&nbsp;g) bird with a large head and a short [[beak|bill]]. The male [[North Island]] subspecies has black head, back, wings (with a white wing bar) and a white belly. The subspecies from [[South Island]], the [[Chatham Islands]] and [[Auckland Islands]] are similar but have a yellow band across the breast between the black head and white belly. The females are brown instead of black. The [[Snares Island]] subspecies is entirely black, and is known as the black tit.<ref name = \"Heather\">Heather, B & Robertson, H. (1996) ''The Field Guide to the Birds of New Zealand'' Auckland:Viking {{ISBN|0-14-302040-4}}</ref>\n\nThe island subspecies of tomtits show a striking variation in body size, being considerably larger than their mainland relatives, a tendency known as the [[Foster's rule|island rule]]. Birds from the main islands weigh around 11g, but birds from Snares Island weigh in at 20&nbsp;g.\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Bul01Bird239b.jpg|thumb|Illustration of South Island tomtit nests (1888)]]\n\nThe tomtit is mostly an [[insectivore]], feeding on small invertebrates such as [[beetle]]s, caterpillars, [[spider]]s, [[moth]]s, [[weta]], [[earthworm]]s and flies. Fruit is taken during the winter and autumn. Most subspecies feed in vegetation, waiting on a perch and watching for [[prey]]. [[Insect]]s are also gleaned from branches and leaves. The Snares subspecies feeds on the ground as well, in a similar fashion to the [[New Zealand robin (disambiguation)|New Zealand robin]].<ref name = \"Heather\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* {{Portal-inline|Birds}}\n* {{Portal-inline|New Zealand}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Petroica macrocephala}}\n* {{cite web |title = Chatham Island fantail, Chatham Island tomtit and Chatham Island warbler recovery plan 2001\u20132011 | url = http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/science-and-technical/TSRP46.pdf | year = 2001| publisher = Department of Conservation, Wellington, New Zealand | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-10-04}}\n\n{{Petroicidae}}\n{{Birds of New Zealand}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q139526}}\n\n[[Category:Birds described in 1789]]\n[[Category:Birds of New Zealand]]\n[[Category:Birds of the Chatham Islands]]\n[[Category:Petroica]]\n", "name_user": "Rogermccart", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomtit"}
