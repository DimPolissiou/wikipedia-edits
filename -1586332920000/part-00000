They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East division]]. The team have won nine [[World Series]] [[List of World Series champions|championships]], tied for the third-most of any MLB team, and they have played in 14. Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in {{wsy|2018}}. In addition, they won the {{mlby|1904}} American League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], but were not able to defend their [[1903 World Series]] championship when the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] refused to participate in the [[1904 World Series]]. Founded in {{mlby|1901}} as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since {{mlby|1912}}. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I. Taylor]], ''circa'' 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"'''[[Boston Red Stockings (disambiguation)|Boston Red Stockings]]'''\", including the forerunner of the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nThe Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in [[1903 World Series|1903]] and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, dubbed the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival [[New York Yankees]] two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in {{wsy|2004}}. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s \"[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|mad dash]]\" in {{wsy|1946}}, the \"[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]\" of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}.

''Sox'' had been previously adopted for the [[Chicago White Sox]] by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of ''Stockings'', as \"Stockings Win!\" in [[Large font|large type]] did not fit in a column.

Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]]<ref>From George V. Tuohey (1897). A History of the Boston Baseball Club: A concise and accurate history of Base Ball from its inception. Boston, Massachusetts: M. F. Quinn & Co. p. 64.</ref> to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the \"Red Stockings\" nickname along. (Most nicknames were then unofficial \u2014 neither club names nor registered trademarks \u2014 so the migration was informal.) The [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.\n\nWhen a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, the \"Red Stockings\" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the \"Red Caps\". Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname \"Braves\" in 1912; the club [[Boston Braves To Milwaukee|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In 1901, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \"Boston\", \"Bostonians\" or \"the Bostons\"; or the \"Americans\" or \"Boston Americans\" as in \"American Leaguers\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901\u20131907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read \"Boston\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \"B\" and \"A\" denoting \"Boston\" and \"American.\" Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including \"Somersets\" (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), \"Plymouth Rocks\", \"Beaneaters\", the \"Collinsites\" (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])\", and \"Pilgrims.\"\n\nFor years many sources have listed \"Pilgrims\" as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's follow-up article in ''The National Pastime''. Apparently this originated with a writer for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.]</ref> The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled \"The Pilgrims At Home\" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (\"Rory O'More\" melody).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm |title=The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist |publisher=Celebrateboston.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims \"sounded too much like homeless wanderers.\"\n\nThe National League club in Boston, though seldom called the \"Red Stockings\" anymore, still wore red trim. In 1907, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and remained the \"Red Sox\" for good.\n\nThe name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to \"Bosox\" or \"BoSox\", a combination of \"Boston\" and \"Sox\" (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|\"ChiSox\"]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Pawtucket Red Sox|\"PawSox\"]] of Pawtucket). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the ''Crimson Hose''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516201342/http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 16, 2016|title=Colin McEnroe at the Hartford Courant}}</ref> and ''the Olde Towne Team''. Recently, media have begun to call them the \"Sawx\" casually, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a [[New England English|New England accent]].

Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname \"Americans\". This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which did not adopt an official nickname until 1908.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans logo.png|thumb|170px|The Americans logo, 1901\u201307]]\nThe upstart league placed franchises in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he needed a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, [[George Brumder]] who sold the team one year later.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Milwaukee Sentinel |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cdcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FxIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6397%2C3613025 |website=news.google.com}}</ref> Playing their home games at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star [[third baseman]] [[Jimmy Collins]], outfielders [[Chick Stahl]], [[Buck Freeman]], and [[Patsy Dougherty]], and [[pitcher]] [[Cy Young]], who in 1901 won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 wins), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml|title=Cy Young Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|author=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> His 1901 to 1904 seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.\n\nIn 1903, [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston]] participated in the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], going up against the [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6{{sfrac|1|2}} games. Aided by the modified chants of \"[[Tessie]]\" by the [[Royal Rooters]] [[fan club]] and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.\n\n[[File:WorldSeries1903-640.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of the Huntington Avenue Grounds before the first modern World Series game]]\nThe [[1904 Boston Americans season|1904 club]] was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the [[1904 New York Highlanders season|New York Highlanders]], the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for [[Bob Unglaub]]. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, [[Hilltop Park]]. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With [[Jack Chesbro]], the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2\u20132 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and [[Lou Criger]] scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.\n\n[[File:Huntington Avenue Grounds.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Huntington Avenue Grounds during a game. Note building from which the famous 1903 \"bird's-eye\" photo was taken.]]\nThe NL champion [[1904 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] declined to play any [[1904 World Series|postseason series]], fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905. These successful times soon ended, however, as [[1906 Boston Americans season|Boston]] lost 100 games in 1906. However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans season pass, 1906.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A season pass for the 1906 season.]]\nBy 1909, [[center fielder]] [[Tris Speaker]] had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox did not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 [[1912 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Their .691 [[winning percentage]] in 1912 still stands as the best in team history, and their 105 wins stood as the club record for 106-years, until the 2018 club won 108. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game\u2014Tris Speaker, [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]]\u2014and superstar pitcher [[Smoky Joe Wood]], the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4\u20133\u20131 in the classic [[1912 World Series]] best known for [[Snodgrass's Muff]]. From 1913 to 1916 the Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]], who signed [[Babe Ruth]], soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in 1915 propelled the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] to the [[1915 World Series]], where they beat the [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] four games to one. Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The [[1916 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] went on to win the [[1916 World Series]], this time defeating the [[Brooklyn Robins]]. In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another [[1918 World Series|World Series]] championship, this time over the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].\n\n===Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920\u20131938)===\n[[File:1915 Babe Ruth.jpeg|thumb|right|Babe Ruth in 1915]]\n[[Harry Frazee]] bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder [[Duffy Lewis]], pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/l/leonadu01.shtml|title=Dutch Leonard Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>), and pitcher [[Ernie Shore]] were traded to the Yankees for pitcher [[Ray Caldwell]], [[Slim Love]], [[Roxy Walters]], [[Frank Gilhooley]] and $15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lewis_Duffy.stm |title=Duffy Lewis |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> As all three players were well regarded in Boston\u2014Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard only four years before had set a modern record for earned run average\u2014this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star [[Carl Mays]] was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/M/Mays_Carl.stm |title=Carl Mays |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Mays had several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.\n\nOn December 26, 1919,<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=31}}</ref> Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_leagues.shtml |title=Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records for Home Runs \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref>) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] play ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Montville|first=Leigh|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |pages=161\u201364|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}</ref> ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919. ''My Lady Friends'' had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.\n\nDuring that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] had a d\u00e9tente; they were called \"Insurrectos\" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920). Further, providing the Yankees with a [[box office]] attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and \"the Loyal Five\" clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0718/1407265.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB \u2014 When the Yankees nearly moved to Boston |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.\n\nNew York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry]], considered the \"Greatest Rivalry on Earth\" by American sports journalists.<ref name=\"FierceRivalry\"/>\n\nAfter deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, [[Wally Schang]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]] and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for [[Del Pratt]], [[Muddy Ruel]], John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Schang_Wally.stm |title=Wally Schang&#124;BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> The [[1921 in baseball|following winter]], iron man [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]], and pitchers [[Bullet Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones]] were traded to the Yankees for [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] (who was immediately shipped to the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]), [[Jack Quinn (baseball)|Jack Quinn]], [[Rip Collins (pitcher)|Rip Collins]], Bill Piercy and $50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Scott_Everett.stm |title=Everett Scott &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> On July 23, 1922, [[Joe Dugan]] and [[Elmer Smith (baseball outfielder, born 1892)|Elmer Smith]] were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, [[Johnny Mitchell (baseball)|Johnny Mitchell]], and [[Lefty O'Doul]], who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]] in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Smith_Elmer309.stm |title=Elmer Smith &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of [[Herb Pennock]], occurring in early 1923.

During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] in 1923. During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43\u2013111, still the worst record in franchise history. One of the few bright spots on these teams was [[Earl Webb]], who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67. The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when [[Tom Yawkey]] bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher [[Wes Ferrell]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, [[Lefty Grove]], making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired [[Joe Cronin]], an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging [[first baseman]] [[Jimmie Foxx]] whose 50 home runs in 1938 stood as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/foxxji01.shtml|title=Jimmie Foxx Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com |author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131960: The Ted Williams Era===\n[[File:Ted Williams 1954 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ted Williams]]\nIn 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] [[Ted Williams]] from the minor league [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the \"Ted Sox.\" Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called \"Williamsburg.\" Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both World War II and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml |title=Ted Williams Statistics \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them \"The Knights of the Keyboard\", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.\n\nWith Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]], but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the \"Williams Shift\", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.\n\nThe Cardinals won the 1946 Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or \"held the ball\" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.\n\nAlong with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).\n\nThe Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In 1949, the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.\n\nThe 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup \"Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.\" [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however, owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, [[Frank Malzone]] debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the 1960 [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story \"Hub fans bid Kid adieu.\" The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm team]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s: Yaz and the Impossible Dream===\n{{Main|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}\n<!--No Source Information: [[File:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]]-->\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.\n\nRed Sox fans know 1967 as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the \"Impossible Dream.\" The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] \"[[Man of La Mancha]]\". 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the 1966 [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the [[1967 World Series]].  Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 [[runs batted in]]. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[C\u00e9sar Tovar]] first on his ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> But the Red Sox lost the series to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. Cardinals pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] stymied the Red Sox, winning three games.\n\n[[File:Red_Sox_Bullpen_Cart_(7224550882).jpg|right|thumb|The [[bullpen car]] used by the Red Sox]]\nAn 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named [[Tony Conigliaro]] slugged 24 home runs in 1964. \"Tony C\" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. He was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.\n\n===1970s: The Red Hat Era===\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.\n\n====1975====\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill \"The Spaceman\" Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Awards & Rolaids Relief Award Winners \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"oezowb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml |title=Most Valuable Player MVP Awards & Cy Young Awards Winners \u2013 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].\n\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Carlton Fisk]], best known for his \"waving fair\" home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series]]\nIn the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the 11th inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled off [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.\n\nThe Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\"\n\n====1978 pennant race====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were {{frac|14|1|2}} [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as \"The Boston Massacre\"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.\n\nOn September 16 the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.\n\nThe most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=145\u2013147}}</ref> The dejected Boston manager, [[Don Zimmer]], gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: \"Bucky F**king Dent!\" [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third.

The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|work= }}</ref> to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in 1971.<ref name=\"oezowb\" /> Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander [[Bruce Hurst]] went 13\u20138, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] from the 1960s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\nThe [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6\u20135. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.\n\nThe Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN.com: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3\u20133. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].\n\nAfter recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and [[Bruce Hurst]] as Most Valuable Player of the World Series. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.\n\nWhile Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.\n\nMany observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were \"cursed.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref>\n\nThis World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.<ref name=\"Gorman\"/> Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.<ref name=\"Gorman\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html|title=Lou Gorman, Whose Red Sox Lost to Mets, Dies at 82|date=April 2, 2011|first=Bruce|last=Weber|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B8}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Morgan Magic===\nThe [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in 1988.

The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland.

Prior to the start of the 1998 [[1998 Major League Baseball season|season]], the Red Sox dealt pitchers [[Tony Armas, Jr.]] and [[Carl Pavano]] to the [[Montreal Expos]] for pitcher [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]]. Mart\u00ednez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|team]] won the American League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]], but again lost the [[1998 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] to the [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]].\n\nIn 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park \"economically obsolete\" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.\n\nOn the field, the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|1999 Red Sox]] were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] took a 2\u20130 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and his brother [[Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez]]. Game 4's 23\u20137 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5\u20132 lead after two innings, but Pedro Mart\u00ednez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12\u20138 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder [[Troy O'Leary]]. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.\n\n===2002\u2013present: John Henry era===\n====2002\u201303====\n{{Main|2002 Boston Red Sox season|2003 Boston Red Sox season}}\nIn 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to [[New England Sports Ventures]], a consortium headed by principal owner [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]]. [[Tom Werner]] served as executive chairman, [[Larry Lucchino]] served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was [[Les Otten]]. [[Dan Duquette]] was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM [[Mike Port]] taking the helm for the 2002 season. A week later, manager [[Joe Kerrigan]] was fired and was replaced by [[Grady Little]].\n\nWhile nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]], the new ownership made additions such as outfielder [[Cliff Floyd]] and relief pitcher [[Alan Embree]]. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ram\u00edrez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Mart\u00ednez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games\u2014becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.\n\nAfter failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by [[Yale University]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]]. Epstein, raised in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.\n\n[[File:2003-09-25 - Fenway Park 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Sox celebrate their clinching of the 2003 AL Wild Card with a victory over the [[2003 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]]]]\nThe [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|2003 team]] was known as the \"Cowboy Up\" team, a nickname derived from first baseman [[Kevin Millar]]'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.<ref name=\"Cowboyup\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/09/24/rallying_cry_spurs_sox_to_finish_ride/|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 24, 2003|title=Rallying Cry Spurs Sox To Finish Ride|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}</ref> In the [[2003 American League Division Series]], the Red Sox rallied from a 0\u20132 series deficit against the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] to win the best-of-five series.

In Game 7, Boston led 5\u20132 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Mart\u00ednez allowed three runs to tie the game. The Red Sox could not score off [[Mariano Rivera]] over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6\u20135 when Yankee third baseman [[Aaron Boone]] hit a solo home run off of [[Tim Wakefield]].

Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] manager [[Terry Francona]].\n\n====\"The Idiots\": 2004 World Series Championship====\n{{Main|2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 World Series}}\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], and received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]], and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as \"the Idiots\", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed \"curse.\"\n\nBoston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19\u20138 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with [[Mariano Rivera]] in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by [[Bill Mueller]], sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game 6\u20134 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning. The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series deciding Game 7 after trailing 3\u20130 in games. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10\u20133 victory over the Yankees. Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer. Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American professional sports]] teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3\u20130. (The [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Los Angeles Kings]] would later accomplish the feat).\n\nThe Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; [[Mark Bellhorn]] hit a game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]] in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and [[Derek Lowe]]. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ram\u00edrez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[October 2004 lunar eclipse|total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].\n\n====2007: World Series Championship====\n{{Main|2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007 World Series}}\n[[File:Redsoxpitchers.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pitchers (left\u2013right) [[Josh Beckett]], Jon Lester, [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]], pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]] and [[Curt Schilling]], prior to a Red Sox game at Seattle in August 2007]]\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]\nThe 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs. In 2006 [[David Ortiz]] broke [[Jimmie Foxx]]'s single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to several injuries in club's roster.\n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.\n\nThe Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager [[Terry Francona]] refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|AL Rookie of the Year Award]] for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, [[Josh Beckett]] emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]] all struggled at times. Relief pitcher [[Hideki Okajima]], another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a [[no-hitter]] in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.\n\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Victorious Red Sox players being honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W.

Facing the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30\u20135 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]], and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered [[Jon Lester]], who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5{{sfrac|2|3}} shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] and pinch-hitter [[Bobby Kielty]] secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.\n\n====2008\u20132012: Injuries and Collapses====\nThe Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7\u20130. Down the stretch, outfielder [[Manny Ramirez]] became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card.

The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

In 2010 they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs. In 2011 the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season#Collapse|Red Sox collapsed]], becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, as they went 7\u201320 in the final month and failed again to make the playoffs. In December 2011, [[Bobby Valentine]] was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of [[Fenway Park]], and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. They finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.\n\n[[File:Massachusetts State House Red Sox Banner.JPG|thumb|The [[Massachusetts State House]] displaying a banner in honor of the Red Sox's [[2013 World Series]] appearance]]\n\n====Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions====\n{{main|2013 Boston Red Sox season|2013 World Series}}\nBoston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69\u201393 record in 2012\u201326 games behind the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L.

These acquisitions included veteran catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Mike Napoli]], and [[Shane Victorino]]. While some questioned these players as \"re-treads\", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in \"clubhouse players\". Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran [[John Lackey]] coming off [[Tommy John surgery]] and both Jon Lester and [[Clay Buchholz]] returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both [[closer (baseball)|closers]], [[Joel Hanrahan]] and [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]], went down early with season-ending injuries.

And nobody is going to dictate our freedom!

The team also hung up in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] a custom jersey that read \"Boston Strong\" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's [[area code]].

They compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[American League]] (AL) [[American League East|East division]]. The team have won nine [[World Series]] [[List of World Series champions|championships]], tied for the third-most of any MLB team, and they have played in 14. Their most recent World Series appearance and win was in {{wsy|2018}}. In addition, they won the {{mlby|1904}} American League [[pennant (sports)|pennant]], but were not able to defend their [[1903 World Series]] championship when the [[History of the New York Giants (baseball)|New York Giants]] refused to participate in the [[1904 World Series]]. Founded in {{mlby|1901}} as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox' home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since {{mlby|1912}}. The \"Red Sox\" name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I. Taylor]], ''circa'' 1908, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the \"'''[[Boston Red Stockings (disambiguation)|Boston Red Stockings]]'''\", including the forerunner of the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nThe Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in [[1903 World Series|1903]] and winning four more championships by 1918. However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, dubbed the \"[[Curse of the Bambino]]\" after its alleged inception due to the Red Sox' sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival [[New York Yankees]] two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in {{wsy|2004}}. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s \"[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|mad dash]]\" in {{wsy|1946}}, the \"[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]\" of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}. Following their victory in the [[2018 World Series]], they became the first team to win four [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|World Series trophies]] in the 21st century, with championships in {{wsy|2004}}, {{wsy|2007}}, {{wsy|2013}} and {{wsy|2018}}.

The official Spanish site uses the variant \"Los Red Sox\".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe Red Stockings nickname was first used by a baseball team by the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings (AA)|Cincinnati Red Stockings]], who were members of the pioneering [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]]<ref>From George V. Tuohey (1897). A History of the Boston Baseball Club: A concise and accurate history of Base Ball from its inception. Boston, Massachusetts: M. F. Quinn & Co. p. 64.</ref> to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the \"Red Stockings\" nickname along. (Most nicknames were then unofficial \u2014 neither club names nor registered trademarks \u2014 so the migration was informal.) The [[History of the Boston Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.\n\nWhen a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, the \"Red Stockings\" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the \"Red Caps\". Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname \"Braves\" in 1912; the club [[Boston Braves To Milwaukee|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].\n\n[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In 1901, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply \"Boston\", \"Bostonians\" or \"the Bostons\"; or the \"Americans\" or \"Boston Americans\" as in \"American Leaguers\", Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901\u20131907 jerseys, both home, and road, just read \"Boston\", except for 1902 when they sported large letters \"B\" and \"A\" denoting \"Boston\" and \"American.\" Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including \"Somersets\" (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), \"Plymouth Rocks\", \"Beaneaters\", the \"Collinsites\" (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])\", and \"Pilgrims.\"\n\nFor years many sources have listed \"Pilgrims\" as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.<ref>[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's follow-up article in ''The National Pastime''. Apparently this originated with a writer for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.]</ref> The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled \"The Pilgrims At Home\" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (\"Rory O'More\" melody).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm |title=The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist |publisher=Celebrateboston.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims \"sounded too much like homeless wanderers.\"\n\nThe National League club in Boston, though seldom called the \"Red Stockings\" anymore, still wore red trim. In 1907, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and remained the \"Red Sox\" for good.\n\nThe name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to \"Bosox\" or \"BoSox\", a combination of \"Boston\" and \"Sox\" (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|\"ChiSox\"]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Pawtucket Red Sox|\"PawSox\"]] of Pawtucket).

Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname \"Americans\". This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which did not adopt an official nickname until 1908.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans logo.png|thumb|170px|The Americans logo, 1901\u201307]]\nThe upstart league placed franchises in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he needed a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, [[George Brumder]] who sold the team one year later.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Milwaukee Sentinel |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cdcVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FxIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6397%2C3613025 |website=news.google.com}}</ref> Playing their home games at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star [[third baseman]] [[Jimmy Collins]], outfielders [[Chick Stahl]], [[Buck Freeman]], and [[Patsy Dougherty]], and [[pitcher]] [[Cy Young]], who in 1901 won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 wins), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml|title=Cy Young Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|author=Baseball-Reference.com}}</ref> His 1901 to 1904 seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.\n\nIn 1903, [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston]] participated in the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], going up against the [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6{{sfrac|1|2}} games. Aided by the modified chants of \"[[Tessie]]\" by the [[Royal Rooters]] [[fan club]] and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.\n\n[[File:WorldSeries1903-640.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of the Huntington Avenue Grounds before the first modern World Series game]]\nThe [[1904 Boston Americans season|1904 club]] was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the [[1904 New York Highlanders season|New York Highlanders]], the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for [[Bob Unglaub]]. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, [[Hilltop Park]]. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With [[Jack Chesbro]], the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2\u20132 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and [[Lou Criger]] scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.\n\n[[File:Huntington Avenue Grounds.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Huntington Avenue Grounds during a game. Note building from which the famous 1903 \"bird's-eye\" photo was taken.]]\nThe NL champion [[1904 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] declined to play any [[1904 World Series|postseason series]], fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905. These successful times soon ended, however, as [[1906 Boston Americans season|Boston]] lost 100 games in 1906. However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.\n\n[[File:Boston Americans season pass, 1906.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A season pass for the 1906 season.]]\nBy 1909, [[center fielder]] [[Tris Speaker]] had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox did not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 [[1912 Major League Baseball season|season]]. Their .691 [[winning percentage]] in 1912 still stands as the best in team history, and their 105 wins stood as the club record for 106-years, until the 2018 club won 108. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game\u2014Tris Speaker, [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]]\u2014and superstar pitcher [[Smoky Joe Wood]], the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4\u20133\u20131 in the classic [[1912 World Series]] best known for [[Snodgrass's Muff]]. From 1913 to 1916 the Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]], who signed [[Babe Ruth]], soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in 1915 propelled the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] to the [[1915 World Series]], where they beat the [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] four games to one. Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The [[1916 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] went on to win the [[1916 World Series]], this time defeating the [[Brooklyn Robins]]. In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another [[1918 World Series|World Series]] championship, this time over the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].\n\n===Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920\u20131938)===\n[[File:1915 Babe Ruth.jpeg|thumb|right|Babe Ruth in 1915]]\n[[Harry Frazee]] bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder [[Duffy Lewis]], pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/l/leonadu01.shtml|title=Dutch Leonard Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>), and pitcher [[Ernie Shore]] were traded to the Yankees for pitcher [[Ray Caldwell]], [[Slim Love]], [[Roxy Walters]], [[Frank Gilhooley]] and $15,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lewis_Duffy.stm |title=Duffy Lewis |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> As all three players were well regarded in Boston\u2014Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard only four years before had set a modern record for earned run average\u2014this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star [[Carl Mays]] was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/M/Mays_Carl.stm |title=Carl Mays |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Mays had several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.\n\nOn December 26, 1919,<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=31}}</ref> Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_leagues.shtml |title=Year-by-Year League Leaders & Records for Home Runs \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref>) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] play ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Montville|first=Leigh|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |pages=161\u201364|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}</ref> ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919. ''My Lady Friends'' had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.\n\nDuring that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] had a d\u00e9tente; they were called \"Insurrectos\" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920). Further, providing the Yankees with a [[box office]] attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and \"the Loyal Five\" clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0718/1407265.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB \u2014 When the Yankees nearly moved to Boston |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.\n\nNew York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the [[Yankees\u2013Red Sox rivalry]], considered the \"Greatest Rivalry on Earth\" by American sports journalists.<ref name=\"FierceRivalry\"/>\n\nAfter deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, [[Wally Schang]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]] and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for [[Del Pratt]], [[Muddy Ruel]], John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Schang_Wally.stm |title=Wally Schang&#124;BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> The [[1921 in baseball|following winter]], iron man [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]], and pitchers [[Bullet Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones]] were traded to the Yankees for [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] (who was immediately shipped to the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]]), [[Jack Quinn (baseball)|Jack Quinn]], [[Rip Collins (pitcher)|Rip Collins]], Bill Piercy and $50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Scott_Everett.stm |title=Everett Scott &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> On July 23, 1922, [[Joe Dugan]] and [[Elmer Smith (baseball outfielder, born 1892)|Elmer Smith]] were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, [[Johnny Mitchell (baseball)|Johnny Mitchell]], and [[Lefty O'Doul]], who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]] in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Smith_Elmer309.stm |title=Elmer Smith &#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of [[Herb Pennock]], occurring in early 1923. Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, [[George Murray (baseball)|George Murray]] and $50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/p/pennohe01.shtml#TRANS |title=Herb Pennock Statistics \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades. During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] in 1923. During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43\u2013111, still the worst record in franchise history. One of the few bright spots on these teams was [[Earl Webb]], who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67. The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when [[Tom Yawkey]] bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher [[Wes Ferrell]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, [[Lefty Grove]], making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired [[Joe Cronin]], an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging [[first baseman]] [[Jimmie Foxx]] whose 50 home runs in 1938 stood as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/f/foxxji01.shtml|title=Jimmie Foxx Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com |author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\n===1939\u20131960: The Ted Williams Era===\n[[File:Ted Williams 1954 Bowman.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Ted Williams]]\nIn 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] [[Ted Williams]] from the minor league [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the \"Ted Sox.\" Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called \"Williamsburg.\" Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both World War II and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml |title=Ted Williams Statistics \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them \"The Knights of the Keyboard\", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.\n\nWith Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]], but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the \"Williams Shift\", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.\n\nThe Cardinals won the 1946 Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or \"held the ball\" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.\n\nAlong with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).\n\nThe Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949. In 1948, [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In 1949, the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.\n\nThe 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup \"Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.\" [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however, owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. In 1955, [[Frank Malzone]] debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the 1960 [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story \"Hub fans bid Kid adieu.\" The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm team]] in 1959.\n\n===1960s: Yaz and the Impossible Dream===\n{{Main|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}\n<!--No Source Information: [[File:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]]-->\nThe 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.\n\nRed Sox fans know 1967 as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the \"Impossible Dream.\" The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] \"[[Man of La Mancha]]\". 1967 saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the 1966 [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the [[1967 World Series]].  Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 [[runs batted in]]. He was named the league's Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[C\u00e9sar Tovar]] first on his ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}</ref> But the Red Sox lost the series to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. Cardinals pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] stymied the Red Sox, winning three games.\n\n[[File:Red_Sox_Bullpen_Cart_(7224550882).jpg|right|thumb|The [[bullpen car]] used by the Red Sox]]\nAn 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named [[Tony Conigliaro]] slugged 24 home runs in 1964. \"Tony C\" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. He was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same.\n\n===1970s: The Red Hat Era===\nAlthough the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.\n\n====1975====\nThe Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill \"The Spaceman\" Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Awards & Rolaids Relief Award Winners \u2014 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"oezowb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml |title=Most Valuable Player MVP Awards & Cy Young Awards Winners \u2013 |website=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=October 31, 2013}}</ref> In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].\n\n[[File:Carlton Fisk 1976.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Carlton Fisk]], best known for his \"waving fair\" home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series]]\nIn the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6\u20133 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the 11th inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled off [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the 12th inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7\u20136.\n\nThe Red Sox lost game 7, 4\u20133 even though they had an early 3\u20130 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\"\n\n====1978 pennant race====\nIn 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were {{frac|14|1|2}} [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as \"The Boston Massacre\"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.\n\nOn September 16 the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one\u2014with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9\u20132 and Boston won 5\u20130, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.\n\nThe most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=145\u2013147}}</ref> The dejected Boston manager, [[Don Zimmer]], gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: \"Bucky F**king Dent!\" [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5\u20134 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third.

The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24\u20134 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics&nbsp;\u2014 Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|work= }}</ref> to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in 1971.<ref name=\"oezowb\" /> Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander [[Bruce Hurst]] went 13\u20138, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games. Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to [[Don Drysdale]] and [[Sandy Koufax]] from the 1960s [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].\n\nThe [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3\u20131 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5\u20132 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6\u20135. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.\n\nThe Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3\u20132 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN.com: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3\u20133. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5\u20133 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].\n\nAfter recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and [[Bruce Hurst]] as Most Valuable Player of the World Series. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley (baseball)|Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.\n\nWhile Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers\u2014as well as both Wilson and Buckner\u2014have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.\n\nMany observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3\u20130, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were \"cursed.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}</ref>\n\nThis World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.<ref name=\"Gorman\"/> Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.<ref name=\"Gorman\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html|title=Lou Gorman, Whose Red Sox Lost to Mets, Dies at 82|date=April 2, 2011|first=Bruce|last=Weber|newspaper=The New York Times|page=B8}}</ref>\n\n===1988\u20131991: Morgan Magic===\nThe [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in 1988.

The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in 1990, the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] again won the division and face the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] in the [[1990 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

However, they were swept in three games in the [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] by the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.\n\nRoger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 [[1996 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 18, 1996 in one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform. After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993\u201396, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering \"the twilight of his career\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&id=2124180&action=login&appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fmlb%2fcolumns%2fstory%3fcolumnist%3dcrasnick_jerry%26id%3d2124180%26CMP%3dOTC-DT9705204233 |title=Clemens putting Cooperstown on hold}}</ref> Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards.\n\nOut of contention in 1997, the team traded closer [[Heathcliff Slocumb]] to Seattle for catching prospect [[Jason Varitek]] and right-handed pitcher [[Derek Lowe]]. Prior to the start of the 1998 [[1998 Major League Baseball season|season]], the Red Sox dealt pitchers [[Tony Armas, Jr.]] and [[Carl Pavano]] to the [[Montreal Expos]] for pitcher [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]]. Mart\u00ednez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|team]] won the American League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]], but again lost the [[1998 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] to the [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]].\n\nIn 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park \"economically obsolete\" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.\n\nOn the field, the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|1999 Red Sox]] were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] took a 2\u20130 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Mart\u00ednez and his brother [[Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez (pitcher)|Ram\u00f3n Mart\u00ednez]]. Game 4's 23\u20137 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5\u20132 lead after two innings, but Pedro Mart\u00ednez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12\u20138 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder [[Troy O'Leary]]. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.\n\n===2002\u2013present: John Henry era===\n====2002\u201303====\n{{Main|2002 Boston Red Sox season|2003 Boston Red Sox season}}\nIn 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to [[New England Sports Ventures]], a consortium headed by principal owner [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]]. [[Tom Werner]] served as executive chairman, [[Larry Lucchino]] served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was [[Les Otten]]. [[Dan Duquette]] was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM [[Mike Port]] taking the helm for the 2002 season. A week later, manager [[Joe Kerrigan]] was fired and was replaced by [[Grady Little]].\n\nWhile nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]], the new ownership made additions such as outfielder [[Cliff Floyd]] and relief pitcher [[Alan Embree]]. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ram\u00edrez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Mart\u00ednez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games\u2014becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.\n\nAfter failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by [[Yale University]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]]. Epstein, raised in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.\n\n[[File:2003-09-25 - Fenway Park 11.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Sox celebrate their clinching of the 2003 AL Wild Card with a victory over the [[2003 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]]]]\nThe [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|2003 team]] was known as the \"Cowboy Up\" team, a nickname derived from first baseman [[Kevin Millar]]'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.<ref name=\"Cowboyup\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/09/24/rallying_cry_spurs_sox_to_finish_ride/|work=The Boston Globe|date=September 24, 2003|title=Rallying Cry Spurs Sox To Finish Ride|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}</ref> In the [[2003 American League Division Series]], the Red Sox rallied from a 0\u20132 series deficit against the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] to win the best-of-five series.

Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] manager [[Terry Francona]].\n\n====\"The Idiots\": 2004 World Series Championship====\n{{Main|2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 World Series}}\nDuring the 2003\u201304 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], and received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]], and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as \"the Idiots\", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed \"curse.\"\n\nBoston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19\u20138 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4\u20133 in the ninth with [[Mariano Rivera]] in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by [[Bill Mueller]], sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game 6\u20134 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning. The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series deciding Game 7 after trailing 3\u20130 in games. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10\u20133 victory over the Yankees. Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer. Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941\u201342 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1974\u201375 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|North American professional sports]] teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3\u20130. (The [[2009\u201310 Philadelphia Flyers season|2010 Philadelphia Flyers]] and the [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Kings season|2014 Los Angeles Kings]] would later accomplish the feat).\n\nThe Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; [[Mark Bellhorn]] hit a game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]] in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and [[Derek Lowe]]. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ram\u00edrez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[October 2004 lunar eclipse|total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].\n\n====2007: World Series Championship====\n{{Main|2007 Boston Red Sox season|2007 World Series}}\n[[File:Redsoxpitchers.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Pitchers (left\u2013right) [[Josh Beckett]], Jon Lester, [[\u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9]], pitching coach [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]] and [[Curt Schilling]], prior to a Red Sox game at Seattle in August 2007]]\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]\nThe 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95\u201367. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs. In 2006 [[David Ortiz]] broke [[Jimmie Foxx]]'s single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9\u201321 record in the month of August due to several injuries in club's roster.\n\nTheo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.\n\nThe Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager [[Terry Francona]] refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|AL Rookie of the Year Award]] for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, [[Josh Beckett]] emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and [[Juli\u00e1n Tav\u00e1rez]] all struggled at times. Relief pitcher [[Hideki Okajima]], another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a [[no-hitter]] in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.\n\n[[File:Boston Red Sox George W.

The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]], and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered [[Jon Lester]], who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5{{sfrac|2|3}} shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] and pinch-hitter [[Bobby Kielty]] secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series.\n\n====2008\u20132012: Injuries and Collapses====\nThe Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7\u20130. Down the stretch, outfielder [[Manny Ramirez]] became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 1, 2008}}</ref> With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. The Red Sox defeated the [[2008 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]] three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]].

In 2010 they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs. In 2011 the [[2011 Boston Red Sox season#Collapse|Red Sox collapsed]], becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, as they went 7\u201320 in the final month and failed again to make the playoffs. In December 2011, [[Bobby Valentine]] was hired as a new manager. The 2012 season marked the centennial of [[Fenway Park]], and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. They finished 69\u201393 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.\n\n[[File:Massachusetts State House Red Sox Banner.JPG|thumb|The [[Massachusetts State House]] displaying a banner in honor of the Red Sox's [[2013 World Series]] appearance]]\n\n====Boston Strong: 2013 World Series Champions====\n{{main|2013 Boston Red Sox season|2013 World Series}}\nBoston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69\u201393 record in 2012\u201326 games behind the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]], became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L.

These acquisitions included veteran catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Mike Napoli]], and [[Shane Victorino]]. While some questioned these players as \"re-treads\", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011\u20132012 by bringing in \"clubhouse players\". Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran [[John Lackey]] coming off [[Tommy John surgery]] and both Jon Lester and [[Clay Buchholz]] returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both [[closer (baseball)|closers]], [[Joel Hanrahan]] and [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]], went down early with season-ending injuries. Farrell gave the closing job to [[Koji Uehara]] on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].<ref>The Uehara Phenomenon http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/18/the-uehara-phenomenon/</ref>  On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters.<ref>Browne, I.

On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, \"This is our fucking city! And nobody is going to dictate our freedom! Stay strong!\" For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox \"B\" logo and the word \"Strong\" within a blue circle. The team also hung up in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] a custom jersey that read \"Boston Strong\" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's [[area code]]. On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial [[first pitch]]. Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional [[duck tour|duck boat]] victory [[parade]], in which they placed the [[World Series trophy]] and the custom 617 jersey on the [[Boston Marathon]] finish line on [[Boylston Street]], followed by a moment of silence and a singing of [[God Bless America]].

He last wore it for the team in 1998. In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, [[Coco Crisp]] (CF), [[David Ortiz]] (DH), and [[DeMarlo Hale]] (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008. Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.\n\nWhile not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redsoxdiehard.com/players/unifnums.html|title=Red Sox All-Time Uniform Numbers}}</ref> specifically:<ref name=\"boston.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2009/07/sox_to_retire_r.html|title=Sox to retire Rice's number tonight|date=July 28, 2009|accessdate=August 31, 2009|first=Gary|last=Dzen|work=The Boston Globe}}</ref>\n* 21: '''[[Roger Clemens]] RHP (1984\u20131996)'''.\n* 33: '''[[Jason Varitek]] C (1997\u20132011)'''; retired as member of Red Sox.\n* 49: '''[[Tim Wakefield]] RHP (1995\u20132011)'''; retired as member of Red Sox.\n\nThere has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of [[Tony Conigliaro]]'s number '''25'''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lynnjournal.com/2016/05/27/effort-being-renewed-to-retire-tony-conigliaros-red-sox-jersey/|title=Effort Being Renewed to Retire Tony Conigliaro's Red Sox Jersey|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=December 26, 2016|first=Cary|last=Shuman|work=Lynn Journal}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.southcoasttoday.com/article/20151227/SPORTS/151229623|title=What ifs not enough to retire Tony C's number 25|date=December 27, 2015|accessdate=December 26, 2016|first=Jon|last=Couture|work=South Coast Today}}</ref> Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has continued to be issued to individuals, including players [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Steve Renko]], [[Mark Clear]], [[Ed Romero]], [[Don Baylor]], [[Larry Parrish]], [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]], [[Jeff Russell]], [[Troy O'Leary]], [[Jeremy Giambi]], [[Ellis Burks]], [[Adam Hyzdu]], [[Mike Lowell]], [[Jackie Bradley Jr.]], [[Kyle Kendrick]], [[Rajai Davis]], [[Steve Pearce (baseball)|Steve Pearce]] and [[Kevin Plawecki]]; coach [[Dwight Evans (Baseball)|Dwight Evans]], and manager [[Bobby Valentine]].\n\nUntil the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9\u20134\u20131\u20138. It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the [[1918 World Series]], the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order. In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14) followed by Robinson's 42. As additional numbers are retired (e.g.: Martinez's 45, Boggs's 26, Ortiz's 34), Robinson's 42 is moved to the right so it remains the right-most number hanging.\n\n==Baseball Hall of Famers==\n{{more|List of Boston Red Sox Hall of Famers}}\n{{Baseball hall of fame list\n|Current Team Name=Boston Red Sox\n| All Team Names=Red Sox\n| ColorA#=BD3039\n| ColorB#=FFFFFF\n| ColorC#=0D2B56\n| ColorD#=FFFFFF\n| Team Name 1 =\n| List 1.1=[[Luis Aparicio]]<br />\n'''[[Wade Boggs]]''' *<br />\n[[Lou Boudreau]]<br />\n[[Jesse Burkett]]<br />\n[[Orlando Cepeda]]<br />\n[[Jack Chesbro]]<br />\n'''[[Jimmy Collins]]''' *<br />\n'''[[Joe Cronin]]''' *\n| List 1.2=[[Andre Dawson]]<br />\n'''[[Bobby Doerr]]''' *<br />\n[[Dennis Eckersley]]<br />\n'''[[Rick Ferrell]]''' * <br />\n'''[[Carlton Fisk]]''' <br />\n'''[[Jimmie Foxx]]''' <br />\n'''[[Lefty Grove]]''' \n| List 1.3=[[Rickey Henderson]]<br />\n'''[[Harry Hooper]]''' *<br />\n[[Waite Hoyt]]<br />\n[[Ferguson Jenkins]]<br />\n[[George Kell]]<br />\n[[Heinie Manush]]<br />\n[[Juan Marichal]]\n| List 1.4='''[[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]]''' *<br />\n'''[[Herb Pennock]]''' <br />\n[[Tony P\u00e9rez]]<br />\n'''[[Jim Rice]]''' *<br />\n[[Red Ruffing]]<br />\n[[Babe Ruth]]<br />\n[[Tom Seaver]]\n| List 1.5 =[[Al Simmons]]<br />\n[[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]]<br />\n[[John Smoltz]]<br />\n[[Tris Speaker]]<br />\n[[Dick Williams]]<br />\n'''[[Ted Williams]]''' *<br />\n'''[[Carl Yastrzemski]]''' *<br />\n[[Tom Yawkey]] * <br />\n[[Cy Young]]\n| Team Name 2=\n| List 2.1=\n| List 2.2=\n| List 2.3=\n| List 2.4=\n| List 2.5=\n| Team Name 3=\n| List 3.1=\n| List 3.2=\n| List 3.3=\n| List 3.4=\n| List 3.5=\n| Team Name 4=\n| List 4.1=\n| List 4.2=\n| List 4.3=\n| List 4.4=\n| List 4.5=\n| Footnote1=* Boston Red Sox listed as primary team according to the Hall of Fame\n| Footnote2=\n| Footnote3=\n| Footnote4=\n|}}\n\n===Ford C.

Darius and S. Gir\u0117nas Airport''' (''S. Dariaus ir S. Gir\u0117no aerodromas'') {{airport codes||EYKS}}, also known as '''Aleksotas Airport''' (''Aleksoto aerodromas''), is a small [[airport]] located in [[Aleksotas]] district of [[Kaunas]] City ([[Lithuania]]), about 3 kilometres South-west from city centre. On May 6, 1993, the airport was named after the Lithuanian pilots [[Steponas Darius]] and [[Stasys Gir\u0117nas]], who perished in a crash near the end of an [[Lituanica#Flight|attempted non-stop flight from New York to Lithuania]] in 1933.\n\n==Military use==\n\nS. Darius and S. Gir\u0117nas Airport was conceived as military [[airport]], established by [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] in 1915, after it captured [[Kaunas Fortress]]. Used continuously since then it is the oldest functioning airport in Lithuania, making it also one of the oldest airports in [[Europe]]. The airport area underwent major upgrades in 1926, 1931, 1942 (800 m. concrete runway with taxiways, repair hangars built), 1950's (concrete runway extension to 1330 m.) and 1970's (passenger terminal, navigation equipment).\n\nDuring the [[Interwar period]], when Kaunas was Lithuania's capital, Aleksotas Airport was used as primary base of Lithuanian Air Force. It also served as test ground for locally built airplanes, like [[Dobi I]], [[Dobi II]], [[Dobi III]] by [[Jurgis Dobkevi\u010dius]], [[Anbo I]], [[Anbo II]], [[Anbo III]], [[Anbo IV]] and [[Anbo 41]], [[Anbo V]], [[Anbo VI]], [[Anbo VII]] and [[Anbo VIII]] by [[Antanas Gustaitis]], gliders.<ref>[[List of Lithuanian gliders]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe airport suffered heavily during World War II. On June 22, 1941, [[Luftwaffe]] on the ground destroyed most of [[Red Army]] aircraft, stationed in Aleksotas Airfield. Airport infrastructure suffered major damage in July 1944 during the battle for Kaunas. Retreating [[Wehrmacht]] destroyed most of the hangars, and heavily damaged runway and taxiways.\n\nIn 1940-1941 and in 1944-1993 it was used as a Soviet (1991-1993 - Russian) airbase, in 1941-1944 as a German Luftwaffe base. Soviet Air Force used Aleksotas Airport as military transport and military helicopter base, with stationed [[Mil Mi-2]], [[Mil Mi-6]] and [[Mil Mi-8]] helicopters prior to its full withdrawal in August 1993.\n\nOn May 20, 2016, Lithuanian Air Force moved its Second Search and Rescue post (three helicopter landing areas, one helicopter on constant duty) from [[Freda Airfield]] (Kaunas Aviation Plant airfield, EYKG)<ref>[[:lt:Kauno aviacijos gamyklos aerodromas]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} to Aleksotas Airport.\n\n==Civil air communication==\n\nThe civil air communication was started by the German airlines in 1921. Initially the mail and passenger line [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]-[[Kaunas]] was served by [[Lloyd Luftdienst]], [[Danziger Luftdienst]], [[Danziger Luftpost]]. German-Soviet airline [[Deruluft]] airline opened regular service [[K\u00f6nigsberg]]-Kaunas-[[Smolensk]]-[[Moscow]] in May 1922. This was later expanded to the route [[Berlin]]-[[Gda\u0144sk|Danzig]]-K\u00f6nigsberg-Kaunas-Smolensk-Moscow. In 1923-1925 Latvian airline [[Latvijas Gaisa Satiksmes Akciju Sabiedriba|Latvijas Gaisa Satiksmes AS]] operated K\u00f6nigsberg-Kaunas-Riga-Tallinn-Helsinki route, with the latter being closed in 1925 due to low profitability and withdrawal of Latvian government subsidies. Since 1938 Polish airline LOT operated flights on the route [[Warsaw]]-Kaunas-[[Riga]]-[[Helsinki]], also connecting with Stockholm{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.\n\nIn 1931 the first passenger terminal was built, it was destroyed during World War II. A new Terminal was built in the 1970s{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}.\n\nAleksotas airport was the base of the first Lithuanian airline: the national airline [[Lietuvos oro linijos]] was founded in 1938, when Lithuanian government ordered two British-built twin engine six-seat planes [[Percival Petrel|Percival Q 6 Petrel]]. The planes were registered LY-SOA and LY-SOB and, commemorating the national trans-Atlantic heroes, were respectively named \"Steponas Darius\" and \"Stasys Gir\u0117nas\". The first Lithuanian civil airline was inaugurated on 5 September 1938 with domestic flights from Kaunas (the country's provisional capital at that time) to the coastal resort of [[Palanga]]. Later in 1939 ''Lietuvos oro linijos'' launched international flights to Riga (Latvia).<ref>http://www.sumin.lt/en/activities/sectors_activities The Ministry of Transport and Communications of Lithuania. Civil Aviation</ref>\n\nAll international connections were disrupted on June 16, 1940 when the airport was captured by the Red Army. Civil flights to Moscow were launched at the end of 1940 after the formal integration of Lithuania into the Soviet Union.\n\nIn the early 1950s regular civilian connections with other towns (but then only within USSR) were opened. Due to a short runway and limited extension possibilities the airport could accept only a very limited number of jet aircraft types. In the 1980s, Aleksotas Airport was considered one of the most dangerous airports in Europe due to its short runway.<ref>http://vyrud.livejournal.com/100565.html LiveJournal. Kaunas Aleksotas airport</ref> It is claimed that only one type of jet - the [[Yak-40]] - could use this airport. Even so, in the 1980s it was a base for about 15 Yak planes, connecting with nearly 30 cities within the USSR, as far as Odessa and Simferopol{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. Regular passenger flights in Aleksotas airport were stopped in 1988 and were moved to a new [[Kaunas Airport|Kaunas International Airport]] in Karm\u0117lava at the northeastern outskirts of Kaunas. Paradoxically, the opening of the new airport coincided with long term decrease in the number of connections from Kaunas: the new airport had limited passenger facilities and the economic downturn of the early 1990s resulted in a significant overall reduction of air communication.\n\nAfter the withdrawal of the Russian Air Force in 1993, Aleksotas / S. Darius and S. Gir\u0117nas Airport serves general aviation. The airport hosts the Kaunas Air Club.\n\nIts historical importance makes it a natural host for the [[Lithuanian Aviation Museum]]. The old passenger terminal building was transferred to Aviation Museum on February 19, 1990.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Steponas Darius]] and [[Stasys Gir\u0117nas]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links, sources==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091106230345/http://www.aerokaunas.lt/english/ Kaunas Aeroclub]\n*[https://archive.is/20060619105008/http://193.219.160.44/aerokaunas/  S.
