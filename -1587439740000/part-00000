According to CBS journalist George Mair, Taylor was Winfrey's \"first intense, to die for love affair\". Winfrey helped get Taylor a job at WVOL, and according to Mair, \"did everything to keep him, including literally begging him on her knees to stay with her.\"<ref name=\"Mair pg 33\">Mair (1999) p. 33</ref> Taylor, however, was unwilling to leave Nashville with Winfrey when she moved to Baltimore to work at WJZ-TV in June 1976. \"We really did care for each other\", Winfrey would later recall. \"We shared a deep love. A love I will never forget.\"<ref name=\"Mair pg 43\">Mair (1999), p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Winfrey had a romantic relationship with [[John Tesh]]. Biographer [[Kitty Kelley]] claims that Tesh split with Winfrey over the pressure of having an interracial relationship.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/12/oprah-john-tesh-briefly-dated-lived-toger-new-book-claims/?test=faces|publisher=Fox News|title=Oprah and John Tesh Briefly Dated, Lived Together, New Book Claims|date=April 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\nWhen WJZ-TV management criticized Winfrey for crying on the air while reporting tragedies and were unhappy with her physical appearance (especially when her hair fell out as the result of a bad perm), Winfrey turned to reporter Lloyd Kramer for comfort. \"Lloyd was just the best\", Winfrey would later recall. \"That man loved me even when I was bald!

I wasn't living with him. I'd never lived with anyone\u2014and I thought I was worthless without him. The more he rejected me, the more I wanted him. I felt depleted, powerless. At the end, I was down on the floor on my knees groveling and pleading with him\".<ref name=\"Mair pg 49\"/> Winfrey became so depressed that on September 8, 1981, she wrote a suicide note to best friend [[Gayle King]] instructing King to water her plants.<ref name=\"Mair pg 49\">Mair (1999), p. 49.</ref> \"That suicide note had been much overplayed\" Winfrey told ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine. \"I couldn't kill myself. I would be afraid the minute I did it, something really good would happen and I'd miss it.\"<ref Name=\"Mair p50\">Mair (1999), p. 50.</ref>\n\nAccording to Winfrey, her emotional turmoil gradually led to a weight problem: \"The reason I gained so much weight in the first place and the reason I had such a sorry history of abusive relationships with men was I just needed approval so much. I needed everyone to like me, because I didn't like myself much. So I'd end up with these cruel self-absorbed guys who'd tell me how selfish I was, and I'd say 'Oh thank you, you're so right' and be grateful to them. Because I had no sense that I deserved anything else. Which is also why I gained so much weight later on. It was the perfect way of cushioning myself against the world's disapproval.\"<ref Name=\"Mair p50\"/>\n\nWinfrey later confessed to smoking [[crack cocaine]] with a man she was romantically involved with during the same era. She explained on her show: \"I always felt that the drug itself is not the problem but that I was addicted to the man.\" She added: \"I can't think of anything I wouldn't have done for that man.\"<ref name=\"Jet\">{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v87/ai_16404541 |title=Oprah reveals on her show she smoked crack cocaine during her 20s |work=Jet |date=January 30, 1995 |accessdate=August 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208105953/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n12_v87/ai_16404541 |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df= }} Archived at FindArticles in 2004.</ref>\n\nWinfrey was allegedly involved in a second drug-related love affair.

In the book's editorial review, [[Michael Bronski]] wrote, \"In the recent past, lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered people had almost no presence on television.

During the 21-day trip, Winfrey and her crew visited schools and orphanages in poverty-stricken areas, and distributed Christmas presents to 50,000 children,<ref Name=\"Christmas Kindness\">{{cite web|title=Christmas Kindness|publisher=Harpo Productions|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/ChristmasKindness-Inspiration|accessdate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> with dolls for the girls and soccer balls for the boys, and school supplies. Throughout the show, Winfrey appealed to viewers to donate money to Oprah's Angel Network for poor and AIDS-affected children in Africa. From that show alone, viewers around the world donated over $7,000,000. Winfrey invested $40&nbsp;million and some of her time establishing the [[Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls]] in [[Henley on Klip]] south of [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. The school set over 22 acres, opened in January 2007 with an enrollment of 150 pupils (increasing to 450) and features state-of-the-art classrooms, computer and science laboratories, a library, theatre, and beauty salon. [[Nelson Mandela]] praised Winfrey for overcoming her own disadvantaged youth to become a benefactor for others.

His father was a clerk in the Kedah State Service and his mother a homemaker Zainuddin Affan & Hasimah Hassan.  Daim received his early education at the Malay Primary School in Seberang Perak, Alor Setar and then advanced to the Special Malay Class at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College, which was an English\u2013medium school.\n\n==Educations==\nBeing a youth of the 40s, during a period when the British Colonial Policy encouraged Malays to attend Malay schools, when Malay parents worried about the possible influence of an English education on their children's religious faith and cultural identity, Daim and his parents were able to transcend these limitations.  In fact, his broad-minded parents enrolled all their children at English\u2013medium schools as they did not want their children to become \"better farmers and fishermen\". However, Daim was very much an absentee student.  He had worked out a strategic studying method whereby he would only need to focus on subjects that he would need to pass to advance to the next class and that required little effort \u2013 English and Malay languages and Mathematics.  He devoted his free time to pursuing his main interest which was sports and more sports.\n\nCareer-wise, Daim would have ended up as a teacher except that due to some miscommunication he had been totally unaware that his name was on the list of successful candidates for Brinsford College, England, a teacher training college.\n\nThroughout his youth, he was very much encouraged by a mother who wanted him to further his studies and a father who wanted him to become a lawyer. His mother sold some land to raise money for him to study law in England. Realizing that \"time is money\", the former absentee student became a diligent and disciplined scholar in law who after eighteen months at Lincoln's Inn London and at the youthful age of 21, was called to the English Bar in 1959. It was also during his student days in London that he developed his voracious appetite for reading which till today is his favourite pastime.\n \nIn 2019, Daim at the age of 81 after retirement, working on the thesis regarding the [[New Economic Policy]] for 11 years finally obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree from [[Universiti Malaya]] (UM).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/10/12/phd-for-daim-zainuddin-on-the-new-economic-policy/|date=October 13, 2010|author=|work=[[Bernama]]|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|title=PhD for Daim Zainuddin on the New Economic Policy|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon his return to Malaysia from England after his studies, he started reading in the chambers of Pillai & Co. and later, the chambers of Shearn Delamore which was then the largest law firm in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, he decided to move and work in [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kelantan]] under the tutelage of Encik Wan Mustaffa who was legal adviser to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PMIP) which later became known as [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Parti Islam Se-Malaysia]] (PAS).  After his stint in Kota Bharu, he joined the Malaysian Civil Service as a Magistrate, then became the President of the Sessions Court in Johor and subsequently became Deputy Public Prosecutor in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]].  He resigned from the service in 1965, returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined the law firm of Allen & Gledhill for the next three years till his resignation in 1968 to start his own law practice of Daim & Gamany. In 1969, however, he decided to venture into business.\n\n==Business==\nHis first business venture was in salt production, partly because it seemed easy and partly because his partner's [[feng shui]] indicated that he should work with water. They went to [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]] to study salt production, weather forecast, soil condition and location. During the start-up they proceeded to clear {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of the coastal land of [[Kuala Selangor]], but because the rain came unseasonably early just when the salt had begun to crystallise, they were almost bankrupted by it.\n\nDaim's great break was in 1971, when he decided to venture into land and property development.  Together with two other partners, he formed a company, Syarikat Maluri Sdn Bhd of which he held a 60% majority control. The Company bought and developed [[Taman Bukit Maluri]], [[Kepong]] and Daim became the first full-fledged Malay property developer in Kuala Lumpur.  Having ventured into a predominantly Chinese sector, he might have expected to encounter insurmountable problems, but he did not, because it was 1971 that the then [[Tun Abdul Razak|Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak]] introduced the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] that was an ambitious and controversial socio-economic restructuring affirmative action program. The NEP targeted a 30% share of the economy for the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]. Hence, being only a handful of Bumiputeras involved in this sector, Daim naturally gained advantages from the Government over his Chinese counterparts.\n\nHis next venture was in plastics production.  After he obtained a license however, another two licenses were issued and this instigated early and keen competition to Daim's fledgling company.  Furthermore, the workers were incited to strike and eventually the venture proved to be another bankrupting business.  Fortunately, his other downstream ventures which included the plastic packaging company, Daibochi and the snack food factory, Sedap Food flourished and were later listed on the [[Bursa Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange]] (KLSE).  He also invested in the Ports' downstream business with stevedoring, forwarding and low-loader licenses and had set up a manufacturing plant making steel and iron products like manhole covers and telephone posts. The success of these ventures helped towards offsetting loans and borrowings of the failed venture.\nAfter gaining a foothold in the property business, he began to look for other challenges to pursue and to prove that a Malaysian of Malay ethnicity could succeed in other fields. At the same time, other corporate and political stars were rising and Daim wanted to be \"the Malay to do it\" and so, he forged ahead and bought a 30% equity interest in United Estates Project (UEP) now known as Sime Darby\u2013UEP (developer of the popular '[[Subang Jaya]]' township) and went on picking up stakes in the share market, mostly strategic rather than controlling stakes.\n\nHe was willing to take risks but also saw opportunities before others.  When President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] of France came into power and decided to nationalise all French banks, Daim saw an opportunity whilst others were grumbling about the new socialist policies.  He knew that Malaysian banking regulations did not allow for government-owned banks to operate in Malaysia and therefore knew that Bank Indo-Suez will either have to close its operations in Malaysia or be sold-off.  He wrote a 'cold-call' letter to the chairman/President of the Bank registering his interest in the event that they would want to sell.  Of course rather than closing down the Bank they decided to sell to Daim and in 1981 he became the owner of Indo-Suez later renamed the Malaysian-French Bank.  Later when United Malayan Banking Corporation (then the 2nd largest bank in Malaysia) became available, he exchanged his majority stake in Malaysian-French Bank for a smaller stake in this larger bank.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1984 he was appointed Minister of Finance.  He never lost his love for the banking industry and after he retired he started investing in small banks overseas in Europe and Africa.  As the business expanded, the banks needed to be organised under a bigger parent bank and he therefore acquired Hock Hua Bank (which he renamed International Bank of Malaysia Berhad) which was one of the smallest banks in Malaysia.  Again he had to dispose of his stake when he was reappointed Minister of Finance in 1998.  After his second retirement he is now again actively involved in the banking industry.\n\nApart from business, politics have always interested Daim. His earliest exposure was as a student in London whereby though not actively involved in politics, he shared his fellow students interests in the political issues of the day particularly independence and post-independence implications on the socio\u2013economic and religious mosaic of pluralistic Malaysia.\n\nHis first encounter with real politics albeit covertly was when in 1966, as a lawyer with Allen & Gledhill, the firm was appointed by the Federal Government of Malaysia to act for the Governor of Sarawak in a case against the Chief Minister of that State. Back in Kuala Lumpur, Daim was asked to attend a Cabinet meeting whereat he briefed the Cabinet members of the political situation in Sarawak and impressed upon the Cabinet the need for emergency to be declared to avert a worsening of the situation caused by the demonstrations against the Chief Minister's minority government. Emergency was declared.  However, the security risk persisted and the Governor as advised by the central government suspended the Standing Orders of the House and called for a meeting of the Assembly using emergency powers. Daim assisted in drafting the statement of the Governor that the Assembly was to debate; the Assembly met, the Chief Minister's government was voted out of office. Impressed by his legal skills and political knowledge, the Prime Minister offered Daim a seat in Sungai Petani in the 1974 general elections but Daim declined, choosing instead to establish his credentials in business.\n\nCome 1977, Daim decided that he was financially comfortable enough to retire. His retirement plan then was to go back to school and so he enrolled at University of California Berkeley to pursue a course in Urban Planning. At around the same time, he enjoyed a close rapport with the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].\n\nIn 1978, Daim met Mahathir in Los Angeles and San Francisco, when Mahathir urged Daim to return to Malaysia and contest in the general election that year. At the same time, Daim was also offered the Chairmanship of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by the Public Enterprises Minister. Daim was not interested in taking up the Chairmanship of UDA which he deemed too big and widespread, too bureaucratic and doing too many things at the same time. Instead he suggested that UDA should form a holding company and transfer all its commercial property and commercial assets to it; only then would be agree to manage it. Hence, Peremba was established and Daim became its non-executive chairman with a team of young and bright hand\u2013picked officers assisting him. While not many could take his punishing rigours and demands of work and discipline, those who did went on to become successful entrepreneurs and notable amongst these were Tan Sri Wan Azmi Bin Wan Hamzah, Tan Sri Halim Bin Saad, and Tan Sri Samsuddin Bin Abu Hassan. In 1980, Daim was informed that the Prime Minister [[Hussein Onn|Tun Hussein Onn]] had appointed him as Senator in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nWhen Mahathir became Prime Minister in 1981, he sent Daim on a number of missions. The first was to the [[United States of America]] (USA) to deal with the problem posed by the USA's General Services Administration (GSA) tin stockpile releases which caused the price of tin to tumble, thus adversely affecting the Malaysian tin industry, it being a major producer of tin. Knowing that the tin miners' hardship would not move the Americans but that the communist threat would, Daim decided to take on this hard line in his negotiations with them. It worked and the GSA agreed to limit their stockpile releases to 3,000 tonnes a year for three years.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Government of Malaysia]] announced the adoption of the 'Buy British last' policy which actually was a culmination of a series of problems with the United Kingdom (UK). Prevalent was a new spirit of Malaysian nationalism which was manifested in the acquisition of Guthrie Estate by Permodalan Nasional Berhad, the Government\u2013owned national equity corporation; the return of Seri Carcosa (premises which had been given to the British by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al\u2013Haj]], Malaysia's first Prime Minister;) and the steep hike in fees of British Universities. To this day, very few Malaysians are aware that Daim was instrumental in working behind the scenes to resolve these issues and restore good relations with the British.\n\nHowever, the event that truly launched Daim's political career was the day before nominations for the 1982 General Elections, when Mahathir rang Daim to say that he was to contest the Kuala Muda Parliamentary seat. Within the short span of the next two years, his rise in politics was meteoric as he was appointed the Minister of Finance in 1984. At that same time the burgeoning economy kept up its momentum despite the high rate of borrowing and spending to keep the economy healthy. The full impact of the world recession on Malaysia was only felt in 1985. Internally too, there were many abuses involving the financial institutions brought about by lack of proper supervision and control. By the time he took over, Daim could not avert the scandals, crisis and failures. However, Daim set about implementing a strict code of monetary and financial management to prevent the disease from becoming terminal for the whole economy.\n\nHe stopped the practice of borrowing to beef up funds for spending, he curtailed expenditure to suit income, he slashed the allocation for the public sector \u2013 upsetting many quarters. In the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, Malaysia paid off about RM6.8 billion of her foreign debts which was earlier than scheduled, a record repayment for developing nations. The Far Eastern Economic Review, which had made dire predictions about Malaysia's economy in 1986, admitted in its issue of 1 September 1988 that Daim's effective management style had contributed positively and tremendously to Malaysia's economic recovery.\n\nDaim resigned as Finance Minister in March 1991, and the news caused a stir both in Malaysia and abroad because it was not in the Malaysian culture to resign from a high office. Therefore, when it happened there was a great deal of speculation as to why, and of course the most prominent was that which cited the irreconcilable differences with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. For Daim, the reason was that he had accomplished his tasks \u2013 reorganised and improved the country's financial position. Further, the Prime Minister reiterated by saying that \"Daim had agreed to take the post on condition that he stay only to help reorganize and improve the country's financial position. He said he had fulfilled this task and it was time I let him go.\" In accepting his resignation, the Prime Minister also welcomed his readiness to contribute his ideas to the nation. To crown it all, the Prime Minister recommended Daim for the \"Tun\" title \u2013 the highest honour of the land. And so on 5 June 1991, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] [[Sultan Azlan Shah]] conferred on Daim the [[Seri Setia Mahkota]] award, which carries the title \"Tun\".\n\nPrior to his resignation, in 1991, Daim's contribution was succinctly summed up as thus: \u201cDespite having much of his tenure clouded in controversy, the outgoing Finance Minister has nonetheless earned the reputation as one of the country\u2019s ablest economic architects, having steered Malaysia through recession into four straight years of high growth.\u201d In another article, \u201cDaim exits office having earned the distinction of being a hard\u2013driving technocrat, who resisted pressure by rival ministers who wanted to alter fiscal policy for political expediency \u2026.\u201d\n\nIt was also recognised that during his tenure as the Finance Minister, Daim had implemented four broad strategic structural reforms during the 1986 to 1991 period namely the mobilisation of the private sector, active external policies, the supportive role of the private sector and the rehabilitation of the public enterprises. To this day, the tenets of his economic policies are held in high esteem and are continually pursued to either jump start or sustain the Malaysian economy.\n\nAlthough technically out of the Government, Daim was still perceived as a man to be reckoned with \u2013 an entity greater than the sum of his overt responsibilities when he was appointed Economic Advisor to the Government, Chairman of the Northern Growth Triangle, the Labuan Development Authority and the Langkawi development Authority and also the Treasurer of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling coalition, [[Barisan Nasional]] (National Front). He was also Malaysia's representative to the East Asean Growth Area (EAGA).\n\nIn 1997 when the Asian crisis swept through Asia leaving behind devastated economics in its wake, Daim Zainuddin was recalled to public service.\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Daim was sacked from UMNO together with party veterans; [[Rafidah Aziz]] and [[Rais Yatim]] for supporting [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and opposition [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/umno-sacks-two-ex-ministers-for-backing-opposition/|accessdate=7 May 2018|agency=[[New Strait Times]]|title=Malaysia

politician, businessman and former [[Minister of Finance (Malaysia)|Finance Minister of Malaysia]] from 1984 to 1991.\n\n==Early life==\nDaim bin Zainuddin is the youngest of thirteen siblings.  His father was a clerk in the Kedah State Service and his mother a homemaker Zainuddin Affan & Hasimah Hassan.  Daim received his early education at the Malay Primary School in Seberang Perak, Alor Setar and then advanced to the Special Malay Class at the Sultan Abdul Hamid College, which was an English\u2013medium school.\n\n==Educations==\nBeing a youth of the 40s, during a period when the British Colonial Policy encouraged Malays to attend Malay schools, when Malay parents worried about the possible influence of an English education on their children's religious faith and cultural identity, Daim and his parents were able to transcend these limitations.  In fact, his broad-minded parents enrolled all their children at English\u2013medium schools as they did not want their children to become \"better farmers and fishermen\". However, Daim was very much an absentee student.  He had worked out a strategic studying method whereby he would only need to focus on subjects that he would need to pass to advance to the next class and that required little effort \u2013 English and Malay languages and Mathematics.  He devoted his free time to pursuing his main interest which was sports and more sports.\n\nCareer-wise, Daim would have ended up as a teacher except that due to some miscommunication he had been totally unaware that his name was on the list of successful candidates for Brinsford College, England, a teacher training college.\n\nThroughout his youth, he was very much encouraged by a mother who wanted him to further his studies and a father who wanted him to become a lawyer. His mother sold some land to raise money for him to study law in England. Realizing that \"time is money\", the former absentee student became a diligent and disciplined scholar in law who after eighteen months at Lincoln's Inn London and at the youthful age of 21, was called to the English Bar in 1959. It was also during his student days in London that he developed his voracious appetite for reading which till today is his favourite pastime.\n \nIn 2019, Daim at the age of 81 after retirement, working on the thesis regarding the [[New Economic Policy]] for 11 years finally obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) degree from [[Universiti Malaya]] (UM).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/10/12/phd-for-daim-zainuddin-on-the-new-economic-policy/|date=October 13, 2010|author=|work=[[Bernama]]|publisher=[[Free Malaysia Today]]|title=PhD for Daim Zainuddin on the New Economic Policy|accessdate=November 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nUpon his return to Malaysia from England after his studies, he started reading in the chambers of Pillai & Co. and later, the chambers of Shearn Delamore which was then the largest law firm in Kuala Lumpur. In 1961, he decided to move and work in [[Kota Bharu]], [[Kelantan]] under the tutelage of Encik Wan Mustaffa who was legal adviser to the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PMIP) which later became known as [[Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party|Parti Islam Se-Malaysia]] (PAS).  After his stint in Kota Bharu, he joined the Malaysian Civil Service as a Magistrate, then became the President of the Sessions Court in Johor and subsequently became Deputy Public Prosecutor in [[Ipoh]], [[Perak]].  He resigned from the service in 1965, returned to Kuala Lumpur and joined the law firm of Allen & Gledhill for the next three years till his resignation in 1968 to start his own law practice of Daim & Gamany. In 1969, however, he decided to venture into business.\n\n==Business==\nHis first business venture was in salt production, partly because it seemed easy and partly because his partner's [[feng shui]] indicated that he should work with water. They went to [[Thailand]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]] to study salt production, weather forecast, soil condition and location. During the start-up they proceeded to clear {{convert|600|acre|km2}} of the coastal land of [[Kuala Selangor]], but because the rain came unseasonably early just when the salt had begun to crystallise, they were almost bankrupted by it.\n\nDaim's great break was in 1971, when he decided to venture into land and property development.  Together with two other partners, he formed a company, Syarikat Maluri Sdn Bhd of which he held a 60% majority control. The Company bought and developed [[Taman Bukit Maluri]], [[Kepong]] and Daim became the first full-fledged Malay property developer in Kuala Lumpur.  Having ventured into a predominantly Chinese sector, he might have expected to encounter insurmountable problems, but he did not, because it was 1971 that the then [[Tun Abdul Razak|Prime Minister Tun Abdul Razak]] introduced the [[New Economic Policy (Malaysia)|New Economic Policy]] that was an ambitious and controversial socio-economic restructuring affirmative action program. The NEP targeted a 30% share of the economy for the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]]. Hence, being only a handful of Bumiputeras involved in this sector, Daim naturally gained advantages from the Government over his Chinese counterparts.\n\nHis next venture was in plastics production.  After he obtained a license however, another two licenses were issued and this instigated early and keen competition to Daim's fledgling company.  Furthermore, the workers were incited to strike and eventually the venture proved to be another bankrupting business.  Fortunately, his other downstream ventures which included the plastic packaging company, Daibochi and the snack food factory, Sedap Food flourished and were later listed on the [[Bursa Malaysia|Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange]] (KLSE).  He also invested in the Ports' downstream business with stevedoring, forwarding and low-loader licenses and had set up a manufacturing plant making steel and iron products like manhole covers and telephone posts. The success of these ventures helped towards offsetting loans and borrowings of the failed venture.\nAfter gaining a foothold in the property business, he began to look for other challenges to pursue and to prove that a Malaysian of Malay ethnicity could succeed in other fields. At the same time, other corporate and political stars were rising and Daim wanted to be \"the Malay to do it\" and so, he forged ahead and bought a 30% equity interest in United Estates Project (UEP) now known as Sime Darby\u2013UEP (developer of the popular '[[Subang Jaya]]' township) and went on picking up stakes in the share market, mostly strategic rather than controlling stakes.\n\nHe was willing to take risks but also saw opportunities before others.  When President [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] of France came into power and decided to nationalise all French banks, Daim saw an opportunity whilst others were grumbling about the new socialist policies.  He knew that Malaysian banking regulations did not allow for government-owned banks to operate in Malaysia and therefore knew that Bank Indo-Suez will either have to close its operations in Malaysia or be sold-off.  He wrote a 'cold-call' letter to the chairman/President of the Bank registering his interest in the event that they would want to sell.  Of course rather than closing down the Bank they decided to sell to Daim and in 1981 he became the owner of Indo-Suez later renamed the Malaysian-French Bank.  Later when United Malayan Banking Corporation (then the 2nd largest bank in Malaysia) became available, he exchanged his majority stake in Malaysian-French Bank for a smaller stake in this larger bank.\n\n==Political career==\nIn 1984 he was appointed Minister of Finance.  He never lost his love for the banking industry and after he retired he started investing in small banks overseas in Europe and Africa.  As the business expanded, the banks needed to be organised under a bigger parent bank and he therefore acquired Hock Hua Bank (which he renamed International Bank of Malaysia Berhad) which was one of the smallest banks in Malaysia.  Again he had to dispose of his stake when he was reappointed Minister of Finance in 1998.  After his second retirement he is now again actively involved in the banking industry.\n\nApart from business, politics have always interested Daim. His earliest exposure was as a student in London whereby though not actively involved in politics, he shared his fellow students interests in the political issues of the day particularly independence and post-independence implications on the socio\u2013economic and religious mosaic of pluralistic Malaysia.\n\nHis first encounter with real politics albeit covertly was when in 1966, as a lawyer with Allen & Gledhill, the firm was appointed by the Federal Government of Malaysia to act for the Governor of Sarawak in a case against the Chief Minister of that State. Back in Kuala Lumpur, Daim was asked to attend a Cabinet meeting whereat he briefed the Cabinet members of the political situation in Sarawak and impressed upon the Cabinet the need for emergency to be declared to avert a worsening of the situation caused by the demonstrations against the Chief Minister's minority government. Emergency was declared.  However, the security risk persisted and the Governor as advised by the central government suspended the Standing Orders of the House and called for a meeting of the Assembly using emergency powers. Daim assisted in drafting the statement of the Governor that the Assembly was to debate; the Assembly met, the Chief Minister's government was voted out of office. Impressed by his legal skills and political knowledge, the Prime Minister offered Daim a seat in Sungai Petani in the 1974 general elections but Daim declined, choosing instead to establish his credentials in business.\n\nCome 1977, Daim decided that he was financially comfortable enough to retire. His retirement plan then was to go back to school and so he enrolled at University of California Berkeley to pursue a course in Urban Planning. At around the same time, he enjoyed a close rapport with the then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Mahathir Mohamad|Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad]].\n\nIn 1978, Daim met Mahathir in Los Angeles and San Francisco, when Mahathir urged Daim to return to Malaysia and contest in the general election that year. At the same time, Daim was also offered the Chairmanship of the Urban Development Authority (UDA) by the Public Enterprises Minister. Daim was not interested in taking up the Chairmanship of UDA which he deemed too big and widespread, too bureaucratic and doing too many things at the same time. Instead he suggested that UDA should form a holding company and transfer all its commercial property and commercial assets to it; only then would be agree to manage it. Hence, Peremba was established and Daim became its non-executive chairman with a team of young and bright hand\u2013picked officers assisting him. While not many could take his punishing rigours and demands of work and discipline, those who did went on to become successful entrepreneurs and notable amongst these were Tan Sri Wan Azmi Bin Wan Hamzah, Tan Sri Halim Bin Saad, and Tan Sri Samsuddin Bin Abu Hassan. In 1980, Daim was informed that the Prime Minister [[Hussein Onn|Tun Hussein Onn]] had appointed him as Senator in the Upper House of Parliament.\n\nWhen Mahathir became Prime Minister in 1981, he sent Daim on a number of missions. The first was to the [[United States of America]] (USA) to deal with the problem posed by the USA's General Services Administration (GSA) tin stockpile releases which caused the price of tin to tumble, thus adversely affecting the Malaysian tin industry, it being a major producer of tin. Knowing that the tin miners' hardship would not move the Americans but that the communist threat would, Daim decided to take on this hard line in his negotiations with them. It worked and the GSA agreed to limit their stockpile releases to 3,000 tonnes a year for three years.\n\nIn 1981, the [[Government of Malaysia]] announced the adoption of the 'Buy British last' policy which actually was a culmination of a series of problems with the United Kingdom (UK). Prevalent was a new spirit of Malaysian nationalism which was manifested in the acquisition of Guthrie Estate by Permodalan Nasional Berhad, the Government\u2013owned national equity corporation; the return of Seri Carcosa (premises which had been given to the British by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman|Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al\u2013Haj]], Malaysia's first Prime Minister;) and the steep hike in fees of British Universities. To this day, very few Malaysians are aware that Daim was instrumental in working behind the scenes to resolve these issues and restore good relations with the British.\n\nHowever, the event that truly launched Daim's political career was the day before nominations for the 1982 General Elections, when Mahathir rang Daim to say that he was to contest the Kuala Muda Parliamentary seat. Within the short span of the next two years, his rise in politics was meteoric as he was appointed the Minister of Finance in 1984. At that same time the burgeoning economy kept up its momentum despite the high rate of borrowing and spending to keep the economy healthy. The full impact of the world recession on Malaysia was only felt in 1985. Internally too, there were many abuses involving the financial institutions brought about by lack of proper supervision and control. By the time he took over, Daim could not avert the scandals, crisis and failures. However, Daim set about implementing a strict code of monetary and financial management to prevent the disease from becoming terminal for the whole economy.\n\nHe stopped the practice of borrowing to beef up funds for spending, he curtailed expenditure to suit income, he slashed the allocation for the public sector \u2013 upsetting many quarters. In the years 1987, 1988 and 1989, Malaysia paid off about RM6.8 billion of her foreign debts which was earlier than scheduled, a record repayment for developing nations. The Far Eastern Economic Review, which had made dire predictions about Malaysia's economy in 1986, admitted in its issue of 1 September 1988 that Daim's effective management style had contributed positively and tremendously to Malaysia's economic recovery.\n\nDaim resigned as Finance Minister in March 1991, and the news caused a stir both in Malaysia and abroad because it was not in the Malaysian culture to resign from a high office. Therefore, when it happened there was a great deal of speculation as to why, and of course the most prominent was that which cited the irreconcilable differences with the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Prime Minister]], Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad. For Daim, the reason was that he had accomplished his tasks \u2013 reorganised and improved the country's financial position. Further, the Prime Minister reiterated by saying that \"Daim had agreed to take the post on condition that he stay only to help reorganize and improve the country's financial position. He said he had fulfilled this task and it was time I let him go.\" In accepting his resignation, the Prime Minister also welcomed his readiness to contribute his ideas to the nation. To crown it all, the Prime Minister recommended Daim for the \"Tun\" title \u2013 the highest honour of the land. And so on 5 June 1991, the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] [[Sultan Azlan Shah]] conferred on Daim the [[Seri Setia Mahkota]] award, which carries the title \"Tun\".\n\nPrior to his resignation, in 1991, Daim's contribution was succinctly summed up as thus: \u201cDespite having much of his tenure clouded in controversy, the outgoing Finance Minister has nonetheless earned the reputation as one of the country\u2019s ablest economic architects, having steered Malaysia through recession into four straight years of high growth.\u201d In another article, \u201cDaim exits office having earned the distinction of being a hard\u2013driving technocrat, who resisted pressure by rival ministers who wanted to alter fiscal policy for political expediency \u2026.\u201d\n\nIt was also recognised that during his tenure as the Finance Minister, Daim had implemented four broad strategic structural reforms during the 1986 to 1991 period namely the mobilisation of the private sector, active external policies, the supportive role of the private sector and the rehabilitation of the public enterprises. To this day, the tenets of his economic policies are held in high esteem and are continually pursued to either jump start or sustain the Malaysian economy.\n\nAlthough technically out of the Government, Daim was still perceived as a man to be reckoned with \u2013 an entity greater than the sum of his overt responsibilities when he was appointed Economic Advisor to the Government, Chairman of the Northern Growth Triangle, the Labuan Development Authority and the Langkawi development Authority and also the Treasurer of the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the leading party in Malaysia's ruling coalition, [[Barisan Nasional]] (National Front). He was also Malaysia's representative to the East Asean Growth Area (EAGA).\n\nIn 1997 when the Asian crisis swept through Asia leaving behind devastated economics in its wake, Daim Zainuddin was recalled to public service.\n\nOn 5 May 2018, Daim was sacked from UMNO together with party veterans; [[Rafidah Aziz]] and [[Rais Yatim]] for supporting [[Mahathir Mohamad]] and opposition [[Pakatan Harapan]] (PH).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/umno-sacks-two-ex-ministers-for-backing-opposition/|accessdate=7 May 2018|agency=[[New Strait Times]]|title=Malaysia

His family trace their origins to [[Longhai City|Longhai]], [[Fujian Province]], [[China]].\n\n== Family History ==\n\nOng Kee Hui was the great-grandson of [[Ong Ewe Hai]] (1830-1889), a leading Sarawakian merchant and [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Rajah Charles Brooke]]'s advisor on Chinese Affairs, and also confidant; grandson of [[Ong Tiang Swee]] (1864-1950), the first Chinese nominated to the [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly|Sarawak Council Negri]] (Legislative Council) in 1937; and son of Ong Kwan Hin (1896-1982), a recognised authority on Chinese temples, who was nominated to the [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly|Sarawak Council Negri]] (Legislative Council) as well.\n\nGenerations of the Ong family played a prominent role for the Hokkien community in Sarawak. His great-grandfather Ong Ewe Hai was a prominent Kapitan China to the Hokkien community of Sarawak, and a successful businessman in multiple fields. His grandfather, Ong Tiang Swee was Kapitan China, and also President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. His father, Ong Kwan Hin was also Kapitan China. Both Ong Tiang Swee and Ong Kwan Hin were the first two Chinese people nominated to the [[Sarawak State Legislative Assembly|Sarawak Council Negri]] (Legislative Council) in 1937.\n\nToday, there are [[List of roads in Kuching|seven roads]] in [[Kuching]], [[Sarawak]] named after generations of the Ong family, some by the [[Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak|Rajah]] in recognition of their contribution to the community. These include Jalan Ewe Hai (also Ewe Hai street), Jalan Ong Tiang Swee, Jalan Ong Kwan Hin, Jalan Ong Kee Hui, Jalan Hui Sing, Jalan Datin Wee (Ong) Siew Eng and Jalan Ong Hup Leong, a branch road of Jalan Ong Tiang Swee.\n\nOng Kee Hui is also related to [[Ong Poh Lim]]. His great grandfather Ong Koon Tian ( d:1837) was born in Bai Jiao, Fujian, China and left for south-east Asia to make his fortune, at which he was not successful - on his death he left three sons and three daughters impoverished.\n\n== Honours ==\nHe was bestowed the titles \"Datuk\" later upgraded to \"Dato' Sri\" (PNBS) and \"Datuk Amar\" (DA) by the Sarawak State Government, \"Datuk\" (PGBK) by the Sabah State Government and \"Tan Sri\" (PMN) by the Government of Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysian Institute of Chemistry also awards the Tan Sri Datuk Ong Kee Hui Postgraduate Chemistry Award to candidates who produce an outstanding thesis.\n\nIn [[Kuching]], there is a road named after him, called Jalan Ong Kee Hui. The headquarters of the [[Sarawak United People's Party]] sits here.\n\nA road called Jalan Hui Sing, or better known as Hui Sing Garden in [[Kuching]] is also named after Ong Kee Hui and Ong Moh Sing in a joint venture development for a residential area.\n\n===Honours of Malaysia===\n* {{Flag|Malaysia}} :\n** [[File:Malaysian Commemorative Medal ribbon.gif|50px]] [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Malaysia|Malaysian Commemorative Medal]] (Silver) (PPM) (1965)\n** [[File:Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia - PSM.svg|50px]] Commander of the [[Order of the Defender of the Realm#Commander|Order of the Defender of the Realm]] (PMN) - '''Tan Sri''' (1975)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/index.php/component/semakanlantikanskp/|title=Semakan Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat}}</ref>\n\n* {{Flag|Sabah}} :\n** [[File:MY-SAB Order of Kinabalu - PGDK.svg|50px]] Commander of the [[Order of Kinabalu#Commander|Order of Kinabalu]] (PGDK) - '''Datuk'''\n* {{Flag|Sarawak}} :\n** [[File:MY-SAR Order of the Star of the Hornbill (Bintang Kenyalang) - 3.

Knight Commander (DA).svg|50px]] Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak]] (DA) - '''Datuk Amar'''\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in 1914 in [[Kuching]], he was educated at St. Thomas's School in Kuching and later St. Andrew's School in [[Singapore]] before receiving his diploma in Agricultural Science from Serdang College (present-day [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]]).\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1935, he entered the [[Sarawak]] Government civil service when he returned home to serve the Department of Agriculture. He believed in Sarawak's cession to Great Britain in 1946, which ended Brooke Sarawak and brought citizenship to Sarawak based on ''jus soli'' to the Chinese, who were regarded as immigrants.\n\nLeaving government service in 1948, Ong entered business under the tutelage of [[Wee Kheng Chiang|Datuk Amar Wee Kheng Chiang]], his father-in-law, who appointed him manager of the family\u2019s Bian Chiang Bank, today known as [[CIMB]] Group, devoting himself to business and banking.\n\n===Rise to politics===\nIn the mid-1950s, Ong Kee Hui started his political career as a nominated member of the Council Negri (State Legislative Council), and he was elected to the Kuching Municipal Council as the Mayor of Kuching and an unofficial member of the Supreme Council (State Cabinet) as Minister of Technology, Research and Local Government.\n\nThe \u201cdivide and rule\u201d method of the British encouraged the communal polarisation of Sarawak politics, something that he and his contemporaries viewed with alarm as boding ill for future Sarawak democracy. To counter this trend, Ong, together with Datuk Amar [[Stephen Yong Kuet Tze]] and colleagues, established the [[Sarawak United People's Party|Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP)]] as Sarawak's first political party in 1959.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinmayer|first=Otto|date=2000|title=Review of Ong Kee Hui's memoirs|url=http://www.ikanlundu.com/Swak_memoirs.html|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume= lxxiii part 1|pages=126\u2013129.|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Malaysia]] was proposed, Ong argued for Sarawak's independence, before joining the greater federation. The [[Sarawak United People's Party]] supported his stance for independence. Ong was also a member of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]]'s Sarawak delegation in 1962.\n\nMalaysia became an independent country in 1963. In 1965, he seized the expulsion of [[Singapore]] to call for a [[referendum]] but was rejected.\n\nAfter much encouragement and pragmatism from then Deputy Prime Minister, [[Tun Abdul Razak]], he was convinced to forge political partnerships and consequently, [[Sarawak United People's Party]] joined the State Government in 1971. He served as the Minister of Local Government and Housing and Minister of Science Technology & Environment under Tun Abdul Razak's Cabinet. However, being a federal minister in Kuala Lumpur divorced him from Sarawakian grassroots politics.\n\nIn 1980, he stood down as party chairman of SUPP and retired to pen his memoirs, Footprints in Sarawak.\n\n== Spouse and Children ==\nOn 14 September 1937, he married Wee Bee Siok ({{zh|c=\u9ec3\u7f8e\u60dc|p=Hu\u00e1ng M\u011bix\u012b}}), the daughter of a successful banker and businessman, [[Wee Kheng Chiang|Datuk Wee Kheng Chiang]], in a traditional Chinese ceremony. They have eight children - two sons and six daughters.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Albert Lau. ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War.'' Routledge, 26 July 2012 pg. 129\n* Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui.

His great grandfather Ong Koon Tian ( d:1837) was born in Bai Jiao, Fujian, China and left for south-east Asia to make his fortune, at which he was not successful - on his death he left three sons and three daughters impoverished.\n\n== Honours ==\nHe was bestowed the titles \"Datuk\" later upgraded to \"Dato' Sri\" (PNBS) and \"Datuk Amar\" (DA) by the Sarawak State Government, \"Datuk\" (PGBK) by the Sabah State Government and \"Tan Sri\" (PMN) by the Government of Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysian Institute of Chemistry also awards the Tan Sri Datuk Ong Kee Hui Postgraduate Chemistry Award to candidates who produce an outstanding thesis.\n\nIn [[Kuching]], there is a road named after him, called Jalan Ong Kee Hui. The headquarters of the [[Sarawak United People's Party]] sits here.\n\nA road called Jalan Hui Sing, or better known as Hui Sing Garden in [[Kuching]] is also named after Ong Kee Hui and Ong Moh Sing in a joint venture development for a residential area.\n\n===Honours of Malaysia===\n* {{Flag|Malaysia}} :\n** [[File:Malaysian Commemorative Medal ribbon.gif|50px]] [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Malaysia|Malaysian Commemorative Medal]] (Silver) (PPM) (1965)\n** [[File:Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia - PSM.svg|50px]] Commander of the [[Order of the Defender of the Realm#Commander|Order of the Defender of the Realm]] (PMN) - '''Tan Sri''' (1975)<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/index.php/component/semakanlantikanskp/|title=Semakan Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat}}</ref>\n\n* {{Flag|Sabah}} :\n** [[File:MY-SAB Order of Kinabalu - PGDK.svg|50px]] Commander of the [[Order of Kinabalu#Commander|Order of Kinabalu]] (PGDK) - '''Datuk'''\n* {{Flag|Sarawak}} :\n** [[File:MY-SAR Order of the Star of the Hornbill (Bintang Kenyalang) - 3.

Knight Commander (DA).svg|50px]] Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak]] (DA) - '''Datuk Amar'''\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in 1914 in [[Kuching]], he was educated at St. Thomas's School in Kuching and later St. Andrew's School in [[Singapore]] before receiving his diploma in Agricultural Science from Serdang College (present-day [[Universiti Putra Malaysia]]).\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1935, he entered the [[Sarawak]] Government civil service when he returned home to serve the Department of Agriculture. He believed in Sarawak's cession to Great Britain in 1946, which ended Brooke Sarawak and brought citizenship to Sarawak based on ''jus soli'' to the Chinese, who were regarded as immigrants.\n\nLeaving government service in 1948, Ong entered business under the tutelage of [[Wee Kheng Chiang|Datuk Amar Wee Kheng Chiang]], his father-in-law, who appointed him manager of the family\u2019s Bian Chiang Bank, today known as [[CIMB]] Group, devoting himself to business and banking.\n\n===Rise to politics===\nIn the mid-1950s, Ong Kee Hui started his political career as a nominated member of the Council Negri (State Legislative Council), and he was elected to the Kuching Municipal Council as the Mayor of Kuching and an unofficial member of the Supreme Council (State Cabinet) as Minister of Technology, Research and Local Government.\n\nThe \u201cdivide and rule\u201d method of the British encouraged the communal polarisation of Sarawak politics, something that he and his contemporaries viewed with alarm as boding ill for future Sarawak democracy. To counter this trend, Ong, together with Datuk Amar [[Stephen Yong Kuet Tze]] and colleagues, established the [[Sarawak United People's Party|Sarawak United People's Party (SUPP)]] as Sarawak's first political party in 1959.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinmayer|first=Otto|date=2000|title=Review of Ong Kee Hui's memoirs|url=http://www.ikanlundu.com/Swak_memoirs.html|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume= lxxiii part 1|pages=126\u2013129.|via=}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Malaysia]] was proposed, Ong argued for Sarawak's independence, before joining the greater federation. The [[Sarawak United People's Party]] supported his stance for independence. Ong was also a member of the [[Malaysian Solidarity Convention]]'s Sarawak delegation in 1962.\n\nMalaysia became an independent country in 1963. In 1965, he seized the expulsion of [[Singapore]] to call for a [[referendum]] but was rejected.\n\nAfter much encouragement and pragmatism from then Deputy Prime Minister, [[Tun Abdul Razak]], he was convinced to forge political partnerships and consequently, [[Sarawak United People's Party]] joined the State Government in 1971. He served as the Minister of Local Government and Housing and Minister of Science Technology & Environment under Tun Abdul Razak's Cabinet. However, being a federal minister in Kuala Lumpur divorced him from Sarawakian grassroots politics.\n\nIn 1980, he stood down as party chairman of SUPP and retired to pen his memoirs, Footprints in Sarawak.\n\n== Spouse and Children ==\nOn 14 September 1937, he married Wee Bee Siok ({{zh|c=\u9ec3\u7f8e\u60dc|p=Hu\u00e1ng M\u011bix\u012b}}), the daughter of a successful banker and businessman, [[Wee Kheng Chiang|Datuk Wee Kheng Chiang]], in a traditional Chinese ceremony. They have eight children - two sons and six daughters.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Albert Lau. ''Southeast Asia and the Cold War.'' Routledge, 26 July 2012 pg. 129\n* Tan Sri Ong Kee Hui.
