This article focuses on the circumnavigation of [[Earth]].\n\nThe first circumnavigation of Earth was the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]], which sailed from [[Seville, Spain]] in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans.

The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a [[loop (topology)|continuous loop]] on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a [[great circle]], and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points [[antipodes|antipodal]] to each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =2 July 2012}}</ref> In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is [[spheroid|quasispheroidal]], a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are [[Arctic ice pack|practical difficulties]] in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by [[Ranulph Fiennes]].{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nThe first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship ''Victoria'', between 1519 and 1522, known as the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition]]. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery, led initially by the Portuguese [[Ferdinand Magellan]] between 1519 and 1521, and then by the Spanish [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] from 1521 to 1522. The voyage started in [[Seville]], crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition discovered the [[Strait of Magellan]], named after the fleet's captain. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way, including [[Guam]], before arriving in the [[Philippines]]. After Magellan's death in the Philippines in 1521, Elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the Indian Ocean, round the [[Cape of Good Hope]], north along the Atlantic Ocean, and back to Spain in 1522. Elcano and a small group of 18 men were the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Seafarers\u2014The Explorers| first= Richard |last=Humble| publisher= Time-Life Books| location= Alexandria, Virginia| year=1978}}</ref>\n\nApart from some scholars, it is not generally accepted that Magellan and some crew members (possibly some other Portuguese and the Malay-Sumatrese [[Enrique of Malacca]], who survived to the Philippines and [[Borneo]]) previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages, since [[Sumatra]] and [[Malacca]] (where Magellan had been twice before, in 1509 and in 1511\u20131512) lie southwest of [[Cebu]] (Philippines). If he had also been in the [[Moluccas]] islands (located southeast of Cebu) in early 1512 (dubious and controversial), he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of Earth in longitude\u2014though one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point. However, traveling west from Europe, in 1521, Magellan reached a region of Southeast Asia (in the [[Malay Archipelago]]), which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east. Magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.<ref>[http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023160813/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |date=23 October 2014 }} ''Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800'', Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay</ref>\n\nIn 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] sent [[Francis Drake]] to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'', which he renamed ''Golden Hind'' mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed through the Strait of Magellan.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}</ref><ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain's northernmost claim in Alta California, which is known as [[Drakes Bay]], California. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in September 1580, becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation.\n\nFor the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by [[Ulysses S. Grant]], became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition, quicker and safer.<ref name=\"nzh\"/>\n\n==Nautical==\nThe nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran [[IDEC 3]]. The record was established by six sailors: [[Francis Joyon]], [[Alex Pella]], Cl\u00e9ment Surtel, Gw\u00e9nol\u00e9 Gahinet, S\u00e9bastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm; who wrote themselves into history books on 26 January 2017, by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.sailspeedrecords.com/news/216-wssr-newsletter-no-281-idec-around-the-world-outright-07-02-17|title = The WSSR Council announces the establishment of a new World Recordwork | work = World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSR) |accessdate =2017-02-07}}</ref> The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.\n\n===Wind powered===\n[[File:CircumnavigationByTrades.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Panama Canal]] is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nThe map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a [[sailing]] circumnavigation of the world by the [[trade wind]]s and the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a [[great circle]], and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:CircumnavigationByCapes.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nIn [[yacht racing]], a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles (40,000&nbsp;km) in length which crosses the [[equator]], crosses every [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] and finishes in the same port as it starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |title=ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore, sec. 26.1.a, Record Courses |publisher=Sailspeedrecords.com |accessdate=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717063258/http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second map on the right shows the route of the [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for [[square-rig]] vessels due to the square rig's dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern [[Bermuda rig]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor [[around the world sailing record]]s, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63\u00b0S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track.

Typically, these voyages begin in [[New York City]] or [[Southampton]], and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around [[Cape Horn]]. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around [[Cape of Good Hope]] and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes<ref>https://www.uimpowerboating.com/Records1.aspx</ref> was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran [[Earthrace]] which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction.\n\n==Aviation==\nSince the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] Flight One (and later [[United Airlines]] Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple.\n\nThe [[First aerial circumnavigation|first successful attempt]] to circumnavigate the planet by air occurred in 1924, flown by aviators of the [[U.S. Army Air Service]] in a quartet of [[Douglas World Cruiser]] biplanes.\n\nThe first [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the [[rigid airship]] [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']], which did so in 1929.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nAviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the [[jet stream]]s, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record. Thus, for example, [[Steve Fossett]]'s global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least {{convert|36770|km|nmi}} long (which is approximately the length of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section 2: Powered Aerodynes: Speed around the world non-stop and non-refuelled |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] |format=PDF |date=January 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211204923/http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |archive-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ballooning, which is totally at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed. The course must cross all meridians, and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles, chosen by the pilot, having radii of {{convert|3335.85|km|mi}} and enclosing the poles (though not necessarily centred on them).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/documents/sportingcode/sc1 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section&nbsp;1: Aerostats: Around-the-World Records

This article focuses on the circumnavigation of [[Earth]].\n\nThe first circumnavigation of Earth was the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano expedition]], which sailed from [[Seville, Spain]] in 1519 and returned in 1522, after crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], and [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] oceans. Since the rise of [[commercial aviation]] in the late 20th century, circumnavigating Earth is straightforward, usually taking days instead of years.<ref name=\"nzh\">{{cite web|last1=Howie|first1=Cherie|title=Kiwi airline exec breaks record for world circumnavigation on commercial airlines|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11983099|website=New Zealand Herald|publisher=New Zealand Media and Entertainment|accessdate=17 June 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617200711/https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11983099|archivedate=17 June 2019|date=27 January 2018}}</ref> Today, the challenge of circumnavigating Earth has shifted towards human and technological endurance, speed, and [[List of circumnavigations#Miscellaneous|less conventional methods]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''circumnavigation'' is a noun formed from the verb ''circumnavigate'', from the past participle of the [[Latin]] verb ''[[:wikt:circumnavigare#Latin|circumnavigare]]'', from ''circum'' \"around\" + ''navigare'' \"to sail\" (see further [[Navigation#Etymology|Navigation \u00a7 Etymology]]).<ref>{{OEtymD|circumnavigate}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nA person walking completely around either pole will cross all [[meridian (geography)|meridians]], but this is not generally considered a \"circumnavigation\". The path of a true (global) circumnavigation forms a [[loop (topology)|continuous loop]] on the surface of Earth separating two regions of comparable area. A basic definition of a global circumnavigation would be a route which covers roughly a [[great circle]], and in particular one which passes through at least one pair of points [[antipodes|antipodal]] to each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expedition360.com/home/circumnavigation.htm |title=Definition of a Circumnavigation |publisher=Expedition360.com |date=28 September 1924 |accessdate =2 July 2012}}</ref> In practice, people use different definitions of world circumnavigation to accommodate practical constraints, depending on the method of travel. Since the planet is [[spheroid|quasispheroidal]], a trip from one Pole to the other, and back again on the other side, would technically be a circumnavigation. There are [[Arctic ice pack|practical difficulties]] in such a voyage, although it was successfully undertaken in the early 1980s by [[Ranulph Fiennes]].{{citation needed|date = December 2019}}\n\n==History==\nThe first single voyage of global circumnavigation was that of the ship ''Victoria'', between 1519 and 1522, known as the [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition]]. It was a Castilian (Spanish) voyage of discovery, led initially by the Portuguese [[Ferdinand Magellan]] between 1519 and 1521, and then by the Spanish [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] from 1521 to 1522. The voyage started in [[Seville]], crossed the Atlantic Ocean, and after several stopovers rounded the southern tip of South America, where the expedition discovered the [[Strait of Magellan]], named after the fleet's captain. It then continued across the Pacific, discovering a number of islands on its way, including [[Guam]], before arriving in the [[Philippines]]. After Magellan's death in the Philippines in 1521, Elcano took command of the expedition and continued the journey across the Indian Ocean, round the [[Cape of Good Hope]], north along the Atlantic Ocean, and back to Spain in 1522. Elcano and a small group of 18 men were the only members of the expedition to make the full circumnavigation.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Seafarers\u2014The Explorers| first= Richard |last=Humble| publisher= Time-Life Books| location= Alexandria, Virginia| year=1978}}</ref>\n\nApart from some scholars, it is not generally accepted that Magellan and some crew members (possibly some other Portuguese and the Malay-Sumatrese [[Enrique of Malacca]], who survived to the Philippines and [[Borneo]]) previously completed a full circumnavigation on several voyages, since [[Sumatra]] and [[Malacca]] (where Magellan had been twice before, in 1509 and in 1511\u20131512) lie southwest of [[Cebu]] (Philippines). If he had also been in the [[Moluccas]] islands (located southeast of Cebu) in early 1512 (dubious and controversial), he completed and clearly exceeded an entire circumnavigation of Earth in longitude\u2014though one circumnavigation in the strict sense implies a return to the same exact point. However, traveling west from Europe, in 1521, Magellan reached a region of Southeast Asia (in the [[Malay Archipelago]]), which he had reached on previous voyages traveling east. Magellan thereby achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.<ref>[http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023160813/http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/westtech/circumn.htm |date=23 October 2014 }} ''Circumnavigations of the Globe to 1800'', Steve Dutch, University of Wisconsin-Green Bay</ref>\n\nIn 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] sent [[Francis Drake]] to start an expedition against the Spanish along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Drake set out from Plymouth, England in November 1577, aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'', which he renamed ''Golden Hind'' mid-voyage. In September 1578, the ship passed through the Strait of Magellan.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}</ref><ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> In June 1579, Drake landed somewhere north of Spain's northernmost claim in Alta California, which is known as [[Drakes Bay]], California. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in September 1580, becoming the first commander to lead an entire circumnavigation.\n\nFor the wealthy, long voyages around the world, such as was done by [[Ulysses S. Grant]], became possible in the 19th century, and the two World Wars moved vast numbers of troops around the planet. However, it was the rise of commercial aviation in the late 20th century that made circumnavigation, when compared to the Magellan\u2013Elcano expedition, quicker and safer.<ref name=\"nzh\"/>\n\n==Nautical==\nThe nautical global and fastest circumnavigation record is currently held by a wind-powered vessel, the trimaran [[IDEC 3]]. The record was established by six sailors: [[Francis Joyon]], [[Alex Pella]], Cl\u00e9ment Surtel, Gw\u00e9nol\u00e9 Gahinet, S\u00e9bastien Audigane and Bernard Stamm; who wrote themselves into history books on 26 January 2017, by circumnavigating the globe in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.sailspeedrecords.com/news/216-wssr-newsletter-no-281-idec-around-the-world-outright-07-02-17|title = The WSSR Council announces the establishment of a new World Recordwork | work = World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSR) |accessdate =2017-02-07}}</ref> The absolute speed sailing record around the world followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Equator, South Atlantic Ocean, Southern Ocean, South Atlantic Ocean, Equator, North Atlantic Ocean route in an easterly direction.\n\n===Wind powered===\n[[File:CircumnavigationByTrades.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical modern sailing circumnavigation, via the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Panama Canal]] is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nThe map on the right shows, in red, a typical, non-competitive, route for a [[sailing]] circumnavigation of the world by the [[trade wind]]s and the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route roughly approximates a [[great circle]], and passes through two pairs of antipodal points. This is a route followed by many [[Cruising (maritime)|cruising]] sailors, going in the western direction; the use of the trade winds makes it a relatively easy sail, although it passes through a number of zones of calms or light winds.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\n[[File:CircumnavigationByCapes.png|thumb|300px|right|The route of a typical yacht racing circumnavigation is shown in red; its antipodes are shown in yellow.]]\n\nIn [[yacht racing]], a round-the-world route approximating a great circle would be quite impractical, particularly in a non-stop race where use of the Panama and Suez Canals would be impossible. Yacht racing therefore defines a world circumnavigation to be a passage of at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles (40,000&nbsp;km) in length which crosses the [[equator]], crosses every [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] and finishes in the same port as it starts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |title=ISAF/World Sailing Speed Record Rules for individually attempted Passage Records or Performances Offshore, sec. 26.1.a, Record Courses |publisher=Sailspeedrecords.com |accessdate=2 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717063258/http://sailspeedrecords.com/the-courses-offshore.html |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second map on the right shows the route of the [[Vend\u00e9e Globe]] round-the-world race in red; overlaid in yellow are the points antipodal to all points on the route. It can be seen that the route does not pass through any pairs of antipodal points. Since the winds in the higher southern latitudes predominantly blow west-to-east it can be seen that there are an easier route (west-to-east) and a harder route (east-to-west) when circumnavigating by sail; this difficulty is magnified for [[square-rig]] vessels due to the square rig's dramatic lack of upwind ability when compared to a more modern [[Bermuda rig]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor [[around the world sailing record]]s, there is a rule saying that the length must be at least 21,600&nbsp;nautical miles calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63\u00b0S. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track.

Typically, these voyages begin in [[New York City]] or [[Southampton]], and proceed westward. Routes vary, either travelling through the Caribbean and then into the Pacific Ocean via the Panama Canal, or around [[Cape Horn]]. From there ships usually make their way to Hawaii, the islands of the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand, then northward to Hong Kong, South East Asia, and India. At that point, again, routes may vary: one way is through the Suez Canal and into the Mediterranean; the other is around [[Cape of Good Hope]] and then up the west coast of Africa. These cruises end in the port where they began.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nThe current mechanically powered circumnavigation record of 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes<ref>https://www.uimpowerboating.com/Records1.aspx</ref> was established by a voyage of the wave-piercing trimaran [[Earthrace]] which was completed on 27 June 2008. The voyage followed the North Atlantic Ocean, Panama Canal, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Suez Canal, Mediterranean Sea route in a westerly direction.\n\n==Aviation==\nSince the development of commercial aviation, there are regular routes that circle the globe, such as [[Pan American World Airways|Pan American]] Flight One (and later [[United Airlines]] Flight One). Today planning such a trip through commercial flight connections is simple.\n\nThe [[First aerial circumnavigation|first successful attempt]] to circumnavigate the planet by air occurred in 1924, flown by aviators of the [[U.S. Army Air Service]] in a quartet of [[Douglas World Cruiser]] biplanes.\n\nThe first [[Aerostat|lighter-than-air]] aircraft of any type to circumnavigate under its own power was the [[rigid airship]] [[LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin|LZ 127 ''Graf Zeppelin'']], which did so in 1929.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nAviation records take account of the wind circulation patterns of the world; in particular the [[jet stream]]s, which circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres without crossing the equator. There is therefore no requirement to cross the equator, or to pass through two antipodal points, in the course of setting a round-the-world aviation record. Thus, for example, [[Steve Fossett]]'s global circumnavigation by balloon was entirely contained within the southern hemisphere.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}\n\nFor powered aviation, the course of a round-the-world record must start and finish at the same point and cross all meridians; the course must be at least {{convert|36770|km|nmi}} long (which is approximately the length of the [[Tropic of Cancer]]). The course must include set control points at latitudes outside the [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section 2: Powered Aerodynes: Speed around the world non-stop and non-refuelled |publisher=[[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale]] |format=PDF |date=January 2016 |accessdate=2 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160211204923/http://www.fai.org/downloads/gac/SC2 |archive-date=11 February 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ballooning, which is totally at the mercy of the winds, the requirements are even more relaxed. The course must cross all meridians, and must include a set of checkpoints which are all outside of two circles, chosen by the pilot, having radii of {{convert|3335.85|km|mi}} and enclosing the poles (though not necessarily centred on them).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/documents/sportingcode/sc1 |title=FAI Sporting Code Section&nbsp;1: Aerostats: Around-the-World Records

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare. Medium-sized pony mares are preferred to produce riding zonies, but zebras have been crossed with smaller pony breeds such as the [[Shetland pony|Shetland]], resulting in so-called \"Zetlands\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Crisis-hit farm welcomes its gift forse|date= 27 June 2001 |quote=it could be a zorse perhaps, a fony, or maybe a shebra or a zetland.

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nDonkeys and wild equids have different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on the species). In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K. Benirschke |display-authors=et al | pmid=14171168 | doi = 10.1007/BF00326911 | pages = 1\u201313}}</ref> Horses have 64 chromosomes, while most zebroids end up with 54 chromosomes.\nJust as male mules and hinnies are infertile so are male zebroids. And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\".

In most cases, the sire is a zebra [[stallion]]. Offspring of a donkey sire and zebra dam called a '''donkra''' or '''zebra hinny''' and offspring of a horse sire and a zebra dam called a '''hebra''' do exist, but are rare and are usually sterile and infertile. Zebroids have been bred since the 19th century. [[Charles Darwin]] noted several zebra hybrids in his works.\n\n==Types==\nZebroid is the term generally used for all zebra hybrids. The different hybrids are generally named using a [[portmanteau]] of the [[wikt:sire#Noun|sire]]'s name and the [[wikt:dam#Noun 2|dam]]'s name. Generally, no distinction is made as to which zebra species is used. Many times, when zebras are crossbred, they develop some form of [[dwarfism]]. Breeding of different branches of the equine family, which does not occur in the wild, generally results in infertile offspring. The combination of sire and dam also affects the offspring [[phenotype]].\n\nA zorse is the offspring of a [[zebra]] stallion and a horse [[mare]]. This cross is also called a zebrula, zebrule, or zebra mule. The rarer reverse pairing is sometimes called a hebra, horbra, zebrinny, zebret, or zebra hinny. Like most other animal hybrids, the zorse is sterile.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150|title= Zorse Breed Description |work= Breeding References|publisher= EquinePost |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710195153/http://www.equinepost.com/resources/breeds/showBreed.asp?ID=150 |archivedate=2011-07-10}}</ref>\n\nA zony is the offspring of a zebra stallion and a pony mare.

Like [[mule]]s and [[hinny]]s, however, they are generally genetically unable to breed, due to an odd number of chromosomes disrupting [[meiosis]].\n\n==Genetics==\nDonkeys and wild equids have different numbers of [[chromosome]]s. A donkey has 62 chromosomes; the zebra has between 32 and 46 (depending on the species). In spite of this difference, viable hybrids are possible, provided the gene combination in the hybrid allows for embryonic development to birth. A hybrid has a number of chromosomes somewhere in between. The chromosome difference makes female hybrids poorly fertile and male hybrids generally sterile, due to a phenomenon called [[Haldane's rule]]. The difference in chromosome number is most likely due to horses having two longer chromosomes that contain similar gene content to four zebra chromosomes.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Chromosome Studies of a Donkey-Grevy Zebra Hybrid | journal = Chromosoma | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1964 | author = K.

And just as female mules and hinnies only very rarely produce offspring the same appears to be true of zebroids. Considering zebroids are much less common as mules the chances of a fertile zebroid mare are very slim. Only ONE case of such a mare was reported : The zebroid mare of a zebra mare x draft horse stallion produced a foal when she was bred back to her sire but the foal died of lightning and she did not survive it much longer.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:Z\u00e9brulecouch\u00e9.jpg|thumb|left|A zorse]]\nZebroids physically resemble their nonzebra parent, but are striped like a zebra. The stripes generally do not cover the whole body, and might be confined to the legs or spread onto parts of the body or neck. If the nonzebra parent was patterned (such as a [[Roan (horse)|roan]], [[Appaloosa]], [[Pinto horse|pinto]]/[[American Paint Horse|paint]], [[piebald]], or [[skewbald]]), this pattern might be passed down to the zebroid, in which case the stripes are usually confined to non-white areas. The alternative name \"golden zebra\" relates to the interaction of zebra striping and a horse's bay or chestnut colour to give a zebra-like black-on-bay or black-on-chestnut pattern that superficially resembles the extinct [[quagga]]. Zebra-donkey hybrids usually have a dorsal (back) stripe and a ventral (belly) stripe.\n\n[[File:Zorse.jpg|thumb|The hebra Eclyse]]\nZorses combine the zebra striping overlaid on colored areas of the hybrid's coat. Zorses are most often bred using solid-color horses. If the horse parent is piebald (black and white) or skewbald (other color and white), the zorse may inherit the dominant depigmentation genes for white patches. The [[tobiano]] (the most common white modifier found in the horse) directly interacts with the zorse coat to give the white markings. Only the nondepigmented areas will have zebra striping, resulting in a zorse with white patches and striped patches. This effect is seen in the zebroid named Eclyse (a hebra rather than a zorse) born in Stukenbrock, Germany, in 2007 to a zebra mare called Eclipse and a stallion called Ulysses.\n\nZebroids are preferred over zebras for practical uses, such as riding, because the zebra has a different body shape from a [[horse]] or [[donkey]], and consequently it is difficult to find [[Horse tack|tack]] to fit a zebra. However, a zebroid is usually more inclined to be temperamental than a [[purebred]] horse and can be difficult to handle. Zebras, being wild animals, and not domesticated like horses and donkeys, pass on their wild animal traits to their offspring.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} Zebras, while not usually very large, are extremely strong and aggressive. Similarly, zorses have a strong temperament and can be aggressive.\n\n==Historical and notable zebroids==\n[[Image:zebroidfoal.jpg|thumbnail|Zebra-horse hybrid foal with quagga-like markings, [[Walter Rothschild Zoological Museum]], [[Tring]], [[England]]]]\n\nIn 1815, Lord Morton mated a quagga stallion to a chestnut [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare. The result was a female hybrid which resembled both parents. This provoked the interest of Cossar Ewart, Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh (1882\u20131927) and a keen geneticist. Ewart crossed a zebra stallion with pony mares to investigate the theory of [[telegony (pregnancy)|telegony]], or paternal impression. In ''[[Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] mentioned four coloured drawings of hybrids between the ass and zebra. He also wrote\n<blockquote>\nIn Lord Morton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Darwin|first1=Charles|title=On the origin of species, 1859.|date=2009|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0814720585|pages=118\u2013119}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nIn his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'', Darwin described a hybrid ass-zebra specimen in the British Museum as being dappled on its flanks. He also mentioned a \"triple hybrid, from a bay mare, by a hybrid from a male ass and female zebra\" displayed at [[London Zoo]]. This would have required the zebroid sire to be fertile.\n\nDuring the South African War, the [[Boer]]s crossed Chapman's zebras with a ponies, to produce animals for transport work, chiefly for hauling guns. A specimen was captured by British forces and presented to [[King Edward VII]] by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], and was photographed by W. S. Berridge.<ref>''Wonders of Animal Life'', edited by [[John Alexander Hammerton|J. A. Hammerton]] (1930)</ref> Zebras are resistant to sleeping sickness, whereas purebred horses and ponies are not, and  zebra mules hopefully would inherit this resistance.\n\nGrevy's zebra has been crossed with the [[Somali wild ass]] in the early 20th century. [[Zorse]]s were bred by the US government and reported in ''Genetics in Relation to Agriculture'' by E. B. Babcock and R. E. Clausen (early 20th century), in an attempt to investigate inheritance and telegony. The experiments were also reported in ''The Science of Life'' by H G Wells, J Huxley, and G P Wells (around 1929).\n\nInterest in zebra crosses continued in the 1970s. In 1973, a cross between a zebra and a donkey was foaled at the Jerusalem Zoo. They called it a \"hamzab\". In the 1970s, the [[Colchester Zoo]] in England bred zedonks, at first by accident and later to create a disease-resistant riding and draft animal. The experiment was discontinued when zoos became more conservation-minded. A number of hybrids were kept at the zoo after this; the last died in 2009.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Colchester Zoo mourns the loss of Shadow the Zeedonk| url = http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| date = 3 April 2009| publisher = Colchester Zoo| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708174954/http://www.colchester-zoo.com/index.cfm?fa=news.press.detail&Press_Release_ID=244| archivedate = 8 July 2011| df = dmy-all}}</ref> One adult still remains at the tourist attraction of [[Groombridge Place]]<ref>{{cite web |title=The Enchanted Forest |url=http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |work=Groombridge Place Gardens |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729084438/http://www.groombridge.co.uk/enchanted.htm |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> near Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, various zebroids are bred as riding and draft animals, and as curiosities in circuses and smaller zoos.

[[Hurricane Maria]] made landfall as a [[Category 5 hurricane]] and crossed the island from southeast to north, causing a huge amount of physical and emotional devastation and an unprecedented [[humanitarian crisis]]. The hurricane left 95% of the island without communications, food, water and medical care, and all 3.4&nbsp;million residents lost electrical power.\n\nLike everything else on the island, schools were damaged and school were closed. A total of 164 schools were used as shelters for 9,931 people as a huge number of homes had been completely destroyed. Many of the schools that were not used as shelters were severely damaged by the hurricane, and an estimated 44 schools would never reopen.\n\n[[World Central Kitchen]] chef [[Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s]] begged Keleher to use her power to order schools to open their kitchens and cook for their communities.

Later, a school administrator explained to Andr\u00e9s that schools were required to do just that by law.<ref name=\"We Fed book\">{{cite book |first=Jos\u00e9|last=Andr\u00e9s| title=We Fed an Island: the True Story of Rebuilding Puerto Rico, One Meal at a Time| date=22 February 2018|oclc=1057000234}}</ref>\n\nOn October 23, 2017, 33 days after the storm, the [[Puerto Rico Department of Education|PRDE]] re-opened 152 schools in the regions of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] and [[Mayag\u00fcez, Puerto Rico|Mayag\u00fcez]]. The department was then able to open more schools, starting on a weekly basis and then on a daily basis. As of November 13, 2017, a total of 755 schools had been re-opened, many of them without power but with running water. Keleher had first estimated that 80% of the schools would be open by mid-November; it turned out that a total of 932 schools (84%) had re-opened by November 16.
