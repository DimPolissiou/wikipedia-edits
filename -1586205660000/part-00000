Alongside Finnish, Hungarian, and Maltese, Estonian is one of the four official [[languages of European Union]] that is not of an [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin.

This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German languages|High German]] (including [[Standard German]]). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22\u201325 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent.

The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are limited to [[proper names]] of foreign origin, and ''f'', ''z'', ''\u0161'', and ''\u017e'' appear in loanwords and foreign names only. ''\u00d6'' and ''\u00fc'' are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Swedish (when followed by 'r') and Finnish, ''\u00c4'' is pronounced [\u00e6], as in English ''mat''. The vowels \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc are clearly separate [[phonemes]] and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter ''[[\u00f5]]'' denotes {{IPA|/\u0264/}}, unrounded {{IPA|/o/}}, or a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]]. It is almost identical to the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[\u044a]] {{IPA|/\u0264\u031e/}} and the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[\u01a1]], and is also used to transcribe the Russian [[\u044b]].\n\n===Orthography===\nAlthough the Estonian [[orthography]] is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each [[grapheme]] corresponding to one [[phoneme]], there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example preservation of the morpheme in [[declension]] of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced)<!--examples needed--> and in the use of 'i' and 'j'.{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Where it is very impractical or impossible to type ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'', they are substituted with ''sh'' and ''zh'' in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the ''h'' in ''sh'' represents a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], as in ''Pasha'' (''pas-ha''); this also applies to some foreign names.\n\nModern Estonian orthography is based on the ''Newer Orthography'' created by [[Eduard Ahrens]] in the second half of the 19th{{nbsp}}century based on Finnish orthography. The ''Older Orthography'' it replaced was created in the 17th{{nbsp}}century by [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius]] and [[Johann Hornung]] based on [[German language|standard German]] orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ''ad hoc'' orthography based on [[Latin]] and [[Middle Low German]] orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography \u2014 for example, writing 'W'/'w' instead of 'V'/'v' \u2014 persisted well into the 1930s.\n\nEstonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources are often back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of \"ya\" for \"\u00e4\" (e.g. Pyarnu instead of [[P\u00e4rnu]]), \"y\" instead of \"\u00f5\" (e.g., Pylva instead of [[P\u00f5lva]]) and \"yu\" instead of \"\u00fc\" (e.g., Pyussi instead of [[P\u00fcssi]]). Even in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' one can find \"ostrov Khiuma\", where \"ostrov\" means \"island\" in Russian and \"Khiuma\" is back-transliteration from Russian instead of \"[[Hiiumaa]]\" (''Hiiumaa'' > \u0425\u0438\u0439\u0443\u043c\u0430(\u0430) > ''Khiuma'').\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Summarize|from|Estonian phonology|date=March 2015}}\n{{main article|Estonian phonology}}There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.<sup>[[Estonian phonology#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only /\u0251 e i o u/ occur as the second component.

The canonical word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beltranslations.com |title=beltranslations.com |language=ru |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have [[grammatical gender]], but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[illative]], [[inessive]], [[Elative case|elative]], [[allative]], [[adessive]], [[ablative]], [[translative]], [[terminative]], [[essive]], [[abessive]], and [[comitative]], with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for ''kollane maja'' (\"a yellow house\") is ''kollasesse majja'' (\"into a yellow house\"), but the terminative is ''kollase majani'' (\"as far as a yellow house\"). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majja'' and the [[Ostrobothnia (language)|Ostrobothnia]] dialect of Finnish ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majahan''.\n\nThe direct object of the verb appears either in the [[Accusative case|accusative]] (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects). The accusative coincides with the genitive in the singular and with nominative in the plural. Accusative vs. partitive case opposition of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] used with transitive verbs creates a [[telicity]] contrast, just as in Finnish. This is a rough equivalent of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect opposition.<!-- Most books I've seen don't use an accusative case, although I suppose the grammar would make more sense with one. However, when the verb is imperative, the opposition is between nominative and partitive. -->\n\nThe verbal system lacks a distinctive future tense<ref name=\"apj\">{{Cite journal|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=715\u2013727 |title=Language Shapes People's Time Perspective and Support for Future-Oriented Policies |last1=P\u00e9rez |first1=Efr\u00e9n O. |last2=Tavits |first2=Margit |doi=10.1111/ajps.12290 |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher=[[Midwest Political Science Association]]}}</ref> (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (the \"impersonal\").\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n{{main article|Estonian vocabulary}}\n\nAlthough the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins and the vocabulary is considered quite different from that of the Indo-European family<ref name=\":0\" />, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example.

Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). In Aavik's dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ''ex nihilo'', many of which are in common use today.

The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''y'' are limited to [[proper names]] of foreign origin, and ''f'', ''z'', ''\u0161'', and ''\u017e'' appear in loanwords and foreign names only. ''\u00d6'' and ''\u00fc'' are pronounced similarly to their equivalents in Swedish and German. Unlike in standard German but like Swedish (when followed by 'r') and Finnish, ''\u00c4'' is pronounced [\u00e6], as in English ''mat''. The vowels \u00c4, \u00d6 and \u00dc are clearly separate [[phonemes]] and inherent in Estonian, although the letter shapes come from German. The letter ''[[\u00f5]]'' denotes {{IPA|/\u0264/}}, unrounded {{IPA|/o/}}, or a [[close-mid back unrounded vowel]]. It is almost identical to the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[\u044a]] {{IPA|/\u0264\u031e/}} and the [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] [[\u01a1]], and is also used to transcribe the Russian [[\u044b]].\n\n===Orthography===\nAlthough the Estonian [[orthography]] is generally guided by phonemic principles, with each [[grapheme]] corresponding to one [[phoneme]], there are some historical and morphological deviations from this: for example preservation of the morpheme in [[declension]] of the word (writing b, g, d in places where p, k, t is pronounced)<!--examples needed--> and in the use of 'i' and 'j'.{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Where it is very impractical or impossible to type ''\u0161'' and ''\u017e'', they are substituted with ''sh'' and ''zh'' in some written texts, although this is considered incorrect. Otherwise, the ''h'' in ''sh'' represents a [[voiceless glottal fricative]], as in ''Pasha'' (''pas-ha''); this also applies to some foreign names.\n\nModern Estonian orthography is based on the ''Newer Orthography'' created by [[Eduard Ahrens]] in the second half of the 19th{{nbsp}}century based on Finnish orthography. The ''Older Orthography'' it replaced was created in the 17th{{nbsp}}century by [[Bengt Gottfried Forselius]] and [[Johann Hornung]] based on [[German language|standard German]] orthography. Earlier writing in Estonian had by and large used an ''ad hoc'' orthography based on [[Latin]] and [[Middle Low German]] orthography. Some influences of the standard German orthography \u2014 for example, writing 'W'/'w' instead of 'V'/'v' \u2014 persisted well into the 1930s.\n\nEstonian words and names quoted in international publications from Soviet sources are often back-transliterations from the Russian transliteration. Examples are the use of \"ya\" for \"\u00e4\" (e.g. Pyarnu instead of [[P\u00e4rnu]]), \"y\" instead of \"\u00f5\" (e.g., Pylva instead of [[P\u00f5lva]]) and \"yu\" instead of \"\u00fc\" (e.g., Pyussi instead of [[P\u00fcssi]]). Even in the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' one can find \"ostrov Khiuma\", where \"ostrov\" means \"island\" in Russian and \"Khiuma\" is back-transliteration from Russian instead of \"[[Hiiumaa]]\" (''Hiiumaa'' > \u0425\u0438\u0439\u0443\u043c\u0430(\u0430) > ''Khiuma'').\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Summarize|from|Estonian phonology|date=March 2015}}\n{{main article|Estonian phonology}}There are 9 vowels and 36 diphthongs, 28 of which are native to Estonian.<sup>[[Estonian phonology#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> All nine vowels can appear as the first component of a diphthong, but only /\u0251 e i o u/ occur as the second component.

The canonical word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]] (subject\u2013verb\u2013object).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.beltranslations.com |title=beltranslations.com |language=ru |access-date=2014-08-23}}</ref>\n\nIn Estonian, nouns and pronouns do not have [[grammatical gender]], but nouns and adjectives decline in fourteen cases: [[nominative]], [[genitive]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[illative]], [[inessive]], [[Elative case|elative]], [[allative]], [[adessive]], [[ablative]], [[translative]], [[terminative]], [[essive]], [[abessive]], and [[comitative]], with the case and number of the adjective(s) always agreeing with that of the noun (except in the terminative, essive, abessive and comitative, where there is agreement only for the number, the adjective being in the genitive form). Thus the illative for ''kollane maja'' (\"a yellow house\") is ''kollasesse majja'' (\"into a yellow house\"), but the terminative is ''kollase majani'' (\"as far as a yellow house\"). With respect to the Proto-Finnic language, elision has occurred; thus, the actual case marker may be absent, but the stem is changed, cf. ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majja'' and the [[Ostrobothnia (language)|Ostrobothnia]] dialect of Finnish ''maja&nbsp;\u2013 majahan''.\n\nThe direct object of the verb appears either in the [[Accusative case|accusative]] (for total objects) or in the partitive (for partial objects). The accusative coincides with the genitive in the singular and with nominative in the plural. Accusative vs. partitive case opposition of the [[Object (grammar)|object]] used with transitive verbs creates a [[telicity]] contrast, just as in Finnish. This is a rough equivalent of the perfective vs. imperfective aspect opposition.<!-- Most books I've seen don't use an accusative case, although I suppose the grammar would make more sense with one. However, when the verb is imperative, the opposition is between nominative and partitive. -->\n\nThe verbal system lacks a distinctive future tense<ref name=\"apj\">{{Cite journal|journal=[[American Journal of Political Science]] |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=715\u2013727 |title=Language Shapes People's Time Perspective and Support for Future-Oriented Policies |last1=P\u00e9rez |first1=Efr\u00e9n O. |last2=Tavits |first2=Margit |doi=10.1111/ajps.12290 |date=January 24, 2017 |publisher=[[Midwest Political Science Association]]}}</ref> (the present tense serves here) and features special forms to express an action performed by an undetermined [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] (the \"impersonal\").\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\n{{main article|Estonian vocabulary}}\n\nAlthough the Estonian and [[Germanic language]]s are of very different origins and the vocabulary is considered quite different from that of the Indo-European family<ref name=\":0\" />, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and English, for example. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one third of its vocabulary from [[Germanic languages]], mainly from Low Saxon ([[Middle Low German]]) during the period of [[History of Estonia#Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages|German rule]], and [[High German]] (including [[standard German]]).

Saareste and Raun 1965: 76). In Aavik\u2019s dictionary (1921), which lists approximately 4000 words, there are many words which were (allegedly) created ''ex nihilo'', many of which are in common use today.

In 1832 he traveled the northern [[Great Plains]] of the United States, where he became concerned about the destruction of the Indian civilization, wildlife, and wilderness as eastern settlements spread westward. He wrote, \"by some great protecting policy of government... in a magnificent park... a nation's park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their nature's beauty!\" <ref name=Shaping>The National Parks: Shaping the System; Harpers Ferry Center; U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 2004</ref>\n\nCatlin's vision had no immediate effect. In the east, romantic portrayals of nature by [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] and painters [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederick Edwin Church]] began to compete with prevailing view of wilderness as a challenge to overcome. Slowly unspoiled nature and spectacular natural areas of the West became better known, the idea of saving such places became of interest.\n\nIn California, several state leaders sought to protect [[Yosemite Valley]]. In 1864, Sen. [[John Conness]] of [[California]] sponsored an act to transfer the valley and nearby [[Mariposa Grove|Mariposa Big Tree Grove]] to the state so they might \"be used and preserved for the benefit of mankind\". President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed this act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on June 30, 1864. California was granted the valley and the grove on condition that They would \"be held for public use, resort, and recreation...inalienable for all time.\"<ref name=\"Shaping \" />\n\nThe [[Yellowstone National Park#Park creation|Yellowstone]] country was first \"officially\" explored by [[Cook\u2013Folsom\u2013Peterson Expedition|David E. Folsom]], [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition|Henry D. Washburn]], and [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871|Ferdinand Hayden]] in 1869-71. A myth evolved that near the end of the Washburn expedition, discussion around the campfire led several of the members to suggest that the area be set aside for public use and not allow it to be sold to private individuals. This myth was successfully exploited by National Park advocates but eventually was debunked by historians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schullery |first=Paul |title=Myth and History in the Creation of Yellowstone National Park |author2=Whittlesey, Lee |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=2003 |isbn=0-8032-4305-7 |pages=30\u201332 }}</ref> An early ally in promoting a public reservation was the [[Northern Pacific Railroad Company]]. They were seeking major destinations for their route through Montana.<ref name=\"Shaping \" /> In an effort to reduce poaching and other misuse of the park, the U.S. Army established a fort in the area in 1881 and began park protection, establishing a pattern that would be continued by later park rangers.\n\nIn 1875, [[Mackinac National Park]] was created on a resort island in Lake Huron in Michigan, the second national park. As at Yellowstone, the army garrison at [[Fort Mackinac]] were in charge of supervising and improving the park. The fort and the national park were turned over to state control in 1895.\n\nU.S. cavalry units took up a position in California-controlled Yosemite Park in 1891 and took over some management duties. In 1906 the park was completely taken into federal control.\n\n===National Monument line I, 1906\u20131916===\nWhile early emphasis had been on the creation of [[National Parks]], there was another movement seeking to preserve the cliff dwellings, pueblo ruins, and early missions throughout the west and southwest. Often local ranchers would try to protect these ruins from plunder, but pot-hunters vandalized many sites. The effort began in Boston and spread to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Denver]], and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], during the 1880s and 1890s. Rep. [[John Fletcher Lacey]] of [[Iowa]] and Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] of [[Massachusetts]], created the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />[[File:Devils Tower from west.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Devils Tower's westwall is a {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertical climb]]\n\nThe [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] was designed to protect antiquities and objects of scientific interest on the public domain. It authorized the [[President of the United States|President]], \"to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" that existed on public lands in the United States. The Act declared these sites to be National Monuments. It prohibited the excavation or removal of objects on Federal land unless a permit had been issued by the appropriate department.<ref name=\"Lee\" /> Between 1906 and 1933 three Federal agencies, the Departments of [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Defense|War]], initiated and administered separate groups of [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]s.\n\nPresident [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed the Antiquities Act on June 8, 1906. As early as 1889 Congress authorized the President to reserve the land on which the well known [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruin]] was located. In 1904, Dr. [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] made a review of all the Indian ruins on Federal lands in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Utah]]. He recommended many sites for protection. Based on Hewett's report and many individual request and reports from throughout the west, between 1906 and 1916 the Interior Department recommended and Presidents Roosevelt, [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed twenty National Monuments.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nOn September 24, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]] as the first National Monument. Devils Tower is a Wyoming landmark, a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} high tower of rock, visible for nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}}. It has been a guidepost and a religious site. In December of that year, three more National Monuments were created. [[El Morro National Monument|El Morro]], New Mexico, is a wayside in the rugged desert lands used by Indians settlers and travelers for centuries as a watering hole and a place to leave their marks. The site includes prehistoric [[petroglyphs]] and hundreds of inscriptions from 17th century Spanish explorers and 19th century American emigrants and settlers. [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Arizona]], is one of the best preserved cliff dwellings. [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], Arizona, is world-renowned for its petrified wood, Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Three of these original National Monuments later became the core of National Parks. Mukuntuweap became [[Zion National Park|Zion]], Sieur de Monts grew into [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]], and Petrified Forest which was expanded by Congress to become a National Park of the same name. Three of the smaller areas were later abolished, those being [[Lewis and Clark Caverns]], Shoshone Cavern, and [[Papago Park|Papago Saguaro]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Mineral Springs line, 1832\u20131916===\n[[File:Quapaw Baths HABS 1984.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Quapaw Baths from HABS image]]Mineral springs have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. By 1800, places like [[Saratoga Springs]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Berkeley Springs]] and [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]], [[West Virginia]], and [[French Lick]], [[Indiana]], were becoming popular American resorts. In 1832 [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], was set aside as a Federal reservation to protect 47 hot springs. In 1870 the area was protected by Congress as the [[Hot Springs Reservation]] and in 1921 it was made a National Park. [[Hot Springs National Park]] is a health resort and spa rather than a scenic area.\n\nIn 1902 the Federal Government purchased 32 mineral springs near [[Sulphur, Oklahoma]], from the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indians. The Sulphur Springs Reservation was placed under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior who shortly acquired some additional land. In 1906 Congress created [[Platt National Park]] which included the Sulphur Springs Reservation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n==Establishment, 1916==\nForty-four years after the establishment of [[Yellowstone]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] created the [[National Park Service]] on August 25, 1916. For years [[J. Horace McFarland]], President of the [[American Civic Association]]; Secretaries of the Interior [[Walter L. Fisher|Walter Fisher]] and [[Franklin K. Lane]]; Presidents [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]; [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]].; Representatives [[William Kent (U.S. Congressman)|William Kent]] and [[John E. Raker]] of California; Senator [[Reed Smoot]] of Utah; [[Stephen T. Mather]] and [[Horace M. Albright]] had been seeking the creation of separate agency to manage the National Parks and Monuments.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n==Reorganization of 1933==\nOn June 11, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed Executive Order 6166 which consolidated all National Parks and National Monuments, National Military Parks, the eleven National Cemeteries, National Memorials, and the National Capital Parks into a single National Park System. The National Park Service was directed to oversee all of these areas.<ref>Horace M. Albright, Origins of National Park Service Administration of Historic Sites, [[Eastern National Park and Monument Association]], 1971</ref>\nThere were three significant results of this action:\n# it made the National Park Service the sole Federal agency responsible for all Federally owned public parks, monuments, and memorials;\n# it enlarged the National Park System idea to include at least four types of areas not clearly included in the System concept before 1933 \u2014 [[National Memorials]], like the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]; [[National Military Park]]s, like [[Gettysburg National Military Park|Gettysburg]] and [[Antietam National Battlefield|Antietam]] with their adjoining [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]]; [[National Capital Parks]], a great urban park system as old as the nation itself; and the first recreational area \u2014 [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]];\n# the reorganization substantially increased the number of areas in the System by adding 12 natural areas in 9 western states and [[Alaska]] and 57 historical areas located in 17 predominantly eastern states and the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Capital Parks line, 1790\u20131933===\n[[File:The Mall in WDC.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The Mall]]National Capital Parks are the oldest parks in the National Park System. These parks began with the founding of the [[District of Columbia]] in 1790. The President appointed three Federal Commissioners to design a district {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} square on the Potomac River for the permanent seat of the Federal Government. The current National Capital Parks office is a direct lineal descendant of the original office established by the first commissioners of the District of Columbia in 1791.<ref>Cornelius W. Heine, A History of National Capital Parks (Washington: National Park Service, 1953)</ref>\n\nPresident [[George Washington]] engaged Major [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] to design the new capital city. The [[Washington D.C.#Cityscape|L'Enfant Plan]] proposed a city of beauty. The plan was designed around a series of boulevards, parks and [[National Mall|The Mall]]. Additionally, L'Enfant envisaged a Congress Garden and a President's Park; embellished with statues, columns, or obelisks; grand fountains; an equestrian statue of Washington; a Naval Column; and a zero milestone.\n\n[[Rock Creek Park]] was authorized on September 27, 1890, two days after [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and three days before [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. Congress carried over some of the language of the [[Yellowstone Act]] into all three acts. Like Yellowstone, [[Rock Creek Park]] was \"dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States,\" where all timber, animals, and curiosities were to be retained \"in their natural condition, as nearly as possible.\" Though not a 'National Park', Rock Creek Park is a major urban park of the nation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Memorials line, 1776\u20131933===\n[[File:WashingtonMonumentTidalBasin.JPG|thumb|300 px|left|Washington Monument]]The first memorial was authorized by the [[Continental Congress]] on January 25, 1776, to honor General [[Richard Montgomery]], killed during an assault on the heights of [[Quebec]] in the midst of a snowstorm on the night of December 31, 1775. Montgomery commanded New York troops sent a few months before on an expedition designed to win Canada to the Revolutionary cause. It failed before Quebec, and Montgomery, became one of the first Revolutionary generals to lose his life on the field of battle. The Montgomery Memorial is not a part of the National Park System. But the chapel where it is located, St. Paul's Chapel, is a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\nThe Continental Congress climaxed its commemorative actions in August 1783 by resolving \"that an equestrian statue of General Washington be erected where the residence of Congress shall be established.\" The equestrian statue of Washington is executed by Clark Mills, placed in [[Washington Circle]] on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], and dedicated in 1859.\n\nWhen the centennial of Washington's birth came in 1832 with no satisfactory monument to in the National Capital, [[George Watterston]], [[Librarian of Congress]], and other civic leaders organized the [[Washington Monument]] Society, to erect an appropriate monument from private subscriptions. In 1848 Congress transferred a site on the Mall to the Society, and the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4. Slow progress was made worse by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. When the nation's first centennial came around in 1876 the Washington Monument was only a third completed. The [[United States Congress]] passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the Monument and site to the United States for completion and maintenance as a National Memorial. The Washington Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885.\n\nIn 1933 these National Memorials were added to the [[National Park System]] and the National Memorial function assigned to the National Park Service, except [[Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial|Perry's Victory Memorial]], which was administered by a commission until it was added to the System in 1936. Also, the fiscal functions of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission were assigned to the [[National Park Service]] in 1933 and the Memorial itself in 1938.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Military Parks line, 1781\u20131933===\n[[File:Cowpens225-2.JPG|thumb|left|300 px|Battle of Cowpens Reenactment, 225th anniversary, January 14, 2006]]The National Military Park line, including early battlefield monuments, began in 1781. Between 1890 and 1933 the War Department developed it into a National Military Park System. In 1933, there were twenty areas, 11 National Military Parks and 9 National Battlefield Sites.\nThe line started on October 29, 1781, when the [[Continental Congress]] authorized the first official on-site battlefield monument. It resolved: \"That the United States in Congress assembled, will cause to be erected at York, in Virginia, a marble column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United States and His Most Christian Majesty; and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the surrender....\"\nIn 1823 in [[Boston]]; [[Daniel Webster]], [[Edward Everett]], and other prominent citizens formed the Bunker Hill Battle Monument Association to save part of the historic field and erect on it a great commemorative monument. The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1825. During the Revolutionary Centennial years, 1876\u201383, Congress appropriated federal funds to match local funds for Revolutionary battle monuments, and through this means imposing monuments were erected at [[Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site|Bennington Battlefield]], Vermont; [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], and [[Battle of Oriskany|Oriskany]], New York; [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], South Carolina; [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], New Jersey; and [[Battle of Groton Heights|Groton]], Connecticut. Of these, Cowpens is now a unit in the National Park System, and Bunker Hill, Bennington, Oriskany, and Monmouth are [[National Historic Landmarks]].\nApril 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, [[Pennsylvania]] chartered the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] Memorial Association to commemorate \"the great deeds of valor... and the signal events which render these battlegrounds illustrious.\" This association was among the earliest historic preservation organizations in the country. By 1890 it had acquired several hundred acres of land on the battlefield including areas in the vicinity of Spangler's Spring, the Wheatfield, Little Round Top, and the Peach Orchard as well as the small white frame house General Meade had used as headquarters.\n\nWith interest and support from both North and South Congress decided to go beyond the former battlefield monument concept to authorize the first four National Military Parks \u2014 [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga & Chattanooga]] in 1890, [[Shiloh National Military Park|Shiloh]] in 1894, [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg]] in 1895, and [[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg]] in 1899. These areas were not selected at random but constituted, almost from the beginning, a rational system, designed to preserve major battlefields for historical and professional study and as lasting memorials to the great armies of both sides.\n\nThe National Military Park System was approaching maturity under the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in 1933 when all these battlefields were transferred to the National Park Service to become a significant and unique element in the National Park System.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\nAll of the exhibits are permanent, and will always be shown in the museum.\n\n===National Cemetery line, 1867\u20131933===\n[[File:Gettysburg national cemetery img 4164.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Gettysburg National Cemetery]]The [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]] in the National Park System are closely related to the National Military Parks. The [[battle of Gettysburg]] was scarcely over when Governor Andrew Y. Curtin ([[Pennsylvania]]) hastened to the field to assist local residents in caring for the dead or dying. More than 6,000 soldiers had been killed in action, and among 21,000 wounded hundreds more died each day. Initially interred in improvised graves on the battlefield, Curtin approved plans for a Soldier's National Cemetery.\n\n[[William Saunders (botanist)|William Saunders]] planned [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]]. He enclosed it with a massive stone wall, the lawns were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were laid out in a great semicircle, state by state, around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.\n\nCongress recognized the importance of honoring and caring for the remains of the war dead by enacting general legislation in 1867 which provided for a system of National Cemeteries developed by the War Department. Eleven of the National Cemeteries established under that authority were added to the National Park System in 1933. The act of 1867 also provided authority for preserving an important battlefield of the Indian wars when, on January 29, 1879, the Secretary of War designated \"The National Cemetery of Custer's Battlefield Reservation.\"<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Monument line II, 1910\u20131933; War Department===\nThe [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] authorized the President to proclaim National Monuments not only on western public lands but on any lands owned or controlled by the United States.

In 1916 these two monuments formed the nucleus for [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].\n\nFourteen of the other Department of Agriculture National Monuments were established to preserve \"scientific objects\". Moved by a report of plans to build an electric railway along its rim, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed [[Grand Canyon National Monument]] on lands within the [[Grand Canyon National Forest]], [[Arizona]], on January 11, 1908.

At the program's peak in 1935, the Service had 600 CCC camps, 118 of them assigned to National Park System areas and 482 to State Parks, employing approximately 120,000 enrollees and 6,000 professionally trained supervisors.\n\nBy mid-century, a great and growing backlog of deferred park maintenance and development projects, posed vast new problems for the Service and System. It was an era marked by the dramatic inauguration and prosecution of [[Mission 66]], the emergence of a national \"crisis in outdoor recreation,\" creation of the [[Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission]] and the [[Bureau of Outdoor Recreation]], and mounting national concern for better preservation of America's vanishing wilderness.\n\nBetween the Reorganization of 1933 and the Reorganization of 1964, 102 areas were added to the System as defined today, increasing the total number from 137 to 239 The distribution of the new areas among categories is significant. Of the new additions, 11 were \"Natural Areas\", increasing their number from 58 to 69 or 19%. Seventy-five were \"Historical Areas\", increasing their number from 77 to 152 or 96%. Fifteen were \"Recreation Areas\", increasing their number from one to 16, or 1500%. It is clear that during this period the growth rate for Natural Areas noticeably diminished from previous levels and by comparison with the rate for other categories, even though very important additions of natural lands were still being made. On the other hand, the growth rates for Historical and Recreation Areas accelerated sharply. It took the Service a generation, from 1933 to 1964, to assimilate these 102 diverse new areas and the 71 areas added by the Reorganization of 1933 and incorporate them securely into one National Park System.\n\n===Natural areas, 1933\u20131966===\n[[File:Olympic National Park coast.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Olympic National Park (Pacific Coast section)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

It was [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], however, who rescued Jackson Hole. In 1926 he visited the area and discovered the cheap commercial development, on private lands, in the midst of superlative natural beauty. There were dance halls, hot dog stands, filling stations, rodeo grand stands, and billboards, blocking the view of the Teton Range.\n\n[[File:Barns grand tetons.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Grand Teton National Park]]Rockefeller began a land acquisition program. In a few years he held over {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]]. He offered these lands as a gift to the United States. Meanwhile, opposition developed among cattlemen, dude ranchers, packers, hunters, timber interests, and local Forest Service officials. By 1943, there was still no park legislation. Rockefeller indicated he might dispose of the property if no action was pending. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the Jackson Hole National Monument, consolidating {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} donated by Rockefeller with {{convert|179000|acre|km2}} withdrawn from [[Teton National Forest]]. Thus, [[Grand Teton National Park]] was created.\n\nPresident Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism which had been brewing for years among western members of Congress. Rep. [[Frank A. Barrett]] of [[Wyoming]] and others introduced bills to abolish the monument and to repeal Section 2 of the [[Antiquities Act]] containing the President's authority to proclaim National Monuments. A bill to abolish the monument passed Congress in 1944 but was vetoed by President Roosevelt. The President noted in his veto that Presidents of both political parties, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt, had established ample precedents by proclaiming 82 National Monuments, seven of which were larger than Jackson Hole. The proclamation was nevertheless also contested in court, where it was strongly defended by the Departments of [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]] and upheld. A compromise was worked out and embodied in legislation approved by President [[Harry S Truman]] on September 14, 1950. It combined [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] and the old Grand Teton National Park in a \"new Grand Teton National Park\" containing some {{convert|298000|acre|km2}}, with special provisions regarding taxes and hunting. It also prohibited establishing or enlarging National Parks or Monuments in Wyoming in the future except by express authorization of Congress.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Historical areas, 1933\u20131966===\n[[File:Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts, July 2005.JPG|thumb|right|Old North Bridge, [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in [[Massachusetts]]]]\nSeventy-five Historical Areas were added to the National Park System between 1933 and 1964, including nine National Historic Sites and one International Park in non-federal ownership. Areas represented nine historic themes: I. ''The Original Inhabitants'' (6); II. ''European Exploration & Settlement'' (12): III. ''Development of the English Colonies'', 1700-1775 (2); IV. ''Major American Wars'' (10): V. ''Political and Military Affairs'' (16); VI. ''Westward Expansion'' 1763-1898 (15); VII ''America At Work'' (9): VIII ''The Contemplative Society'' (0); IX ''Society and Social Conscience'' (5).\n\nMuch of this would not have happened without the [[Historic Sites Act]] of 1935, a logical follow-up to the ''Reorganization of 1933''. On November 10, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited his friend and neighbor, Major Gist Blair, to give consideration \"to some kind of plan which would coordinate the broad relationship of the Federal Government to State and local interest in the maintenance of historic sources and places throughout the country.\n\nThe Act declared \"that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States'.\" This new and greatly broadened national policy has been the cornerstone of the Federal Government's historic preservation program ever since 1935, reaffirmed both in the Act of October 26, 1949, which created the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], and in the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]]. To carry out the policy, the Act assigned broad powers, duties and functions to the Secretary of the Interior to be exercised through the National Park Service, among them:\n# make a national survey of historic and archaeological sites, buildings, and objects to determine which have \"exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States;\"\n# acquire real or personal property for the purpose of the Act;\n# contract or make cooperative agreements with states, municipal subdivisions, corporations, associations, or individuals to preserve historic properties.\nThe Act established an Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments.\n\n[[File:The Old Courthouse, Saint Louis, Missouri.JPG|thumb|right|The Old Courthouse, part of the [[Gateway Arch National Park]] in [[Missouri]]]]\nSome of the most important historical additions to the system between 1933 and 1964 are almost lost to sight in this long thematic list. [[Gateway Arch National Park]], at first known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, was the first National Historic Site established under authority of the Historic Sites Act. More importantly, its 37 square blocks embraced a key urban area on the historic St. Louis waterfront \u2014 the first major effort of the NPS, after [[National Capital Parks]], to conserve and develop a large and important urban historic site. Some architectural monuments, including the Old St. Louis Post Office and the Cathedral, have been carefully preserved, but the main feature of the area is the only major national memorial of modern design in the United States, and one of a small number in the world \u2014 [[Eero Saarinen]]'s stainless steel Arch.\n\nIn 1948 Congress authorized another major urban project, the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], the most important historical area in the United States, embracing Independence Hall and Square, Congress Hall, Carpenters Hall, and many other sites and buildings associated with independence and the establishment of a government under the Constitution. The method of analyzing complex urban problems was used in Boston, where it led to authorization of [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in 1959 and other sites, including the [[Bunker Hill Monument]], [[Faneuil Hall]], and the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old Boston State House]]. A commission was established for [[New York City]], where a complex of urban monuments were added, including [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], [[Castle Clinton]], [[Grant Memorial]], [[Hamilton Grange]], [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|Theodore Roosevelt's Birthplace]], and [[Sagamore Hill]], to the previously authorized [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], whose boundaries were extended to include [[Ellis Island]].\n\nThe [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] was organized in 1933 upon the initiative of [[Charles E. Peterson]] of the [[National Park Service]] in cooperation with officials of the Library of Congress and the American Institute of Architects. Since 1933 the HABS has gathered more than 30,000 measured drawings, 40,000 photographs, and 13,000 pages of documentation for more than 13,000 of the Nation's historic buildings.\n\n[[File:Ellis Island Hall Interior.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ellis Island]]'s main hall]].\nThe National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings was organized after passage of the Historic Sites Act in 1935. Beginning in 1960, the responsibilities of this Survey staff were extended to include recommendation of an important series of National Historic Landmarks, officially designated by the Secretary of the Interior. On October 9, 1960 Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton announced the first official list of 92 historic sites and buildings eligible for designation as [[National Historic Landmarks]]. {{see also| National Register of Historic Places}}\n\nThe Inter-Agency Archaeological Salvage Program was organized by the National Park Service in 1946 at the request of the Committee for Recovery of Archaeological Remains to coordinate the salvage of irreplaceable pre-historic and historic Indian artifacts from projected reservoir sites in river valleys throughout the United States, before flooding. This program, which has been conducted for a quarter of a century in cooperation with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and universities, museums, and research institutions throughout the country, has enormously deepened knowledge of American prehistory.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Recreation areas, 1933\u20131966===\nThe Service responded to the emerging social and economic forces of the New Deal era, by expanding its cooperative relationships with the States, securing enactment of the comprehensive Park, Parkway and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936, and initiating four new types of Federal park areas \u2014 [[National Parkway]]s, [[National Recreation Area]]s, [[National Seashore]]s and [[Recreational Demonstration Area]]s. By the end of this period, fifteen of the over 50 such areas remained under the administration of the National Park Service. Because they had much in common, they were collectively designated Recreation Areas in the Reorganization of 1964.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''National Parkways'''\n* 1933 [[Blue Ridge Parkway|Blue Ridge]], VA-NC\n* 1934 [[Natchez Trace]], MS-AL-TN\n* 1949 [[Suitland Parkway|Suitland]], DC-MD\n\n'''National Seashores'''\n* 1937 [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore|Cape Hatteras]], NC\n* 1961 [[Cape Cod National Seashore|Cape Cod]], MA\n* 1962 [[Point Reyes National Seashore|Point Reyes]], CA\n* 1962 [[Padre Island National Seashore|Padre Island]], TX\n* 1965 [[Assateague Island National Seashore|Assateague Island]], MD-VA\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Recreational Demonstration Areas'''\n* 1936 [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], MD\n* 1936 [[Prince William Forest Park]], VA\n\n'''Reservoir-related Recreation Areas'''\n* 1936 [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]], AZ-NV\n* 1946 [[Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area|Coulee Dam]], WA\n* 1952 Shadow Mountain, CO\n* 1958 [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]], AZ-UT\n* 1962 [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area|Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity]], CA\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[File:Grand Coulee Dam panorama.jpg|thumb|900 px|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area]]\n\nThe origin of Recreation Areas as a category in the National Park System stemmed in important part from widened responsibilities assigned to the Service beginning in the 1930s. A central feature of these new responsibilities was administration of hundreds of [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps located in State Parks. The [[National Park Service]] had actively encouraged the state park movement ever since [[Stephen Tyng Mather]] helped organize the National Conference on State Parks at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1921. It was natural for the Service to be asked to assume national direction of [[s:Executive Order 7034|Emergency Conservation Work]] in state parks when that program was launched in 1933. Fortunately for the Service an exceptional administrator, [[Conrad L. Wirth]], was available to lead this complex nationwide program. It was a large and dynamic undertaking, at its peak involving administration of 482 CCC camps allotted to state parks employing almost 100,000 enrollees on work projects guided by a technical and professional staff numbering several thousand.\n\nAs this program got under way it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of comprehensive plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, ''A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States'', a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by [[World War II]], Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of [[Mission 66]], and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled ''Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan''. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Parkways===\n[[File:Pinnacles 2.jpg|thumb|500 px|right|View from Pinnacles Overlook on Skyline Drive]]The modern parkway, fruit of the automobile age, appears to have its origins in the Westchester County Parkways, New York, built between 1913 and 1930. At first, Congress also applied the idea locally \u2014 in the District of Columbia \u2014 but later undertook projects more clearly national in scope. Congress authorized its first parkway project in 1913, the four-mile (6&nbsp;km) Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, to connect Potomac Park with [[Rock Creek Park]] and the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]. In 1928, Congress authorized the [[Mount Vernon Memorial Highway]] to link the District of Columbia with [[Mount Vernon]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of Washington's birth. In 1930 this highway was renamed the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and enlarged in concept to extend from Mount Vernon all the way to Great Falls in Virginia, and from Fort Washington to Great Falls in Maryland (Alexandria and the District of Columbia excepted).<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nDuring World War II Congress extended the National Capital parkway network by authorizing the [[Suitland Parkway]] to provide an access road to Andrews Air Force Base, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], whose initial unit provided access to Fort George G. Meade.\n\nThe [[Colonial Parkway]] in Virginia was the first authorized by Congress beyond the District of Columbia vicinity. It provided a landscaped {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway link between Jamestown Island, Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown Battlefield as part of Colonial National Monument, authorized in 1930.\n\nA new era for National Parkways began with authorization of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan parkways serving a variety of local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing hundreds of miles of scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National Parkways started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.\n\n[[File:Blueridgeparkwaylookingglassrock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Blue Ridge Parkway across from Looking Glass Rock]]The [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] served as a prototype for the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]. President Herbert Hoover conceived the idea of the Skyline Drive during vacations at his [[Rapidan Camp]]. It was planned in 1931 and begun as a relief project in 1932.\n\nFollowing President Roosevelt's election Congress quickly enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 to stimulate the economy. Among other provisions it authorized the Public Works Administrator, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], to prepare a comprehensive program of public works. Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia, aided by others, seized the opportunity to propose the construction of a scenic roadway linking [[Shenandoah National Park|Shenandoah]] and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] as a public works project.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nThe [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] is considered by many to be a Service triumph in parkway design, providing the motorist with a serene environment conducive to leisurely travel and enjoyment while affording him many insights into the beauty, history, and culture of the Southern Highlands. The {{convert|469|mi|km|adj=on}} parkway, sometimes called a grand balcony, alternates sweeping views of mountain and valley with intimate glimpses of the fauna and flora of the Blue Ridge and close-up views of typical mountain structures, like Mabry's Mill, built of logs by pioneers and still operating.\n\nThe [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] is the second major National Parkway, a projected {{convert|450|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway through a protected zone of forest, meadow, and field which generally follows the route of the historic Natchez Trace from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The Old Natchez Trace was once an Indian path, then a wilderness road, and finally from 1800 to 1830 a highway binding the old Southwest to the Union. The parkway was completed in 2003 with the final link south of Nashville, Tennessee. The parkway links historic and natural features including Mount Locust, the earliest inn on the Trace, Emerald Mound, one of the largest Indian ceremonial structures in the United States, Chickasaw Village and Bynum Mounds in Mississippi, and Colbert's Ferry and Metal Ford in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Recreational demonstration areas===\n[[File:North valley trail pwfp.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|One of many small cascades on the North Valley Trail in Prince William Forest Park]]Like the Blue Ridge Parkway, two other Recreation Areas in today's National Park System trace their origin back to the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 \u2014 [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], Maryland, and [[Prince William Forest Park]], Virginia.\n\nAmong many other features, the National Industrial Recovery Act authorized federal purchases of land considered submarginal for farming but valuable for recreation purposes. By 1936, 46 projects containing {{convert|397000|acre|km2}} had been set up in 24 different states, mostly near metropolitan centers, to provide outdoor recreation for people from crowded cities. It was intended from the beginning that most of these projects would be turned over to states and cities for operation and in 1942 Congress provided the necessary authority. By 1946 most of the conveyances had been completed. The National Park Service retained Catoctin Mountain Park, site of Camp David, but 4,500 of its acres were transferred to Maryland. Prince William Forest Park (formerly Chopawamsic) was retained as a unit administrated by National Capital Parks.\n\nSome recreational demonstration lands were also added to Acadia, Shenandoah, White Sands, and Hopewell Village. Now largely forgotten, recreational demonstration projects left several permanent marks on the National Park System and illustrated again the ability of the Service to help meet changing social and economic conditions in the nation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Reservoir-related Recreation Areas===\n[[File:Glen Canyon 305947975.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|The Colorado river winds through Glen Canyon in northern Arizona.]]Five National Recreation Areas were added to the System between 1933 and 1964. This new type of federal park area grew out of large scale reclamation projects like Hoover Dam and multi purpose river basin development programs like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] which began in the 1930s and spread to river valleys in all parts of the country after World War II.\n\n[[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]] was the first National Recreation Area. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, passed in 1928, authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Work began in 1931 and the dam, highest in the Western Hemisphere, was completed in 1935. The next year, under provisions of an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for all recreational activities at Lake Mead.\n\nCoulee Dam National Recreation Area (now called [[Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area]]) was established in 1946, under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation patterned after Lake Mead. Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and the dam went into operation in 1941. It impounds a huge body of water named Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, {{convert|151|mi|km}} long with {{convert|660|mi|km}} of shoreline.\n\nAlthough Millerton Lake, California, Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas, and the north unit of Flaming Gorge, Utah-Wyoming were administered by the Service for a time, the first was subsequently turned over to the State of California, the second to the Army Corps of Engineers, and the last to the Forest Service.\n\nThree more National Recreation Areas established during the 1950s are still in the National Park System today. Shadow Mountain, adjoining the west entrance to [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], embraces the recreational features of Lake Granby and Shadow Mountain Lake, two units of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]] was established in 1958 to provide for recreational activities on Lake Powell formed behind Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, one of the highest dams in the world. The [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area]], California, was established by Act of Congress in 1962. The National Park Service, however, administers the recreational facilities only at Whiskeytown Reservoir, while the Forest Service takes care of similar, more extensive facilities at Shasta and Trinity.\n\nBy 1964, application of the National Recreation Area concept to major impoundments behind Federal dams, whether constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps of Engineers, appeared to be well accepted by Congress. Eight more reservations of this type were authorized as additions to the National Park System between 1964 and 1972.\n\n===National Seashores===\n[[File:Point Reyes National Seashore headlands from Chimney Rock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Looking back at the Point Reyes headlands from the Chimney Rock trail in winter. Elephant seals lie in the sand at the bottom of the cliffs. [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]]]The first seashore recreation survey in the mid-1930s resulted in a recommendation that 12 major stretches of unspoiled Atlantic and Gulf Coast shoreline, with {{convert|437|mi|km}} of beach, be preserved. World War II intervened and no action occurred before 1954. Then only one of the proposed areas was created: [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]], North Carolina. All but one \u2014 [[Cape Cod National Seashore|Cape Cod]] \u2014 had become commercial developments. A new shoreline surveys resulted in several major reports including Our ''Vanishing Shoreline'' (1955); ''A Report on the Seashore Recreation Survey of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts'' (1955); ''Our Fourth Shore, Great Lakes Shoreline Recreation Area Survey'' (1959); and ''Pacific Coast Recreation Area Survey'' (1959). By 1972 fruits of this program included eight National Seashores and four National Lakeshores of which the first four were authorized before 1964.\n\nThe National Seashore concept reached the Pacific Coast in 1962 with authorization of [[Point Reyes National Seashore|Point Reyes]], California, embracing more than forty miles of shoreline including historic Drakes Bay, Tomales Point, and Point Reyes itself. The National Seashore concept reached the Gulf Coast in 1962 also with authorization of [[Padre Island National Seashore|Padre Island]], Texas. This great shore island stretches for {{convert|113|mi|km}} along the Texas coast from Corpus Christi on the north almost to Mexico on the south, and varies in width from a few hundred yards to about {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}}. There is some private development at each end of the island.\n\n==The second 50 years; 1966\u20132016==\n\nThe 1960s brought about public awareness of America's natural and historical wealth. The [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] became the start of a 'park's for people' mindset.<ref name=Almanac>National Park Service Almanac, Rocky Mountain Region, National Park Service, Office of Public Affairs, 2007</ref>  Director [[George B. Hartzog Jr.|Hartzog]] was the superintendent of the [[Gateway Arch National Park]], then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, in [[St. Louis]] and was a supporter of public involvement and publicly accessible parks. It was the second 50 years that saw a significant increase in parks accessible to the general populations.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\n===Redwood amendment===\n[[File:Redwood light.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Sequoia sempervirens'' in Redwood National Park}}]]During the 1960s numerous legal challenges arose over the mission of the National Park Service. Using the court decisions, Congress supplemented and clarified the [[National Park Service Organic Act|Organic Act of 1916]] through the [[General Authorities Act of 1970]]. Additional challenges during the 1970s required that Congress again clarify the mission of the National Park Service. The [[Redwood Act (1978)|1979 amendment]] to the General Authorities Act of 1970 has been come known as the \"Redwood amendment\", as it also contained language expanding [[Redwood National Park]]. The key part of that act, as amended, is:\n\n{{quote|Congress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superlative environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system. Congress further reaffirms, declares and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park system, as defined in section Ic of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section I of this title (the Organic Act provisions), to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress.|16 USC Ia-I<ref>Management Policies 2001, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service; December 2000</ref>}}\n\n===National Lakeshores===\n[[File:Pictured Rocks - Grand portal.jpg|thumb|Grand portal at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]]The first national lakeshores were created in 1966 from some of the remaining unspoiled or unique coastlines of the [[Great Lakes]]. The first lakeshores were [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]] in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]] in Northwest Indiana.<ref name=Almanac/> In 1970, two additional lakeshores were added: [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] on Michigan's western shore on [[Lake Michigan]], and [[Apostle Islands National Lakeshore]] on [[Wisconsin|Wisconsin']]s [[Lake Superior]] shore.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\n===National Heritage Area===\nHeritage areas were first established to identify regions having a common cultural impact on the development of the United States. The [[Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail]] in the Virginia, Maryland and District of Columbia was established on March 28, 1983. Fourteen areas exited by November 12, 1996.<ref name=Almanac/>  Initially, all the heritage areas were in the east and northeast. Today, they exist from coast to coast. The entire State of [[Tennessee]] has been designated as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100106023150/http://histpres.mtsu.edu/tncivwar/ Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area]<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/history/heritageareas/ NPS Heritage Areas]</ref>\n\n===Urban recreation areas===\nDuring the [[Richard M. Nixon|Richard Nixon]] presidency, public parks expanded with the creation of the two gateway parks.  [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] in [[San Francisco]] became the western book end to [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] in [[New York City]]. Both were specifically created to serve these two major urban areas and create open space, rather than to preserve a specific scenic or cultural value.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\nOn August 15, 1978, [[President Jimmy Carter]] signed into law the creation of the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]], comprising 15 park units, ranging over 5,000 acres, and included 48 miles of the [[Chattahoochee River]], in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].\n\n===The Alaska expansion===\n[[File:Lake Clark National Park.jpg|thumb|{{center|Lake Clark}}]]In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] created a dozen national monuments, in Alaska.

He wrote, \"by some great protecting policy of government... in a magnificent park... a nation's park, containing man and beast, in all the wild[ness] and freshness of their nature's beauty!\" <ref name=Shaping>The National Parks: Shaping the System; Harpers Ferry Center; U.S. Department of the Interior, Washington, D.C., 2004</ref>\n\nCatlin's vision had no immediate effect. In the east, romantic portrayals of nature by [[James Fenimore Cooper]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] and painters [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederick Edwin Church]] began to compete with prevailing view of wilderness as a challenge to overcome. Slowly unspoiled nature and spectacular natural areas of the West became better known, the idea of saving such places became of interest.\n\nIn California, several state leaders sought to protect [[Yosemite Valley]]. In 1864, Sen. [[John Conness]] of [[California]] sponsored an act to transfer the valley and nearby [[Mariposa Grove|Mariposa Big Tree Grove]] to the state so they might \"be used and preserved for the benefit of mankind\". President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed this act of [[United States Congress|Congress]] on June 30, 1864. California was granted the valley and the grove on condition that They would \"be held for public use, resort, and recreation...inalienable for all time.\"<ref name=\"Shaping \" />\n\nThe [[Yellowstone National Park#Park creation|Yellowstone]] country was first \"officially\" explored by [[Cook\u2013Folsom\u2013Peterson Expedition|David E. Folsom]], [[Washburn-Langford-Doane Expedition|Henry D. Washburn]], and [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871|Ferdinand Hayden]] in 1869-71. A myth evolved that near the end of the Washburn expedition, discussion around the campfire led several of the members to suggest that the area be set aside for public use and not allow it to be sold to private individuals. This myth was successfully exploited by National Park advocates but eventually was debunked by historians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schullery |first=Paul |title=Myth and History in the Creation of Yellowstone National Park |author2=Whittlesey, Lee |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=2003 |isbn=0-8032-4305-7 |pages=30\u201332 }}</ref> An early ally in promoting a public reservation was the [[Northern Pacific Railroad Company]]. They were seeking major destinations for their route through Montana.<ref name=\"Shaping \" /> In an effort to reduce poaching and other misuse of the park, the U.S. Army established a fort in the area in 1881 and began park protection, establishing a pattern that would be continued by later park rangers.\n\nIn 1875, [[Mackinac National Park]] was created on a resort island in Lake Huron in Michigan, the second national park. As at Yellowstone, the army garrison at [[Fort Mackinac]] were in charge of supervising and improving the park. The fort and the national park were turned over to state control in 1895.\n\nU.S. cavalry units took up a position in California-controlled Yosemite Park in 1891 and took over some management duties. In 1906 the park was completely taken into federal control.\n\n===National Monument line I, 1906\u20131916===\nWhile early emphasis had been on the creation of [[National Parks]], there was another movement seeking to preserve the cliff dwellings, pueblo ruins, and early missions throughout the west and southwest. Often local ranchers would try to protect these ruins from plunder, but pot-hunters vandalized many sites. The effort began in Boston and spread to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Denver]], and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], during the 1880s and 1890s. Rep. [[John Fletcher Lacey]] of [[Iowa]] and Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] of [[Massachusetts]], created the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />[[File:Devils Tower from west.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Devils Tower's westwall is a {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} vertical climb]]\n\nThe [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] was designed to protect antiquities and objects of scientific interest on the public domain. It authorized the [[President of the United States|President]], \"to declare by public proclamation historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest\" that existed on public lands in the United States. The Act declared these sites to be National Monuments. It prohibited the excavation or removal of objects on Federal land unless a permit had been issued by the appropriate department.<ref name=\"Lee\" /> Between 1906 and 1933 three Federal agencies, the Departments of [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Defense|War]], initiated and administered separate groups of [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]]s.\n\nPresident [[Theodore Roosevelt]] signed the Antiquities Act on June 8, 1906. As early as 1889 Congress authorized the President to reserve the land on which the well known [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruin]] was located. In 1904, Dr. [[Edgar Lee Hewett]] made a review of all the Indian ruins on Federal lands in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], and [[Utah]]. He recommended many sites for protection. Based on Hewett's report and many individual request and reports from throughout the west, between 1906 and 1916 the Interior Department recommended and Presidents Roosevelt, [[William Howard Taft]], and [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed twenty National Monuments.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nOn September 24, 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]] as the first National Monument. Devils Tower is a Wyoming landmark, a {{convert|600|ft|m|adj=on}} high tower of rock, visible for nearly {{convert|100|mi|km}}. It has been a guidepost and a religious site. In December of that year, three more National Monuments were created. [[El Morro National Monument|El Morro]], New Mexico, is a wayside in the rugged desert lands used by Indians settlers and travelers for centuries as a watering hole and a place to leave their marks. The site includes prehistoric [[petroglyphs]] and hundreds of inscriptions from 17th century Spanish explorers and 19th century American emigrants and settlers. [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Arizona]], is one of the best preserved cliff dwellings. [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], Arizona, is world-renowned for its petrified wood, Indian ruins and petroglyphs. Three of these original National Monuments later became the core of National Parks. Mukuntuweap became [[Zion National Park|Zion]], Sieur de Monts grew into [[Acadia National Park|Acadia]], and Petrified Forest which was expanded by Congress to become a National Park of the same name. Three of the smaller areas were later abolished, those being [[Lewis and Clark Caverns]], Shoshone Cavern, and [[Papago Park|Papago Saguaro]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Mineral Springs line, 1832\u20131916===\n[[File:Quapaw Baths HABS 1984.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Quapaw Baths from HABS image]]Mineral springs have been used for their medicinal properties since ancient times. By 1800, places like [[Saratoga Springs]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Berkeley Springs]] and [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia|White Sulphur Springs]], [[West Virginia]], and [[French Lick]], [[Indiana]], were becoming popular American resorts. In 1832 [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]], was set aside as a Federal reservation to protect 47 hot springs. In 1870 the area was protected by Congress as the [[Hot Springs Reservation]] and in 1921 it was made a National Park. [[Hot Springs National Park]] is a health resort and spa rather than a scenic area.\n\nIn 1902 the Federal Government purchased 32 mineral springs near [[Sulphur, Oklahoma]], from the [[Choctaw]] and [[Chickasaw]] Indians. The Sulphur Springs Reservation was placed under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior who shortly acquired some additional land. In 1906 Congress created [[Platt National Park]] which included the Sulphur Springs Reservation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n==Establishment, 1916==\nForty-four years after the establishment of [[Yellowstone]], President [[Woodrow Wilson]] created the [[National Park Service]] on August 25, 1916. For years [[J. Horace McFarland]], President of the [[American Civic Association]]; Secretaries of the Interior [[Walter L. Fisher|Walter Fisher]] and [[Franklin K. Lane]]; Presidents [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]]; [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]].; Representatives [[William Kent (U.S. Congressman)|William Kent]] and [[John E. Raker]] of California; Senator [[Reed Smoot]] of Utah; [[Stephen T. Mather]] and [[Horace M. Albright]] had been seeking the creation of separate agency to manage the National Parks and Monuments.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n==Reorganization of 1933==\nOn June 11, 1933, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] signed Executive Order 6166 which consolidated all National Parks and National Monuments, National Military Parks, the eleven National Cemeteries, National Memorials, and the National Capital Parks into a single National Park System. The National Park Service was directed to oversee all of these areas.<ref>Horace M. Albright, Origins of National Park Service Administration of Historic Sites, [[Eastern National Park and Monument Association]], 1971</ref>\nThere were three significant results of this action:\n# it made the National Park Service the sole Federal agency responsible for all Federally owned public parks, monuments, and memorials;\n# it enlarged the National Park System idea to include at least four types of areas not clearly included in the System concept before 1933 \u2014 [[National Memorials]], like the [[Washington Monument]] and the [[Statue of Liberty]]; [[National Military Park]]s, like [[Gettysburg National Military Park|Gettysburg]] and [[Antietam National Battlefield|Antietam]] with their adjoining [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]]; [[National Capital Parks]], a great urban park system as old as the nation itself; and the first recreational area \u2014 [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]];\n# the reorganization substantially increased the number of areas in the System by adding 12 natural areas in 9 western states and [[Alaska]] and 57 historical areas located in 17 predominantly eastern states and the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Capital Parks line, 1790\u20131933===\n[[File:The Mall in WDC.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The Mall]]National Capital Parks are the oldest parks in the National Park System. These parks began with the founding of the [[District of Columbia]] in 1790. The President appointed three Federal Commissioners to design a district {{convert|10|mi|km|spell=in}} square on the Potomac River for the permanent seat of the Federal Government. The current National Capital Parks office is a direct lineal descendant of the original office established by the first commissioners of the District of Columbia in 1791.<ref>Cornelius W. Heine, A History of National Capital Parks (Washington: National Park Service, 1953)</ref>\n\nPresident [[George Washington]] engaged Major [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]] to design the new capital city. The [[Washington D.C.#Cityscape|L'Enfant Plan]] proposed a city of beauty. The plan was designed around a series of boulevards, parks and [[National Mall|The Mall]]. Additionally, L'Enfant envisaged a Congress Garden and a President's Park; embellished with statues, columns, or obelisks; grand fountains; an equestrian statue of Washington; a Naval Column; and a zero milestone.\n\n[[Rock Creek Park]] was authorized on September 27, 1890, two days after [[Sequoia National Park|Sequoia]] and three days before [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]]. Congress carried over some of the language of the [[Yellowstone Act]] into all three acts. Like Yellowstone, [[Rock Creek Park]] was \"dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasure ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of the United States,\" where all timber, animals, and curiosities were to be retained \"in their natural condition, as nearly as possible.\" Though not a 'National Park', Rock Creek Park is a major urban park of the nation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Memorials line, 1776\u20131933===\n[[File:WashingtonMonumentTidalBasin.JPG|thumb|300 px|left|Washington Monument]]The first memorial was authorized by the [[Continental Congress]] on January 25, 1776, to honor General [[Richard Montgomery]], killed during an assault on the heights of [[Quebec]] in the midst of a snowstorm on the night of December 31, 1775. Montgomery commanded New York troops sent a few months before on an expedition designed to win Canada to the Revolutionary cause. It failed before Quebec, and Montgomery, became one of the first Revolutionary generals to lose his life on the field of battle. The Montgomery Memorial is not a part of the National Park System. But the chapel where it is located, St. Paul's Chapel, is a [[National Historic Landmark]].\n\nThe Continental Congress climaxed its commemorative actions in August 1783 by resolving \"that an equestrian statue of General Washington be erected where the residence of Congress shall be established.\" The equestrian statue of Washington is executed by Clark Mills, placed in [[Washington Circle]] on [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenue]], and dedicated in 1859.\n\nWhen the centennial of Washington's birth came in 1832 with no satisfactory monument to in the National Capital, [[George Watterston]], [[Librarian of Congress]], and other civic leaders organized the [[Washington Monument]] Society, to erect an appropriate monument from private subscriptions. In 1848 Congress transferred a site on the Mall to the Society, and the cornerstone of the Washington Monument was laid on July 4. Slow progress was made worse by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. When the nation's first centennial came around in 1876 the Washington Monument was only a third completed. The [[United States Congress]] passed legislation authorizing the transfer of the Monument and site to the United States for completion and maintenance as a National Memorial. The Washington Monument was dedicated on February 21, 1885.\n\nIn 1933 these National Memorials were added to the [[National Park System]] and the National Memorial function assigned to the National Park Service, except [[Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial|Perry's Victory Memorial]], which was administered by a commission until it was added to the System in 1936. Also, the fiscal functions of the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Commission were assigned to the [[National Park Service]] in 1933 and the Memorial itself in 1938.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Military Parks line, 1781\u20131933===\n[[File:Cowpens225-2.JPG|thumb|left|300 px|Battle of Cowpens Reenactment, 225th anniversary, January 14, 2006]]The National Military Park line, including early battlefield monuments, began in 1781. Between 1890 and 1933 the War Department developed it into a National Military Park System. In 1933, there were twenty areas, 11 National Military Parks and 9 National Battlefield Sites.\nThe line started on October 29, 1781, when the [[Continental Congress]] authorized the first official on-site battlefield monument. It resolved: \"That the United States in Congress assembled, will cause to be erected at York, in Virginia, a marble column, adorned with emblems of the alliance between the United States and His Most Christian Majesty; and inscribed with a succinct narrative of the surrender....\"\nIn 1823 in [[Boston]]; [[Daniel Webster]], [[Edward Everett]], and other prominent citizens formed the Bunker Hill Battle Monument Association to save part of the historic field and erect on it a great commemorative monument. The cornerstone was laid on June 17, 1825. During the Revolutionary Centennial years, 1876\u201383, Congress appropriated federal funds to match local funds for Revolutionary battle monuments, and through this means imposing monuments were erected at [[Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site|Bennington Battlefield]], Vermont; [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]], [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]], and [[Battle of Oriskany|Oriskany]], New York; [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]], South Carolina; [[Battle of Monmouth|Monmouth]], New Jersey; and [[Battle of Groton Heights|Groton]], Connecticut. Of these, Cowpens is now a unit in the National Park System, and Bunker Hill, Bennington, Oriskany, and Monmouth are [[National Historic Landmarks]].\nApril 30, 1864, in the midst of the Civil War, [[Pennsylvania]] chartered the [[Gettysburg Battlefield]] Memorial Association to commemorate \"the great deeds of valor... and the signal events which render these battlegrounds illustrious.\" This association was among the earliest historic preservation organizations in the country. By 1890 it had acquired several hundred acres of land on the battlefield including areas in the vicinity of Spangler's Spring, the Wheatfield, Little Round Top, and the Peach Orchard as well as the small white frame house General Meade had used as headquarters.\n\nWith interest and support from both North and South Congress decided to go beyond the former battlefield monument concept to authorize the first four National Military Parks \u2014 [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park|Chickamauga & Chattanooga]] in 1890, [[Shiloh National Military Park|Shiloh]] in 1894, [[Gettysburg Battlefield|Gettysburg]] in 1895, and [[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg]] in 1899. These areas were not selected at random but constituted, almost from the beginning, a rational system, designed to preserve major battlefields for historical and professional study and as lasting memorials to the great armies of both sides.\n\nThe National Military Park System was approaching maturity under the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] in 1933 when all these battlefields were transferred to the National Park Service to become a significant and unique element in the National Park System.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\nAll of the exhibits are permanent, and will always be shown in the museum.\n\n===National Cemetery line, 1867\u20131933===\n[[File:Gettysburg national cemetery img 4164.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Gettysburg National Cemetery]]The [[United States National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]] in the National Park System are closely related to the National Military Parks. The [[battle of Gettysburg]] was scarcely over when Governor Andrew Y. Curtin ([[Pennsylvania]]) hastened to the field to assist local residents in caring for the dead or dying. More than 6,000 soldiers had been killed in action, and among 21,000 wounded hundreds more died each day. Initially interred in improvised graves on the battlefield, Curtin approved plans for a Soldier's National Cemetery.\n\n[[William Saunders (botanist)|William Saunders]] planned [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]]. He enclosed it with a massive stone wall, the lawns were framed by trees and shrubs. The graves were laid out in a great semicircle, state by state, around the site for a sculptured central feature, a Soldier's National Monument. The Soldier's National Cemetery, as it was then called, was dedicated by President [[Abraham Lincoln]] on November 19, 1863. The speaker's platform occupied the site set aside for the Soldier's National Monument, then awaiting future design. The immortal words of Lincoln's [[Gettysburg Address]] gave this spot a historical and patriotic association. [[Gettysburg National Cemetery]] became the honored property of the nation on May 1, 1872, now a century ago.\n\nCongress recognized the importance of honoring and caring for the remains of the war dead by enacting general legislation in 1867 which provided for a system of National Cemeteries developed by the War Department. Eleven of the National Cemeteries established under that authority were added to the National Park System in 1933. The act of 1867 also provided authority for preserving an important battlefield of the Indian wars when, on January 29, 1879, the Secretary of War designated \"The National Cemetery of Custer's Battlefield Reservation.\"<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Monument line II, 1910\u20131933; War Department===\nThe [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] authorized the President to proclaim National Monuments not only on western public lands but on any lands owned or controlled by the United States.

In 1916 these two monuments formed the nucleus for [[Lassen Volcanic National Park]].\n\nFourteen of the other Department of Agriculture National Monuments were established to preserve \"scientific objects\". Moved by a report of plans to build an electric railway along its rim, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed [[Grand Canyon National Monument]] on lands within the [[Grand Canyon National Forest]], [[Arizona]], on January 11, 1908. In 1919 the National Monument became the nucleus of [[Grand Canyon National Park]].\n\n[[File:2000-09-23 GracieByDownedCyprus.jpg|thumb|right|300 px|Downed Western Red Cedar]]Two days before leaving office, on March 2, 1909, Roosevelt proclaimed Mount Olympus National Monument, from lands in the [[Olympic National Forest]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

Among many other measures in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted a broad program of natural resource conservation implemented in large part through the newly created [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. At the program's peak in 1935, the Service had 600 CCC camps, 118 of them assigned to National Park System areas and 482 to State Parks, employing approximately 120,000 enrollees and 6,000 professionally trained supervisors.\n\nBy mid-century, a great and growing backlog of deferred park maintenance and development projects, posed vast new problems for the Service and System. It was an era marked by the dramatic inauguration and prosecution of [[Mission 66]], the emergence of a national \"crisis in outdoor recreation,\" creation of the [[Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission]] and the [[Bureau of Outdoor Recreation]], and mounting national concern for better preservation of America's vanishing wilderness.\n\nBetween the Reorganization of 1933 and the Reorganization of 1964, 102 areas were added to the System as defined today, increasing the total number from 137 to 239 The distribution of the new areas among categories is significant. Of the new additions, 11 were \"Natural Areas\", increasing their number from 58 to 69 or 19%. Seventy-five were \"Historical Areas\", increasing their number from 77 to 152 or 96%. Fifteen were \"Recreation Areas\", increasing their number from one to 16, or 1500%. It is clear that during this period the growth rate for Natural Areas noticeably diminished from previous levels and by comparison with the rate for other categories, even though very important additions of natural lands were still being made. On the other hand, the growth rates for Historical and Recreation Areas accelerated sharply. It took the Service a generation, from 1933 to 1964, to assimilate these 102 diverse new areas and the 71 areas added by the Reorganization of 1933 and incorporate them securely into one National Park System.\n\n===Natural areas, 1933\u20131966===\n[[File:Olympic National Park coast.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Olympic National Park (Pacific Coast section)]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

In 1926 he visited the area and discovered the cheap commercial development, on private lands, in the midst of superlative natural beauty. There were dance halls, hot dog stands, filling stations, rodeo grand stands, and billboards, blocking the view of the Teton Range.\n\n[[File:Barns grand tetons.jpg|thumb|400 px|right|Grand Teton National Park]]Rockefeller began a land acquisition program. In a few years he held over {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} in [[Jackson Hole, Wyoming|Jackson Hole]]. He offered these lands as a gift to the United States. Meanwhile, opposition developed among cattlemen, dude ranchers, packers, hunters, timber interests, and local Forest Service officials. By 1943, there was still no park legislation. Rockefeller indicated he might dispose of the property if no action was pending. On March 15, 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt proclaimed the Jackson Hole National Monument, consolidating {{convert|33000|acre|km2}} donated by Rockefeller with {{convert|179000|acre|km2}} withdrawn from [[Teton National Forest]]. Thus, [[Grand Teton National Park]] was created.\n\nPresident Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism which had been brewing for years among western members of Congress. Rep. [[Frank A. Barrett]] of [[Wyoming]] and others introduced bills to abolish the monument and to repeal Section 2 of the [[Antiquities Act]] containing the President's authority to proclaim National Monuments. A bill to abolish the monument passed Congress in 1944 but was vetoed by President Roosevelt. The President noted in his veto that Presidents of both political parties, beginning with Theodore Roosevelt, had established ample precedents by proclaiming 82 National Monuments, seven of which were larger than Jackson Hole. The proclamation was nevertheless also contested in court, where it was strongly defended by the Departments of [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]] and upheld. A compromise was worked out and embodied in legislation approved by President [[Harry S Truman]] on September 14, 1950. It combined [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] and the old Grand Teton National Park in a \"new Grand Teton National Park\" containing some {{convert|298000|acre|km2}}, with special provisions regarding taxes and hunting. It also prohibited establishing or enlarging National Parks or Monuments in Wyoming in the future except by express authorization of Congress.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Historical areas, 1933\u20131966===\n[[File:Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts, July 2005.JPG|thumb|right|Old North Bridge, [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in [[Massachusetts]]]]\nSeventy-five Historical Areas were added to the National Park System between 1933 and 1964, including nine National Historic Sites and one International Park in non-federal ownership. Areas represented nine historic themes: I. ''The Original Inhabitants'' (6); II. ''European Exploration & Settlement'' (12): III. ''Development of the English Colonies'', 1700-1775 (2); IV. ''Major American Wars'' (10): V. ''Political and Military Affairs'' (16); VI. ''Westward Expansion'' 1763-1898 (15); VII ''America At Work'' (9): VIII ''The Contemplative Society'' (0); IX ''Society and Social Conscience'' (5).\n\nMuch of this would not have happened without the [[Historic Sites Act]] of 1935, a logical follow-up to the ''Reorganization of 1933''. On November 10, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited his friend and neighbor, Major Gist Blair, to give consideration \"to some kind of plan which would coordinate the broad relationship of the Federal Government to State and local interest in the maintenance of historic sources and places throughout the country.\n\nThe Act declared \"that it is a national policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States'.\" This new and greatly broadened national policy has been the cornerstone of the Federal Government's historic preservation program ever since 1935, reaffirmed both in the Act of October 26, 1949, which created the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], and in the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]]. To carry out the policy, the Act assigned broad powers, duties and functions to the Secretary of the Interior to be exercised through the National Park Service, among them:\n# make a national survey of historic and archaeological sites, buildings, and objects to determine which have \"exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States;\"\n# acquire real or personal property for the purpose of the Act;\n# contract or make cooperative agreements with states, municipal subdivisions, corporations, associations, or individuals to preserve historic properties.\nThe Act established an Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments.\n\n[[File:The Old Courthouse, Saint Louis, Missouri.JPG|thumb|right|The Old Courthouse, part of the [[Gateway Arch National Park]] in [[Missouri]]]]\nSome of the most important historical additions to the system between 1933 and 1964 are almost lost to sight in this long thematic list. [[Gateway Arch National Park]], at first known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, was the first National Historic Site established under authority of the Historic Sites Act. More importantly, its 37 square blocks embraced a key urban area on the historic St. Louis waterfront \u2014 the first major effort of the NPS, after [[National Capital Parks]], to conserve and develop a large and important urban historic site. Some architectural monuments, including the Old St. Louis Post Office and the Cathedral, have been carefully preserved, but the main feature of the area is the only major national memorial of modern design in the United States, and one of a small number in the world \u2014 [[Eero Saarinen]]'s stainless steel Arch.\n\nIn 1948 Congress authorized another major urban project, the [[Independence National Historical Park]] in [[Philadelphia]], the most important historical area in the United States, embracing Independence Hall and Square, Congress Hall, Carpenters Hall, and many other sites and buildings associated with independence and the establishment of a government under the Constitution. The method of analyzing complex urban problems was used in Boston, where it led to authorization of [[Minute Man National Historical Park]] in 1959 and other sites, including the [[Bunker Hill Monument]], [[Faneuil Hall]], and the [[Old State House (Boston)|Old Boston State House]]. A commission was established for [[New York City]], where a complex of urban monuments were added, including [[Federal Hall National Memorial]], [[Castle Clinton]], [[Grant Memorial]], [[Hamilton Grange]], [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|Theodore Roosevelt's Birthplace]], and [[Sagamore Hill]], to the previously authorized [[Statue of Liberty National Monument]], whose boundaries were extended to include [[Ellis Island]].\n\nThe [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] was organized in 1933 upon the initiative of [[Charles E. Peterson]] of the [[National Park Service]] in cooperation with officials of the Library of Congress and the American Institute of Architects. Since 1933 the HABS has gathered more than 30,000 measured drawings, 40,000 photographs, and 13,000 pages of documentation for more than 13,000 of the Nation's historic buildings.\n\n[[File:Ellis Island Hall Interior.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ellis Island]]'s main hall]].\nThe National Survey of Historic Sites and Buildings was organized after passage of the Historic Sites Act in 1935. Beginning in 1960, the responsibilities of this Survey staff were extended to include recommendation of an important series of National Historic Landmarks, officially designated by the Secretary of the Interior. On October 9, 1960 Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton announced the first official list of 92 historic sites and buildings eligible for designation as [[National Historic Landmarks]]. {{see also| National Register of Historic Places}}\n\nThe Inter-Agency Archaeological Salvage Program was organized by the National Park Service in 1946 at the request of the Committee for Recovery of Archaeological Remains to coordinate the salvage of irreplaceable pre-historic and historic Indian artifacts from projected reservoir sites in river valleys throughout the United States, before flooding. This program, which has been conducted for a quarter of a century in cooperation with the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and universities, museums, and research institutions throughout the country, has enormously deepened knowledge of American prehistory.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Recreation areas, 1933\u20131966===\nThe Service responded to the emerging social and economic forces of the New Deal era, by expanding its cooperative relationships with the States, securing enactment of the comprehensive Park, Parkway and Recreation Area Study Act of 1936, and initiating four new types of Federal park areas \u2014 [[National Parkway]]s, [[National Recreation Area]]s, [[National Seashore]]s and [[Recreational Demonstration Area]]s. By the end of this period, fifteen of the over 50 such areas remained under the administration of the National Park Service. Because they had much in common, they were collectively designated Recreation Areas in the Reorganization of 1964.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''National Parkways'''\n* 1933 [[Blue Ridge Parkway|Blue Ridge]], VA-NC\n* 1934 [[Natchez Trace]], MS-AL-TN\n* 1949 [[Suitland Parkway|Suitland]], DC-MD\n\n'''National Seashores'''\n* 1937 [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore|Cape Hatteras]], NC\n* 1961 [[Cape Cod National Seashore|Cape Cod]], MA\n* 1962 [[Point Reyes National Seashore|Point Reyes]], CA\n* 1962 [[Padre Island National Seashore|Padre Island]], TX\n* 1965 [[Assateague Island National Seashore|Assateague Island]], MD-VA\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Recreational Demonstration Areas'''\n* 1936 [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], MD\n* 1936 [[Prince William Forest Park]], VA\n\n'''Reservoir-related Recreation Areas'''\n* 1936 [[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]], AZ-NV\n* 1946 [[Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area|Coulee Dam]], WA\n* 1952 Shadow Mountain, CO\n* 1958 [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]], AZ-UT\n* 1962 [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area|Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity]], CA\n{{col-end}}\n\n[[File:Grand Coulee Dam panorama.jpg|thumb|900 px|right|Grand Coulee Dam, Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area]]\n\nThe origin of Recreation Areas as a category in the National Park System stemmed in important part from widened responsibilities assigned to the Service beginning in the 1930s. A central feature of these new responsibilities was administration of hundreds of [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps located in State Parks. The [[National Park Service]] had actively encouraged the state park movement ever since [[Stephen Tyng Mather]] helped organize the National Conference on State Parks at Des Moines, Iowa, in 1921. It was natural for the Service to be asked to assume national direction of [[s:Executive Order 7034|Emergency Conservation Work]] in state parks when that program was launched in 1933. Fortunately for the Service an exceptional administrator, [[Conrad L. Wirth]], was available to lead this complex nationwide program. It was a large and dynamic undertaking, at its peak involving administration of 482 CCC camps allotted to state parks employing almost 100,000 enrollees on work projects guided by a technical and professional staff numbering several thousand.\n\nAs this program got under way it became painfully evident that in the 1930s most states lacked any kind of comprehensive plans for state park systems. In 1941 the Service published its first comprehensive report, ''A Study of the Park and Recreation Problem in the United States'', a careful review of the whole problem of recreation and of national, state, county, and municipal parks in the United States. Interrupted by [[World War II]], Director Wirth arranged for these studies to be resumed with the inception of [[Mission 66]], and a second comprehensive report was published in 1964 entitled ''Parks for America, A Survey of Park and Related Resources in the Fifty States and a Preliminary Plan''. Numerous land planning studies of individual areas, river basins, and regions accompanied and supported these comprehensive reports. The four new types of Federal Recreation Areas added to the System between 1933 and 1964 were generally consistent with recommendations in these studies.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===National Parkways===\n[[File:Pinnacles 2.jpg|thumb|500 px|right|View from Pinnacles Overlook on Skyline Drive]]The modern parkway, fruit of the automobile age, appears to have its origins in the Westchester County Parkways, New York, built between 1913 and 1930. At first, Congress also applied the idea locally \u2014 in the District of Columbia \u2014 but later undertook projects more clearly national in scope. Congress authorized its first parkway project in 1913, the four-mile (6&nbsp;km) Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway, to connect Potomac Park with [[Rock Creek Park]] and the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoological Park]]. In 1928, Congress authorized the [[Mount Vernon Memorial Highway]] to link the District of Columbia with [[Mount Vernon]] in commemoration of the bicentennial of Washington's birth. In 1930 this highway was renamed the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], and enlarged in concept to extend from Mount Vernon all the way to Great Falls in Virginia, and from Fort Washington to Great Falls in Maryland (Alexandria and the District of Columbia excepted).<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nDuring World War II Congress extended the National Capital parkway network by authorizing the [[Suitland Parkway]] to provide an access road to Andrews Air Force Base, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], whose initial unit provided access to Fort George G. Meade.\n\nThe [[Colonial Parkway]] in Virginia was the first authorized by Congress beyond the District of Columbia vicinity. It provided a landscaped {{convert|23|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway link between Jamestown Island, Colonial Williamsburg, and Yorktown Battlefield as part of Colonial National Monument, authorized in 1930.\n\nA new era for National Parkways began with authorization of the Blue Ridge and Natchez Trace Parkways during the 1930s. These were not fairly short county or metropolitan parkways serving a variety of local and national traffic but protected recreational roadways traversing hundreds of miles of scenic and historic rural landscape. These different National Parkways started out as public works projects during the New Deal and were transformed into units of the National Park System.\n\n[[File:Blueridgeparkwaylookingglassrock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Blue Ridge Parkway across from Looking Glass Rock]]The [[Skyline Drive]] in [[Shenandoah National Park]] served as a prototype for the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]]. President Herbert Hoover conceived the idea of the Skyline Drive during vacations at his [[Rapidan Camp]]. It was planned in 1931 and begun as a relief project in 1932.\n\nFollowing President Roosevelt's election Congress quickly enacted the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 to stimulate the economy. Among other provisions it authorized the Public Works Administrator, Secretary of the Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]], to prepare a comprehensive program of public works. Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] of Virginia, aided by others, seized the opportunity to propose the construction of a scenic roadway linking [[Shenandoah National Park|Shenandoah]] and [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] as a public works project.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\nThe [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] is considered by many to be a Service triumph in parkway design, providing the motorist with a serene environment conducive to leisurely travel and enjoyment while affording him many insights into the beauty, history, and culture of the Southern Highlands. The {{convert|469|mi|km|adj=on}} parkway, sometimes called a grand balcony, alternates sweeping views of mountain and valley with intimate glimpses of the fauna and flora of the Blue Ridge and close-up views of typical mountain structures, like Mabry's Mill, built of logs by pioneers and still operating.\n\nThe [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] is the second major National Parkway, a projected {{convert|450|mi|km|adj=on}} roadway through a protected zone of forest, meadow, and field which generally follows the route of the historic Natchez Trace from Nashville, Tennessee, to Natchez, Mississippi. The Old Natchez Trace was once an Indian path, then a wilderness road, and finally from 1800 to 1830 a highway binding the old Southwest to the Union. The parkway was completed in 2003 with the final link south of Nashville, Tennessee. The parkway links historic and natural features including Mount Locust, the earliest inn on the Trace, Emerald Mound, one of the largest Indian ceremonial structures in the United States, Chickasaw Village and Bynum Mounds in Mississippi, and Colbert's Ferry and Metal Ford in Tennessee.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Recreational demonstration areas===\n[[File:North valley trail pwfp.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|One of many small cascades on the North Valley Trail in Prince William Forest Park]]Like the Blue Ridge Parkway, two other Recreation Areas in today's National Park System trace their origin back to the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] of 1933 \u2014 [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], Maryland, and [[Prince William Forest Park]], Virginia.\n\nAmong many other features, the National Industrial Recovery Act authorized federal purchases of land considered submarginal for farming but valuable for recreation purposes. By 1936, 46 projects containing {{convert|397000|acre|km2}} had been set up in 24 different states, mostly near metropolitan centers, to provide outdoor recreation for people from crowded cities. It was intended from the beginning that most of these projects would be turned over to states and cities for operation and in 1942 Congress provided the necessary authority. By 1946 most of the conveyances had been completed. The National Park Service retained Catoctin Mountain Park, site of Camp David, but 4,500 of its acres were transferred to Maryland. Prince William Forest Park (formerly Chopawamsic) was retained as a unit administrated by National Capital Parks.\n\nSome recreational demonstration lands were also added to Acadia, Shenandoah, White Sands, and Hopewell Village. Now largely forgotten, recreational demonstration projects left several permanent marks on the National Park System and illustrated again the ability of the Service to help meet changing social and economic conditions in the nation.<ref name=\"Lee\" />\n\n===Reservoir-related Recreation Areas===\n[[File:Glen Canyon 305947975.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|The Colorado river winds through Glen Canyon in northern Arizona.]]Five National Recreation Areas were added to the System between 1933 and 1964. This new type of federal park area grew out of large scale reclamation projects like Hoover Dam and multi purpose river basin development programs like the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] which began in the 1930s and spread to river valleys in all parts of the country after World War II.\n\n[[Lake Mead National Recreation Area|Lake Mead]] was the first National Recreation Area. The Boulder Canyon Project Act, passed in 1928, authorized the Bureau of Reclamation to construct Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. Work began in 1931 and the dam, highest in the Western Hemisphere, was completed in 1935. The next year, under provisions of an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service assumed responsibility for all recreational activities at Lake Mead.\n\nCoulee Dam National Recreation Area (now called [[Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area]]) was established in 1946, under an agreement with the Bureau of Reclamation patterned after Lake Mead. Construction of Grand Coulee Dam began in 1933 and the dam went into operation in 1941. It impounds a huge body of water named Franklin D. Roosevelt Lake, {{convert|151|mi|km}} long with {{convert|660|mi|km}} of shoreline.\n\nAlthough Millerton Lake, California, Lake Texoma, Oklahoma-Texas, and the north unit of Flaming Gorge, Utah-Wyoming were administered by the Service for a time, the first was subsequently turned over to the State of California, the second to the Army Corps of Engineers, and the last to the Forest Service.\n\nThree more National Recreation Areas established during the 1950s are still in the National Park System today. Shadow Mountain, adjoining the west entrance to [[Rocky Mountain National Park]], embraces the recreational features of Lake Granby and Shadow Mountain Lake, two units of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]] was established in 1958 to provide for recreational activities on Lake Powell formed behind Glen Canyon Dam on the Colorado River, one of the highest dams in the world. The [[Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area]], California, was established by Act of Congress in 1962. The National Park Service, however, administers the recreational facilities only at Whiskeytown Reservoir, while the Forest Service takes care of similar, more extensive facilities at Shasta and Trinity.\n\nBy 1964, application of the National Recreation Area concept to major impoundments behind Federal dams, whether constructed by the Bureau of Reclamation or the Corps of Engineers, appeared to be well accepted by Congress. Eight more reservations of this type were authorized as additions to the National Park System between 1964 and 1972.\n\n===National Seashores===\n[[File:Point Reyes National Seashore headlands from Chimney Rock.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Looking back at the Point Reyes headlands from the Chimney Rock trail in winter. Elephant seals lie in the sand at the bottom of the cliffs. [[Point Reyes National Seashore]]]]The first seashore recreation survey in the mid-1930s resulted in a recommendation that 12 major stretches of unspoiled Atlantic and Gulf Coast shoreline, with {{convert|437|mi|km}} of beach, be preserved. World War II intervened and no action occurred before 1954. Then only one of the proposed areas was created: [[Cape Hatteras National Seashore]], North Carolina. All but one \u2014 [[Cape Cod National Seashore|Cape Cod]] \u2014 had become commercial developments. A new shoreline surveys resulted in several major reports including Our ''Vanishing Shoreline'' (1955); ''A Report on the Seashore Recreation Survey of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts'' (1955); ''Our Fourth Shore, Great Lakes Shoreline Recreation Area Survey'' (1959); and ''Pacific Coast Recreation Area Survey'' (1959). By 1972 fruits of this program included eight National Seashores and four National Lakeshores of which the first four were authorized before 1964.\n\nThe National Seashore concept reached the Pacific Coast in 1962 with authorization of [[Point Reyes National Seashore|Point Reyes]], California, embracing more than forty miles of shoreline including historic Drakes Bay, Tomales Point, and Point Reyes itself. The National Seashore concept reached the Gulf Coast in 1962 also with authorization of [[Padre Island National Seashore|Padre Island]], Texas. This great shore island stretches for {{convert|113|mi|km}} along the Texas coast from Corpus Christi on the north almost to Mexico on the south, and varies in width from a few hundred yards to about {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in}}. There is some private development at each end of the island.\n\n==The second 50 years; 1966\u20132016==\n\nThe 1960s brought about public awareness of America's natural and historical wealth. The [[Lyndon B. Johnson Administration|Johnson Administration]] became the start of a 'park's for people' mindset.<ref name=Almanac>National Park Service Almanac, Rocky Mountain Region, National Park Service, Office of Public Affairs, 2007</ref>  Director [[George B. Hartzog Jr.|Hartzog]] was the superintendent of the [[Gateway Arch National Park]], then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, in [[St. Louis]] and was a supporter of public involvement and publicly accessible parks. It was the second 50 years that saw a significant increase in parks accessible to the general populations.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\n===Redwood amendment===\n[[File:Redwood light.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Sequoia sempervirens'' in Redwood National Park}}]]During the 1960s numerous legal challenges arose over the mission of the National Park Service. Using the court decisions, Congress supplemented and clarified the [[National Park Service Organic Act|Organic Act of 1916]] through the [[General Authorities Act of 1970]]. Additional challenges during the 1970s required that Congress again clarify the mission of the National Park Service. The [[Redwood Act (1978)|1979 amendment]] to the General Authorities Act of 1970 has been come known as the \"Redwood amendment\", as it also contained language expanding [[Redwood National Park]]. The key part of that act, as amended, is:\n\n{{quote|Congress declares that the national park system, which began with establishment of Yellowstone National Park in 1872, has since grown to include superlative natural, historic, and recreation areas in every major region of the United States, its territories and island possessions; that these areas, though distinct in character, are united through their inter-related purposes and resources into one national park system as cumulative expressions of a single national heritage; that, individually and collectively, these areas derive increased national dignity and recognition of their superlative environmental quality through their inclusion jointly with each other in one national park system preserved and managed for the benefit and inspiration of all the people of the United States; and that it is the purpose of this Act to include all such areas in the System and to clarify the authorities applicable to the system. Congress further reaffirms, declares and directs that the promotion and regulation of the various areas of the National Park system, as defined in section Ic of this title, shall be consistent with and founded in the purpose established by section I of this title (the Organic Act provisions), to the common benefit of all the people of the United States. The authorization of activities shall be construed and the protection, management, and administration of these areas shall be conducted in light of the high public value and integrity of the National Park System and shall not be exercised in derogation of the values and purposes for which these various areas have been established, except as may have been or shall be directly and specifically provided by Congress.|16 USC Ia-I<ref>Management Policies 2001, U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service; December 2000</ref>}}\n\n===National Lakeshores===\n[[File:Pictured Rocks - Grand portal.jpg|thumb|Grand portal at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]]The first national lakeshores were created in 1966 from some of the remaining unspoiled or unique coastlines of the [[Great Lakes]]. The first lakeshores were [[Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore]] in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]] in Northwest Indiana.<ref name=Almanac/> In 1970, two additional lakeshores were added: [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] on Michigan's western shore on [[Lake Michigan]], and [[Apostle Islands National Lakeshore]] on [[Wisconsin|Wisconsin']]s [[Lake Superior]] shore.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\n===National Heritage Area===\nHeritage areas were first established to identify regions having a common cultural impact on the development of the United States.

Fourteen areas exited by November 12, 1996.<ref name=Almanac/>  Initially, all the heritage areas were in the east and northeast. Today, they exist from coast to coast.

Nixon|Richard Nixon]] presidency, public parks expanded with the creation of the two gateway parks.  [[Golden Gate National Recreation Area]] in [[San Francisco]] became the western book end to [[Gateway National Recreation Area]] in [[New York City]]. Both were specifically created to serve these two major urban areas and create open space, rather than to preserve a specific scenic or cultural value.<ref name=Almanac/>\n\nOn August 15, 1978, [[President Jimmy Carter]] signed into law the creation of the [[Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area]], comprising 15 park units, ranging over 5,000 acres, and included 48 miles of the [[Chattahoochee River]], in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].\n\n===The Alaska expansion===\n[[File:Lake Clark National Park.jpg|thumb|{{center|Lake Clark}}]]In 1977, President [[Jimmy Carter]] created a dozen national monuments, in Alaska. The controversy that ensued led to the passage of the [[Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act]] ('''ANILCA''').

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was characterized sociologically by a disproportionately large number of high status Americans as well as English immigrants; for example, more than a quarter of all [[President of the United States|presidents of the United States]] have been Episcopalians (''see [[List of United States Presidential religious affiliations]]''). Although it was not among the leading participants of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] in the early 19th century, by the early 20th century its social engagement had increased to the point that it was an important participant in the [[Social Gospel]] movement, though it never provided much support for the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibitionist movement]]. Like other [[Mainline Protestant|mainline churches]] in the United States, its membership decreased from the 1960s.

This version was adopted as the official prayer book in 1979 after an initial three-year trial use.

Objections to the ordination of women have been different from time to time and place to place. Some believe that it is fundamentally impossible for a woman to be validly ordained, while others believe it is possible but inappropriate. Considerations cited include local social conditions, ecumenical implications, or the symbolic character of the priesthood, an ancient tradition including an all-male priesthood, as well as certain biblical texts.\n\nFollowing upon [[Ordination of women#Anglicanism|years of discussion]] in the Episcopal Church and elsewhere, in 1976, the General Convention amended canon law to permit the [[ordination of women]] to the priesthood.

The next day the first ordinations on American soil took place when Henry Van Dyke, Philo Shelton, Ashbel Baldwin, and Colin Ferguson were ordained deacons. On August 7, 1785, Collin Ferguson was advanced to the priesthood, and Thomas Fitch Oliver was admitted to the diaconate.\n\n[[File:William White-Bishop Episcopal Church USA-1795.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)]].]]\n\nThat same year, clerical and lay representatives from seven of the nine states south of Connecticut held the first [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America]].

Thus, there are two branches of [[historical episcopate|Apostolic succession]] for American bishops:\n#Through the non-juring bishops of Scotland that consecrated Samuel Seabury.\n#Through the English church that consecrated William White and Samuel Provoost.\nAll bishops in the Episcopal Church are ordained by at least three bishops; one can trace the succession of each back to Seabury, White and Provoost (see [[Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church in the United States|Succession of Bishops of the Episcopal Church]]). The fourth bishop of the Episcopal Church was [[James Madison (Episcopal bishop)|James Madison]], the first [[Episcopal Diocese of Virginia|Bishop of Virginia]].

The Episcopal Church was formally separated from the Church of England in 1789 so that American clergy would not be required to accept the supremacy of the [[British monarch]].

However, in 1821, the General Convention created a [[General Seminary]] for the whole church and established the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In 1835, the General Convention declared that all members of the Episcopal Church were to constitute the membership of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society<ref>\"Constitution of the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society,\" in ''Journal of the Proceedings of the Bishops, Clergy, and Laity of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America in General Convention'(New York: Protestant Episcopal Press, 1835): 129.</ref> and elected the first domestic missionary bishop, [[Jackson Kemper]], for Missouri and Indiana. The first two foreign missionary bishops, [[William Jones Boone (father)|William Boone]] for China and [[Horatio Southgate]] for Constantinople, were elected in 1844. The church would later establish a presence in Japan and Liberia.

Only Thomas Atkinson of North Carolina and Henry C. Lay of Arkansas attended from the South. Atkinson, whose opinions represented his own diocese better than it did his fellow Southern bishops, did much nonetheless to represent the South while at the same time paving the way for reunion.

Katharine Jefferts Schori as the Church's 26th presiding bishop was controversial in the wider Anglican Communion because she is a woman and the full Anglican communion does not recognize the ordination of women. She is the only national leader of a church in the Anglican Communion who is a woman. Prior to her election she was [[Episcopal Diocese of Nevada|Bishop of Nevada]]. She was elected at the 75th General Convention on June 18, 2006, and invested at the [[Washington National Cathedral]] on November 4, 2006.\n\nJefferts Schori generated controversy when she voted to confirm openly gay Gene Robinson as a bishop and for allowing [[Blessing of same-sex unions in Christian churches|blessings of same-sex unions]] in her diocese of Nevada.\n\nDuring her time as Presiding Bishop, ten [[primate (bishop)|primates]] of the Anglican communion stated that they did not recognize Jefferts Schori as a primate.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In addition, eight American dioceses rejected her authority and asked [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] to assign them another national leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/3577_77919_ENG_HTM.htm |title=Episcopal Diocese of Quincy seeks alternative oversight |publisher=Episcopalchurch.org |accessdate=2008-11-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112061319/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/3577_77919_ENG_HTM.htm |archivedate=2008-11-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Conservative reactions to these developments===\n\nThese innovations have been responded to in various ways. The opposition to Ritualism produced the [[Reformed Episcopal Church]] in 1873. Opposition to the ordination of women priests and to theological revisions incorporated into the Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer led to the formation of the [[Continuing Anglican movement]] in 1977; and opposition to the consecration of the first ever openly homosexual bishop led to the creation of the [[Anglican Church in North America]].

In addition to those which have affiliated with one of the Continuing Anglican churches or the Anglican Church in North America, there are also congregations that have joined one of the Eastern Orthodox jurisdictions, [[Old Catholic]]ism, or the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nFive diocesan conventions have voted to withdraw from the Episcopal Church: the Diocese of San Joaquin, the Diocese of Fort Worth, the Diocese of Quincy, the Diocese of Pittsburgh, and the Diocese of South Carolina.

He was expelled from Jackson Christian after calling in a bomb threat. He applied for [[Jackson State Community College]] to study computers but, although his family believed he was indeed attending the school, he never provided documentation or pursued other steps to enroll there. Cowart moved to [[Texas]] in the spring of 2007 to live with friends he met on the Internet, but was unable to find work and returned to Bells to live with his grandparents a month later.<ref name=\"Jackson1029\">{{Citation |last=Martin |first=Mariann |title=Image of Daniel Cowart not familiar to those he knew in Bells |newspaper=[[The Jackson Sun]] |date=2008-10-29}}</ref> Cowart worked at a Bells grocery store called the Bells Market Place for one year until May 2007 before moving to Texas for a brief time. Cowart worked and got along with several minority co-workers, who later expressed shock at his arrest.

The club's president, Steve Edwards of [[Central City, Kentucky]], resigned due to the negative press following Cowart's arrest.

atop the list of largest percentage losses. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] reopened that day following a nearly four-and-a-half-month closure since July 30, 1914, and the Dow in fact rose several percent that day (from 71.42 to 74.56, or +4.4%). However, the apparent decline was due to a later 1916 revision of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which retroactively adjusted the values following the closure but not those before, and it represents the only discontinuity in the index's history rather than an actual loss.<ref>{{cite news  | title=Setting the Record Straight on the Dow Drop  | date=October 26, 1987  | work=[[The New York Times]]  | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F3EF935A15753C1A961948260  | access-date=February 17, 2017  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204203011/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F3EF935A15753C1A961948260  | archive-date=February 4, 2009  | url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/the-day-stocks-rose-but-the-dow-plunged-423/|title=The Day Stocks Rose but the Dow Plunged|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 1, 2008|first=Carl|last=Bialik|access-date=August 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408224751/http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/the-day-stocks-rose-but-the-dow-plunged-423/|archive-date=April 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-shown\">\n{|\n\n|'''Largest daily percentage gains<ref name=\"Spindices\"/>'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:#9f6;text-align:right\"\n! rowspan=2 | Rank\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Close\n! colspan=2 | Change\n|-\n!

However, the apparent decline was due to a later 1916 revision of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which retroactively adjusted the values following the closure but not those before, and it represents the only discontinuity in the index's history rather than an actual loss.<ref>{{cite news  | title=Setting the Record Straight on the Dow Drop  | date=October 26, 1987  | work=[[The New York Times]]  | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F3EF935A15753C1A961948260  | access-date=February 17, 2017  | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204203011/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE0D71F3EF935A15753C1A961948260  | archive-date=February 4, 2009  | url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/the-day-stocks-rose-but-the-dow-plunged-423/|title=The Day Stocks Rose but the Dow Plunged|publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 1, 2008|first=Carl|last=Bialik|access-date=August 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408224751/http://blogs.wsj.com/numbersguy/the-day-stocks-rose-but-the-dow-plunged-423/|archive-date=April 8, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-shown\">\n{|\n\n|'''Largest daily percentage gains<ref name=\"Spindices\"/>'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:#9f6;text-align:right\"\n! rowspan=2 | Rank\n! rowspan=2 | Date\n! rowspan=2 | Close\n! colspan=2 | Change\n|-\n!

It is located {{convert|8|km|mi|0}} north-east of the [[Sydney central business district]], in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]]s of [[Waverley Council]] and the [[Municipality of Woollahra]].\n\nVaucluse is located on the [[Sydney Heads|South Head]] peninsula, just South of [[The Gap (Sydney)|The Gap]] with [[Sydney Harbour]] on the west and the [[Tasman Sea]] to the east. The Sydney Harbour side of the suburb commands views across the harbour to the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. The adjacent suburbs are [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] to the north and [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] and [[Dover Heights, New South Wales|Dover Heights]] to the south.\n\nVaucluse is a mainly residential suburb. For many years it was the most affluent suburb in Sydney and as of May 2017, in terms of houses and properties, was in the top five most expensive suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realestate.com.au/news/most-expensive-suburbs-in-sydney/|title=Sydney's Most Expensive Suburbs Revealed|last=Cahill|first=Danielle|date=9 May 2017|website=www.realestate.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> ''Tahiti'', a [[Hawaii]]an-style residence in tropical gardens above Hermit Bay, set Australian residential record when it sold to a trio of South Africans (the Krok brothers) for more than {{AUD}}29&nbsp;million in September 2007.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/topical-paradise-fetches-29m/2007/09/28/1190486569822.html Topical paradise fetches $29m], 28 September 2007, smh.com.au</ref> The Australian residential record was overtaken by Leon Kamenev, the founder of [[Menulog]], purchasing four waterfront properties on prestigious Coolong Road for a combined {{AUD}}80&nbsp;million in April 2016.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 April 2016 |work=[[Domain Group]] |title=Russian refugee Leon Kamenev revealed as buyer of Australia's most expensive property amalgamation |url=http://www.domain.com.au/news/russian-refugee-leon-kamenev-revealed-as-buyer-of-australias-most-expensive-property-amalgamation-20160425-goe4jw/ |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of extensively high-worth properties in Vaucluse are located on the Western side of New South Head Rd towards the harbour, with less expensive housing and property being found closer East of New South Head Rd, around South Head Cemetery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onthehouse.com.au/real-estate/nsw/vaucluse-2030/|website=onthehouse.com.au|title=Vaucluse, NSW 2030|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore European settlement, the area where Vaucluse is now located was inhabited by the Birrabirragal aboriginal clan, who belonged to the coastal [[Darug language|Dharug]] language group. The first European activity in the area took place not long after settlement, when a makeshift signalling station was set up on the ridge overlooking the ocean. Its role was to signal the colony if a ship was approaching. Pilots based at Camp Cove, [[Watsons Bay]], could then meet the ship and guide it through the harbour. A formal signal station was established in 1790, serviced by a bridle trail that later became [[Old South Head Road, Sydney|Old South Head Road]] in 1811.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 1987, p.58</ref>\n[[File:Macquarie Lighthouse, Dunbar Head.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Macquarie Lighthouse]], Dunbar Head]]\nMacquarie Lighthouse was constructed on the ridge, a little south of the signal station, in 1816, having been designed by [[Francis Greenway]], the first notable architect in the colony. Residential use of the area also developed.\n\nThe original [[Vaucluse House]], from which the area derived its name, was built by [[Henry Browne Hayes|Sir Henry Browne Hayes]], who had been transported to [[New South Wales]] for kidnapping the granddaughter of a wealthy Irish banker. When he arrived, in 1802, he was allowed to buy land from that which was granted to Thomas Laycock in 1793 and Robert Cardell in 1795. The house was then acquired by [[John Piper (military officer)|Captain John Piper]] in 1822. Sir Henry Browne Hayes, an avid admirer of the 14th-century poet [[Petrarch]], named the house after Petrarch's poem about the famous [[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]] near the town [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]], currently in the Department of [[Vaucluse]] in southern [[France]]. In 1827, the small but charming cottage was bought by [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] (1790\u20131872), barrister and explorer and one of the men who had crossed the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] in 1813. Many structural changes and additions were made while he lived there until 1853. The building has fifteen bedrooms, is in the 1830s [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] and sits on {{convert|27|acre|ha|lk=on}} of gardens. It still survives and is listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p. 2/135</ref>\n\nIn the early 1840s, the present signal station was built by the Colonial Architect, [[Mortimer Lewis]]. It has continued to be used up to the present day for controlling shipping in and out of the harbour. Later in the same decade, more residential development occurred with the construction of Greycliffe House at Shark Beach by a son-in-law of William Charles Wentworth. It was a large, sandstone house in the \"Victorian Rustic Gothic\" style, attributed to the architect [[John Hilly]].<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Richard Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.90</ref> A succession of prominent Sydney identities leased the house during the 19th century. It was gutted by fire in the 1890s but fully restored. It is now used as the visitor centre for the Sydney Harbour National Park.\n\nAnother substantial residential development was the construction, in 1854\u201356, of Carrara on the harbour foreshores. Carrara was designed by John Hilly for John Hosking, the first Lord Mayor of Sydney. The house featured verandahs with Doric columns and was situated to take advantage of the harbour views. Its name was changed to Strickland House in 1915, when it was turned into a convalescent home for women.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, p.56</ref>\n\nBy 1871, the colony was experiencing the \"Russian scare\" that prevailed at the time, as a result of which fortifications were built at Steel Point, just a little north-west of Carrara. Cannon emplacements, powder magazine and embrasures, plus a store and barrack rooms, were constructed at this strategic point overlooking the harbour. The buildings were made of sandstone found at the site and still survive today; they are listed on the Register of the National Estate.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, p.2/134</ref>\n\n[[File:AUS-sydney-vaucluse.jpg|thumb|left|Vaucluse House]]  \n[[File:Vaucluse_Sydney.png|thumb|Vaucluse clifftop homes.]]\n[[File:Sydneycityscape.jpg|g|thumb|View of Vaucluse from the [[Tasman Sea]].]]\nNot long afterwards, Mortimer Lewis was designing a tomb for the Wentworth family. William Charles Wentworth died in England in 1872 and his remains were interred in the Victorian Gothic mausoleum that was constructed in Chapel Road, Vaucluse. Made of sandstone, the building featured a stained glass window in the west end and a clerestory window above the door.\n\nAround about the same time, [[Edward Mason Hunt]] was busy designing a Victorian Gothic mansion south of Carrara. This two-storey sandstone home incorporated a much smaller home built at that site by Alexander Dick, circa 1840; that home changed hands in 1868 and enlargement proceeded. The new mansion, known as [[The Hermitage, Vaucluse|The Hermitage]], featured multiple gables, a castellated tower and prominent fretwork. It was damaged by fire in 1936 but was restored by Emil Sodersten. It was bought in 1964 by the Woolworths company, which used it for some time as a training facility.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, p.54</ref>\n\nJust a little East of The Hermitage, St Michael's Church of England went up in 1877, after being designed by [[Edmund Blacket]]. Located in St Michael's Place, this new sandstone church  would later be enlarged in the 1930s, with the addition of a new spire, by Professor Leslie Wilkinson. The new design would eventually win the Sulman Prize for architecture in 1942. In 1928, the largest property purchase in the history of Vaucluse was completed by Bariston and Decima Ashton joining 8 adjoining blocks into one large single block of 2.25 acres. This record was surpassed in 2011 with the Department of Foreign Affairs purchase of 3 acres in lower Vaucluse.\n\nBy the 1880s, Greenway's Macquarie Lighthouse was in bad repair. In 1883, the Colonial Architect of the day, [[James Barnet]], built a new lighthouse which was virtually a perfect replica of the original one, and the original was demolished. Other buildings making up the group were the assistant lighthouse keepers' cottages, built circa 1881, and Greenway's keeper's cottage, dating from circa 1840. There are also remains of courtyards to earlier cottages and the stone base wall of the original lighthouse. The entire group is listed on the Register of the National Estate.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, p.2/138</ref>\n\n===Former military sites===\n[[File:Signal hill battery vc.jpg|thumb|left|Signal Hill Battery]]\nSeveral [[Template:Barracks Batteries Bunkers and Forts in Sydney|defensive fortifications]] are located on the shores and cliff tops of Vaucluse, such as the [[Signal Hill Battery]], constructed in 1892; it was intended to defend the town of Sydney from bombardment by an enemy vessel standing off the coast. Although the fortification has been heavily vandalised, it is still intact and lies adjacent to the Signal Hill, signal station.<ref>[http://www.bunkerboyz.org/signal.htm Bunker Boyz: Signal Hill Bunkers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/local_history_fast_facts/s Woollahra Municipal Council | Local history fast facts - S<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Steel Point Battery|Steel Point fortification]] in Nielsen Park was constructed in 1871; it originally accommodated three 80-pounder rifled muzzle-loaders (RMLs) that were replaced in the 1890s with [[BL 5 inch gun Mk I - V|5 inch breech-loading guns]]. The fortification was built at a time when fears of a Russian attack seemed imminent, as well as other concerns such as withdrawal of British garrison troops, threats to British dependencies and increasing self-reliance in defence matters. The battery consisted of three sandstone gun emplacements with embrasures for the guns to fire through. The gun emplacements were connected to underground chambers, as well as a gunpowder magazine, by open passages and underground passageways leading into the complex.<ref>[http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/nsw/Vaucluse/SharkPointBattery/7040 Shark Point Battery, Vaucluse, NSW Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/29/1083224522160.html?from=storyrhs Tunnels offer glimpse of a past besieged - National - www.smh.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the RAN degaussing station was constructed over part of the Steel Point fortification.<ref>http://www.navyhistory.org.au/the-battle-for-the-boom/</ref> The [[degaussing]] station was a countermeasure against magnetic mines. [[Shark Island (Port Jackson)|Shark Island]] was used for this purpose during World War II.

The adjacent suburbs are [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] to the north and [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] and [[Dover Heights, New South Wales|Dover Heights]] to the south.\n\nVaucluse is a mainly residential suburb. For many years it was the most affluent suburb in Sydney and as of May 2017, in terms of houses and properties, was in the top five most expensive suburbs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realestate.com.au/news/most-expensive-suburbs-in-sydney/|title=Sydney's Most Expensive Suburbs Revealed|last=Cahill|first=Danielle|date=9 May 2017|website=www.realestate.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-15}}</ref> ''Tahiti'', a [[Hawaii]]an-style residence in tropical gardens above Hermit Bay, set Australian residential record when it sold to a trio of South Africans (the Krok brothers) for more than {{AUD}}29&nbsp;million in September 2007.<ref >[http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/topical-paradise-fetches-29m/2007/09/28/1190486569822.html Topical paradise fetches $29m], 28 September 2007, smh.com.au</ref> The Australian residential record was overtaken by Leon Kamenev, the founder of [[Menulog]], purchasing four waterfront properties on prestigious Coolong Road for a combined {{AUD}}80&nbsp;million in April 2016.<ref>{{cite news |date=25 April 2016 |work=[[Domain Group]] |title=Russian refugee Leon Kamenev revealed as buyer of Australia's most expensive property amalgamation |url=http://www.domain.com.au/news/russian-refugee-leon-kamenev-revealed-as-buyer-of-australias-most-expensive-property-amalgamation-20160425-goe4jw/ |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe vast majority of extensively high-worth properties in Vaucluse are located on the Western side of New South Head Rd towards the harbour, with less expensive housing and property being found closer East of New South Head Rd, around South Head Cemetery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.onthehouse.com.au/real-estate/nsw/vaucluse-2030/|website=onthehouse.com.au|title=Vaucluse, NSW 2030|access-date=2019-03-24}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore European settlement, the area where Vaucluse is now located was inhabited by the Birrabirragal aboriginal clan, who belonged to the coastal [[Darug language|Dharug]] language group. The first European activity in the area took place not long after settlement, when a makeshift signalling station was set up on the ridge overlooking the ocean. Its role was to signal the colony if a ship was approaching. Pilots based at Camp Cove, [[Watsons Bay]], could then meet the ship and guide it through the harbour. A formal signal station was established in 1790, serviced by a bridle trail that later became [[Old South Head Road, Sydney|Old South Head Road]] in 1811.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 1987, p.58</ref>\n[[File:Macquarie Lighthouse, Dunbar Head.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Macquarie Lighthouse]], Dunbar Head]]\nMacquarie Lighthouse was constructed on the ridge, a little south of the signal station, in 1816, having been designed by [[Francis Greenway]], the first notable architect in the colony. Residential use of the area also developed.\n\nThe original [[Vaucluse House]], from which the area derived its name, was built by [[Henry Browne Hayes|Sir Henry Browne Hayes]], who had been transported to [[New South Wales]] for kidnapping the granddaughter of a wealthy Irish banker. When he arrived, in 1802, he was allowed to buy land from that which was granted to Thomas Laycock in 1793 and Robert Cardell in 1795. The house was then acquired by [[John Piper (military officer)|Captain John Piper]] in 1822. Sir Henry Browne Hayes, an avid admirer of the 14th-century poet [[Petrarch]], named the house after Petrarch's poem about the famous [[Fontaine de Vaucluse (spring)|Fontaine de Vaucluse]] near the town [[L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue]], currently in the Department of [[Vaucluse]] in southern [[France]]. In 1827, the small but charming cottage was bought by [[William Wentworth|William Charles Wentworth]] (1790\u20131872), barrister and explorer and one of the men who had crossed the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] in 1813. Many structural changes and additions were made while he lived there until 1853. The building has fifteen bedrooms, is in the 1830s [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] and sits on {{convert|27|acre|ha|lk=on}} of gardens. It still survives and is listed on the (now defunct) [[Register of the National Estate]].<ref>The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p. 2/135</ref>\n\nIn the early 1840s, the present signal station was built by the Colonial Architect, [[Mortimer Lewis]]. It has continued to be used up to the present day for controlling shipping in and out of the harbour. Later in the same decade, more residential development occurred with the construction of Greycliffe House at Shark Beach by a son-in-law of William Charles Wentworth. It was a large, sandstone house in the \"Victorian Rustic Gothic\" style, attributed to the architect [[John Hilly]].<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Richard Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.90</ref> A succession of prominent Sydney identities leased the house during the 19th century. It was gutted by fire in the 1890s but fully restored. It is now used as the visitor centre for the Sydney Harbour National Park.\n\nAnother substantial residential development was the construction, in 1854-56, of Carrara on the harbour foreshores. Carrara was designed by John Hilly for John Hosking, the first Lord Mayor of Sydney. The house featured verandahs with Doric columns and was situated to take advantage of the harbour views. Its name was changed to Strickland House in 1915, when it was turned into a convalescent home for women.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, p.56</ref> \n\nBy 1871, the colony was experiencing the \"Russian scare\" that prevailed at the time, as a result of which fortifications were built at Steel Point, just a little north-west of Carrara. Cannon emplacements, powder magazine and embrasures, plus a store and barrack rooms, were constructed at this strategic point overlooking the harbour. The buildings were made of sandstone found at the site and still survive today; they are listed on the Register of the National Estate.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, p.2/134</ref>\n\n[[File:AUS-sydney-vaucluse.jpg|thumb|left|Vaucluse House]]  \n[[File:Vaucluse_Sydney.png|thumb|Vaucluse clifftop homes.]]\n[[File:Sydneycityscape.jpg|g|thumb|View of Vaucluse from the [[Tasman Sea]].]]\nNot long afterwards, Mortimer Lewis was designing a tomb for the Wentworth family. William Charles Wentworth died in England in 1872 and his remains were interred in the Victorian Gothic mausoleum that was constructed in Chapel Road, Vaucluse. Made of sandstone, the building featured a stained glass window in the west end and a clerestory window above the door.\n\nAround about the same time, [[Edward Mason Hunt]] was busy designing a Victorian Gothic mansion south of Carrara. This two-storey sandstone home incorporated a much smaller home built at that site by Alexander Dick, circa 1840; that home changed hands in 1868 and enlargement proceeded. The new mansion, known as [[The Hermitage, Vaucluse|The Hermitage]], featured multiple gables, a castellated tower and prominent fretwork. It was damaged by fire in 1936 but was restored by Emil Sodersten. It was bought in 1964 by the Woolworths company, which used it for some time as a training facility.<ref>Walks in the Sydney Harbour National Park, p.54</ref>\n\nJust a little East of The Hermitage, St Michael's Church of England went up in 1877, after being designed by [[Edmund Blacket]]. Located in St Michael's Place, this new sandstone church  would later be enlarged in the 1930s, with the addition of a new spire, by Professor Leslie Wilkinson. The new design would eventually win the Sulman Prize for architecture in 1942. In 1928, the largest property purchase in the history of Vaucluse was completed by Bariston and Decima Ashton joining 8 adjoining blocks into one large single block of 2.25 acres. This record was surpassed in 2011 with the Department of Foreign Affairs purchase of 3 acres in lower Vaucluse.\n\nBy the 1880s, Greenway's Macquarie Lighthouse was in bad repair. In 1883, the Colonial Architect of the day, [[James Barnet]], built a new lighthouse which was virtually a perfect replica of the original one, and the original was demolished. Other buildings making up the group were the assistant lighthouse keepers' cottages, built circa 1881, and Greenway's keeper's cottage, dating from circa 1840. There are also remains of courtyards to earlier cottages and the stone base wall of the original lighthouse. The entire group is listed on the Register of the National Estate.<ref>The Heritage of Australia, p.2/138</ref>\n\n===Former military sites===\n[[File:Signal hill battery vc.jpg|thumb|left|Signal Hill Battery]]\nSeveral [[Template:Barracks Batteries Bunkers and Forts in Sydney|defensive fortifications]] are located on the shores and cliff tops of Vaucluse, such as the [[Signal Hill Battery]], constructed in 1892; it was intended to defend the town of Sydney from bombardment by an enemy vessel standing off the coast. Although the fortification has been heavily vandalised, it is still intact and lies adjacent to the Signal Hill, signal station.<ref>[http://www.bunkerboyz.org/signal.htm Bunker Boyz: Signal Hill Bunkers<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/library/local_history/local_history_fast_facts/s Woollahra Municipal Council | Local history fast facts - S<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe [[Steel Point Battery|Steel Point fortification]] in Nielsen Park was constructed in 1871; it originally accommodated three 80 pounder rifled muzzle-loaders (RMLs) that were replaced in the 1890s with [[BL 5 inch gun Mk I - V|5 inch breech-loading guns]]. The fortification was built at a time when fears of a Russian attack seemed imminent, as well as other concerns such as withdrawal of British garrison troops, threats to British dependencies and increasing self-reliance in defence matters. The battery consisted of three sandstone gun emplacements with embrasures for the guns to fire through. The gun emplacements were connected to underground chambers, as well as a gunpowder magazine, by open passages and underground passageways leading into the complex.<ref>[http://www.aussieheritage.com.au/listings/nsw/Vaucluse/SharkPointBattery/7040 Shark Point Battery, Vaucluse, NSW Profile<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/29/1083224522160.html?from=storyrhs Tunnels offer glimpse of a past besieged - National - www.smh.com.au<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, the RAN degaussing station was constructed over part of the Steel Point fortification.<ref>http://www.navyhistory.org.au/the-battle-for-the-boom/</ref> The [[degaussing]] station was a countermeasure against magnetic mines.

The position of the clubs was based on the percentage of matches won with only matches against other clubs in the table counting.\n\nSunday Telegraph English Champions 1964 to 1987:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*1963-64 London Scottish\n*1964-65 London Scottish\n*1965-66 Bristol\n*1966-67 London Welsh\n*1967-68 London Welsh\n*1968-69 London Welsh\n*1969-70 Coventry\n*1970-71 London Welsh\n*1971-72 Bristol\n*1972-73 Coventry\n*1973-74 Bristol\n*1974-75 Rosslyn Park\n*1975-76 Northampton\n*1976-77 Moseley\n*1977-78 London Welsh\n*1978-79 London Welsh\n*1979-80 Leicester\n*1980-81 Leicester\n*1981-82 Gloucester\n*1982-83 Coventry\n*1983-84 Wasps\n*1984-85 Bath\n*1985-86 Leicester\n*1986-87 Bath\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Precursor competitions==\nWhile there were experiments with county leagues in the north in the nineteenth century<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rugby League Myth |first1=Michael |last1=Latham |first2=Tom |last2=Mather}}</ref> for most of rugby union's history there have been no organised leagues. The 1970s saw the creation of a national cup and a series of regional and county merit leagues (the most important of which being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit league).\n\nIn 1984 this was taken one step further with the creation of two national merit leagues for the top twenty four clubs (based around playing a minimum of sixteen fixtures against each other, a factor which led to Exeter's exclusion after consideration). The top division had three clubs from each of the major merit leagues. In these clubs had to play a minimum of eight fixtures against the other clubs in their division but it was largely based around pre-existing fixtures. There was a system of promotion and relegation between the Merit Tables. 1985 saw the addition of a third national merit table, albeit without promotion and relegation to the top two.\n\n===1984\u201385 season===\nThe initial lineups of the merit tables was as follows:\n\n'''Merit Table A'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bath\n*Bristol\n*Coventry\n*Gloucester\n*Gosforth\n*Harlequins\n*Leicester\n*London Irish\n*London Scottish\n*Moseley\n*Orrell\n*Sale\n{{div col end}}\n'''Merit Table B'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bedford\n*Blackheath\n*Headingley\n*Liverpool\n*London Welsh\n*Northampton\n*Nottingham\n*Richmond\n*Rosslyn Park\n*Saracens\n*Wasps\n*Waterloo\n{{div col end}}\n'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:\n*Relegated: Coventry; London Irish; Orrell\n'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted: Headingley; Nottingham; Wasps\n\n===1985\u201386===\nThis year saw the creation of '''Merit Table C''' with the following clubs:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birmingham\n*Exeter\n*Fylde\n*Metropolitan Police\n*Morley\n*Nuneaton\n*Plymouth\n*Roundhay\n*Sheffield\n*Vale of Lune\n*Wakefield\n*West Hartlepool\n{{div col end}}\n*'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:Gloucester\n*Relegated: Gosforth; Headingley<ref>{{cite book|title=Rothmans Rugby Yearbook 1986-87|year=1986|publisher=Queen Anne Press|location=London|editor=Stephen Jones}}</ref>\n*'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted: 1st Orrell; 2nd Coventry;\n*Liverpool merge with non-league St Helens to become Liverpool-St Helens\n*'''Merit Table C'''\n*Champions (not promoted):\n\n===1986\u201387===\n\n*'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:\n*Relegated to National 2: London Scottish\n*'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted into National 1: Waterloo\n*'''Merit Table C'''\n*Champions (not promoted):\n*Relegated to Area League North: Roundhay\n*Admitted to National 3: Maidstone\n\n==Foundation of the national league system==\nIn 1987 the merit tables formed the basis of the top three divisions of the national league system. For the first season there were no fixed fixtures so clubs had to arrange their own (to a minimum of ten out of eleven opponents, only one game against each club could count). For the initial season there was no promotion and relegation between National 2 and National 3 but this was created for the following season. National 3 had a minimum of two clubs per region (with the top four clubs in the previous season's Merit Table C getting a guaranteed spot outside this quota) thus Roundhay missed out on a spot to Maidstone.\n\nIn 1988 clubs had their fixtures set by the league for them though still only played each other once.\n\n===Initial composition of major leagues===\n'''National 1'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bath\n*Bristol\n*Coventry\n*Gloucester\n*Harlequins\n*Leicester\n*Moseley\n*Nottingham\n*Orrell\n*Sale\n*Wasps\n*Waterloo\n{{div col end}}\n'''National 2'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bedford\n*Blackheath\n*Gosforth\n*Headingley\n*Liverpool-St Helens\n*London Irish\n*London Scottish\n*London Welsh\n*Northampton\n*Richmond\n*Rosslyn Park\n*Saracens\n{{div col end}}\n'''National 3'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birmingham\n*Exeter\n*Fylde\n*Maidstone\n*Metropolitan Police\n*Morley\n*Nuneaton\n*Plymouth\n*Sheffield\n*Vale of Lune\n*Wakefield\n*West Hartlepool\n{{div col end}}\n'''Area League North'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birkenhead Park\n*Broughton Park\n*Derby\n*Durham City\n*Lichfield\n*Northern\n*Preston Grasshoppers\n*Roundhay\n*Rugby\n*Solihull\n*Stourbridge\n{{div col end}}\n'''Area League South'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Askeans\n*Camborne\n*Cheltenham\n*Havant\n*Lydney\n*Salisbury\n*Sidcup\n*Southend\n*Streatham-Croydon\n*Stroud\n*Sudbury\n{{div col end}}\n\n===1987\u201388 season===\n{{main|1987-88 Courage League}}\n\n'''National 1'''\n{{col begin}}\n{{col 2}}\n*Champions: Leicester\n*Relegated: Coventry;

The second tier was reduced to twelve teams and rebranded the [[RFU Championship]] with a play-off system and only one relegation spot. National 2 and 3 (North and South) reverted to National 1 and National 2 (North and South), and were expanded to sixteen teams. Four National 3 divisions were created based around the top regional leagues with fourteen teams in each (see above). National play-offs for the title were created for the winners of the National 2 and National 3 divisions. A similar play-off series was created for the eight winners of the regional divisions.\n\n'''Premiership'''\n*Champions: Leicester\n*Relegated: Worcester\n*'''Championship'''\n*Promoted: Exeter\n*Relegated: Coventry\n'''National 1'''\n*Promoted: Esher\n*Relegated: Manchester;

Likewise the leagues started off amateur but professionalism has since been permitted. However, it has always had three or four national leagues with various regional and county leagues below.\n\n==Sunday Telegraph Merit Tables==\n''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' published Merit Tables for the leading English clubs from the 1960s to the 1980s. The position of the clubs was based on the percentage of matches won with only matches against other clubs in the table counting.\n\nSunday Telegraph English Champions 1964 to 1987:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*1963-64 London Scottish\n*1964-65 London Scottish\n*1965-66 Bristol\n*1966-67 London Welsh\n*1967-68 London Welsh\n*1968-69 London Welsh\n*1969-70 Coventry\n*1970-71 London Welsh\n*1971-72 Bristol\n*1972-73 Coventry\n*1973-74 Bristol\n*1974-75 Rosslyn Park\n*1975-76 Northampton\n*1976-77 Moseley\n*1977-78 London Welsh\n*1978-79 London Welsh\n*1979-80 Leicester\n*1980-81 Leicester\n*1981-82 Gloucester\n*1982-83 Coventry\n*1983-84 Wasps\n*1984-85 Bath\n*1985-86 Leicester\n*1986-87 Bath\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Precursor competitions==\nWhile there were experiments with county leagues in the north in the nineteenth century<ref>{{cite book |title=The Rugby League Myth |first1=Michael |last1=Latham |first2=Tom |last2=Mather}}</ref> for most of rugby union's history there have been no organised leagues. The 1970s saw the creation of a national cup and a series of regional and county merit leagues (the most important of which being the North, Midlands, South West and London merit league).\n\nIn 1984 this was taken one step further with the creation of two national merit leagues for the top twenty four clubs (based around playing a minimum of sixteen fixtures against each other, a factor which led to Exeter's exclusion after consideration). The top division had three clubs from each of the major merit leagues. In these clubs had to play a minimum of eight fixtures against the other clubs in their division but it was largely based around pre-existing fixtures. There was a system of promotion and relegation between the Merit Tables. 1985 saw the addition of a third national merit table, albeit without promotion and relegation to the top two.\n\n===1984\u201385 season===\nThe initial lineups of the merit tables was as follows:\n\n'''Merit Table A'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bath\n*Bristol\n*Coventry\n*Gloucester\n*Gosforth\n*Harlequins\n*Leicester\n*London Irish\n*London Scottish\n*Moseley\n*Orrell\n*Sale\n{{div col end}}\n'''Merit Table B'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bedford\n*Blackheath\n*Headingley\n*Liverpool\n*London Welsh\n*Northampton\n*Nottingham\n*Richmond\n*Rosslyn Park\n*Saracens\n*Wasps\n*Waterloo\n{{div col end}}\n'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:\n*Relegated: Coventry; London Irish; Orrell\n'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted: Headingley; Nottingham; Wasps\n\n===1985\u201386===\nThis year saw the creation of '''Merit Table C''' with the following clubs:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birmingham\n*Exeter\n*Fylde\n*Metropolitan Police\n*Morley\n*Nuneaton\n*Plymouth\n*Roundhay\n*Sheffield\n*Vale of Lune\n*Wakefield\n*West Hartlepool\n{{div col end}}\n*'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:Gloucester\n*Relegated: Gosforth; Headingley<ref>{{cite book|title=Rothmans Rugby Yearbook 1986-87|year=1986|publisher=Queen Anne Press|location=London|editor=Stephen Jones}}</ref>\n*'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted: 1st Orrell; 2nd Coventry;\n*Liverpool merge with non-league St Helens to become Liverpool-St Helens\n*'''Merit Table C'''\n*Champions (not promoted):\n\n===1986\u201387===\n\n*'''Merit Table A'''\n*Champions:\n*Relegated to National 2: London Scottish\n*'''Merit Table B'''\n*Promoted into National 1: Waterloo\n*'''Merit Table C'''\n*Champions (not promoted):\n*Relegated to Area League North: Roundhay\n*Admitted to National 3: Maidstone\n\n==Foundation of the national league system==\nIn 1987 the merit tables formed the basis of the top three divisions of the national league system. For the first season there were no fixed fixtures so clubs had to arrange their own (to a minimum of ten out of eleven opponents, only one game against each club could count). For the initial season there was no promotion and relegation between National 2 and National 3 but this was created for the following season. National 3 had a minimum of two clubs per region (with the top four clubs in the previous season's Merit Table C getting a guaranteed spot outside this quota) thus Roundhay missed out on a spot to Maidstone.\n\nIn 1988 clubs had their fixtures set by the league for them though still only played each other once.\n\n===Initial composition of major leagues===\n'''National 1'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bath\n*Bristol\n*Coventry\n*Gloucester\n*Harlequins\n*Leicester\n*Moseley\n*Nottingham\n*Orrell\n*Sale\n*Wasps\n*Waterloo\n{{div col end}}\n'''National 2'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Bedford\n*Blackheath\n*Gosforth\n*Headingley\n*Liverpool-St Helens\n*London Irish\n*London Scottish\n*London Welsh\n*Northampton\n*Richmond\n*Rosslyn Park\n*Saracens\n{{div col end}}\n'''National 3'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birmingham\n*Exeter\n*Fylde\n*Maidstone\n*Metropolitan Police\n*Morley\n*Nuneaton\n*Plymouth\n*Sheffield\n*Vale of Lune\n*Wakefield\n*West Hartlepool\n{{div col end}}\n'''Area League North'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Birkenhead Park\n*Broughton Park\n*Derby\n*Durham City\n*Lichfield\n*Northern\n*Preston Grasshoppers\n*Roundhay\n*Rugby\n*Solihull\n*Stourbridge\n{{div col end}}\n'''Area League South'''\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Askeans\n*Camborne\n*Cheltenham\n*Havant\n*Lydney\n*Salisbury\n*Sidcup\n*Southend\n*Streatham-Croydon\n*Stroud\n*Sudbury\n{{div col end}}\n\n===1987\u201388 season===\n{{main|1987-88 Courage League}}\n\n'''National 1'''\n{{col begin}}\n{{col 2}}\n*Champions: Leicester\n*Relegated: Coventry;
