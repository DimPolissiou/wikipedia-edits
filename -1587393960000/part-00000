While renovating, they discover a large, steel door that leads to a seemingly empty room. After experiencing frequent electrical shortages, the couple call an electrician out to the property to learn that the wiring in the home is comprised of a large, tangled mass that runs along the walls and floorboards of the property. As the electrician drives off, he exclaims his surprise that the property finally sold considering the previous owners were murdered on site. \n\nThat evening, Matt finds himself unable to sleep and ends up drinking while researching the murder. He learns that the killer's name is John Doe, and that he is still alive, housed in a psychiatric hospital. He stumbles into the room and drunkenly wishes for another bottle of alcohol, which the room promptly grants him. The next morning, Kate finds Matt in the room surrounded by many expensive paintings. He encourages her to wish for money- and she does, wishing for millions. Over the next several days, the couple quits their jobs and parties in the room, which continuously grants their wishes and desires.\n\nKate begins to fall under a depression when she realizes that nothing they wish for has any real value, stating that she can just get \"another, and another, and another\". To cheer her up, Matt tells her he wants to try for a child, but she becomes angry, revealing to the audience that the couple experienced two miscarriages in the past. She exclaims that she can't put herself through that pain again and storms out of the room. Matt walks past the bedroom moments later to discover that in her sadness, Kate used the room to wish for a son. Panicked, he tells her that what she has done is wrong and that she needs to force the room to take it back. When the couple is unable to bring themselves to wish away the child, Matt leaves the home in search of John Doe.\n\nAt the hospital, Matt speaks with John Doe and doesn't learn much, but is warned that he and his wife should leave the house and forget about the room. Matt drives away only to find that the money he placed in his pocket has turned to ash. He tests his theory at home by placing his Van Gogh painting partially over the threshold. As he suspected, anything that leaves the home experiences rapid aging and decay. Just as he comes to this realization, Kate tells Matt she is taking the baby out for some fresh air. He warns her not to do so but she ignores him, only to panic when the baby quickly ages into a young child. \n\nOver the next three months, the couple\u2019s marriage begins to fall apart as Kate attempts to parent the child, whom she calls \"Shane\", while Matt chooses to ignore the child entirely. Kate experiences frustration daily as she is inexperienced and unable to properly discipline the child. Shane frequently grows impatient with his mother as she refuses to let him outside, citing \u201cgerms and bacteria\u201d rather then telling him the truth. \u00a0Days later, Matt finds that Shane has discovered the powers of the room, prompting a tense fight between the couple. They are interrupted by a call from John Doe, who reveals to Matt that he was a child wish granted by the room, and in order for Shane to live, Kate must die. Kate overhears the conversation and flees the home in an attempt to crash her car but cannot bring herself to do so. When she returns, the couple reunite tearfully and have sex in the kitchen, unknowingly being watched by Shane.\n\nThe next morning, they are awoken by the slamming of the front door and discover to their horror that Shane went outside and aged himself into a grown man. Though he appears to be an adult, he still has the mindset of a child. He angrily exclaims that Kate lied to him about everything. He threatens the couple with Matt's gun but is distracted by Kate telling him she promised they could be together forever. Matt rushes Shane and knocks him to the floor, pushing his wife into the piano during the scuffle. When she awakens, Matt tells her he killed Shane while they fought for the gun. Though she is heartbroken by the news, she accepts the outcome. As they sit in the kitchen, she tells him she can no longer bear to live in the house, but is surprised when Matt disagrees, citing their lack of work and that they have \u201cno where else to go\u201d. He begins crunching on the ice in his drink and Kate realizes in horror that he is not her true husband- that he is Shane in disguise. She pushes him away, but Shane overpowers and attempts to rape her. \n\nAs this is happening, the real Matt comes to and quickly realizes what happened. Unable to break through the locked door, Matt tunnels through the walls next to the room and manages to break into the alternate \u201coutside\u201d that Shane created. He locates their replicated property and breaks into the home just as Shane is assaulting Kate. The two Matts come face-to-face with one another and try to sway Kate to their side.

While renovating, they discover a large, steel door that leads to a seemingly empty room. After experiencing frequent electrical shortages, the couple call an electrician out to the property to learn that the wiring in the home is comprised of a large, tangled mass that runs along the walls and floorboards of the property. As the electrician drives off, he exclaims his surprise that the property finally sold considering the previous owners were murdered on site. \n\nThat evening, Matt finds himself unable to sleep and ends up drinking while researching the murder. He learns that the killer's name is John Doe, and that he is still alive, housed in a psychiatric hospital. He stumbles into the room and drunkenly wishes for another bottle of alcohol, which the room promptly grants him. The next morning, Kate finds Matt in the room surrounded by many expensive paintings. He encourages her to wish for money- and she does, wishing for millions. Over the next several days, the couple quits their jobs and parties in the room, which continuously grants their wishes and desires.\n\nKate begins to fall under a depression when she realizes that nothing they wish for has any real value, stating that she can just get \"another, and another, and another\". To cheer her up, Matt tells her he wants to try for a child, but she becomes angry, revealing to the audience that the couple experienced two miscarriages in the past. She exclaims that she can't put herself through that pain again and storms out of the room. Matt walks past the bedroom moments later to discover that in her sadness, Kate used the room to wish for a son. Panicked, he tells her that what she has done is wrong and that she needs to force the room to take it back. When the couple is unable to bring themselves to wish away the child, Matt leaves the home in search of John Doe.\n\nAt the hospital, Matt speaks with John Doe and doesn't learn much, but is warned that he and his wife should leave the house and forget about the room. Matt drives away only to find that the money he placed in his pocket has turned to ash. He tests his theory at home by placing his Van Gogh painting partially over the threshold. As he suspected, anything that leaves the home experiences rapid aging and decay. Just as he comes to this realization, Kate tells Matt she is taking the baby out for some fresh air. He warns her not to do so but she ignores him, only to panic when the baby quickly ages into a young child. \n\nOver the next three months, the couple\u2019s marriage begins to fall apart as Kate attempts to parent the child, whom she calls \"Shane\", while Matt chooses to ignore the child entirely. Kate experiences frustration daily as she is inexperienced and unable to properly discipline the child. Shane frequently grows impatient with his mother as she refuses to let him outside, citing \u201cgerms and bacteria\u201d rather then telling him the truth. \u00a0Days later, Matt finds that Shane has discovered the powers of the room, prompting a tense fight between the couple. They are interrupted by a call from John Doe, who reveals to Matt that he was a child wish granted by the room, and in order for Shane to live, Kate must die. Kate overhears the conversation and flees the home in an attempt to crash her car but cannot bring herself to do so. When she returns, the couple reunite tearfully and have sex in the kitchen, unknowingly being watched by Shane.\n\nThe next morning, they are awoken by the slamming of the front door and discover to their horror that Shane went outside and aged himself into a grown man. Though he appears to be an adult, he still has the mindset of a child. He angrily exclaims that Kate lied to him about everything. He threatens the couple with Shane's gun but is distracted by Kate telling him she promised they could be together forever. Matt rushes Shane and knocks him to the floor, pushing his wife into the piano during the scuffle. When she awakens, Matt tells her he killed Shane while they fought for the gun. Though she is heartbroken by the news, she accepts the outcome. As they sit in the kitchen, she tells him she can no longer bear to live in the house, but is surprised when Matt disagrees, citing their lack of work and that they have \u201cno where else to go\u201d. He begins crunching on the ice in his drink and Kate realizes in horror that he is not her true husband- that he is Shane in disguise. She pushes him away, but Shane overpowers and attempts to rape her. \n\nAs this is happening, the real Matt comes to and quickly realizes what happened. Unable to break through the locked door, Matt tunnels through the walls next to the room and manages to break into the alternate \u201coutside\u201d that Shane created. He locates their replicated property and breaks into the home just as Shane is assaulting Kate. The two Matts come face-to-face with one another and try to sway Kate to their side. After pushing the fake Matt down the stairs, the couple flees the house makes their way back to the room. They manage to trick Shane into going outside into the real world. Locking the door behind her, Kate tearfully watches as her son ages rapidly, crumbling into ash. \n\nA month later, the couple has abandoned the home and moved to a nearby motel.

Retrieved 27 January 2009.</ref> which has been represented by [[Kieran Mullan]] since the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 General Election]].\n\n== History of Willaston ==\nWillaston is believed to have taken its name from an ancient farmstead known as Wiglaf's tun. Like other English villages, the name has been changed many times over the centuries. This is due to the neighbouring parish of Wistaston having a similar sounding name. To add confusion, Willaston was once ecclesiastically divided between the neighbouring communities of Nantwich and Wybunbury.\n\n\n\nWhilst there are at least two other villages called Willaston, the earliest documentary evidence relating to Willaston in this part of Cheshire can be found in the [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] survey of 1086, where is it referred to as Wilavestune. We know by reading this document that a 'free man' by the name of Ulviet once owned Wilvastune and that, just a few years after the Norman conquest, the title passed to Willam Malbank. The manor of Wilvastune remained in the Malbank family for several generations before ownership transferred to the Chanu family in the 13th century.\n\nAt this time, Willaston was a remote, sparsely populated community with no village centre. Nevertheless, it covered a much larger area than it does today, stretching from Newcastle Road and London Road Nantwich in the south, along Millstone Lane and as far as the ancient grazing land of Beam Heath in the north. These boundaries did not change until 1936, when local government decided to transfer some of Willaston's land to the expanding communities of [[Nantwich]] and Stapeley. In 1553, the manor of Willaston was bought by Richard Sneyd. Recorder of Chester. The Sneyd family lived at [[Keele Hall]] in Staffordshire and were the major landowners in WIllaston until the middle of the 19th century. \n\nAlthough Willaston had a number of farmsteads in the middle ages, most of the surrounding landscape was uncultivated. However, this began to change as more and more common land began to fall into private ownership during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The process (known as 'enclosure') brought major changes to rural communities such as Willaston, as individual plots of land were fenced off and used for arable farming, meadows and the grazing of livestock. The Sneyd family were absentee landlords but they owned most of the lands in Willaston from 1533 to the late 19th century. \n\nUnfortunately, the medieval moated site of the Chanu family was lost during the construction of the Nantwich by-pass in 1989. It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://willastonparishcouncil.org.uk/files/Willaston_Parish_Plan_2009.pdf|title=Willaston Parish Plan - History of Willaston|last=|first=|date=|website=Willaston Parish Council|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Local amenities==\nThe village centre of Willaston has two [[public house]]s (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an [[off-licence]] provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the [[A534 road|A534]]). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by [[Premier Inn]].\n \nThe social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts.  The club has two pool teams, a [[snooker]] team, two 7-a-side [[Association football|football]] teams, a darts and [[dominoes]] team and a ladies [[darts]] team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished.\n\nThe village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel). At the edge of the village is a farm shop, Cheerbrook,<ref>[http://www.cheerbrook.co.uk Cheerbrook Farm's Official Website] . Retrieved 31 January 2009.</ref> on the Newcastle Road.
