Students have also prepared a writ of certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court. In short, students represent the immigrants most in need of free, competent, ethical representation. In addition, students conduct community education programs at local community organizations, and participate in legislative advocacy at the federal level in conjunction with the American Immigration Lawyer's Association (AILA), and independently at the local level.\n\n== Noted alumni and faculty ==\n{{main|List of Pace University people}}\n* [[Ruth Noem\u00ed Col\u00f3n]] - was the 66th [[Secretary of State of New York]]\n* [[Philip M.

Harris and Klebold simultaneously committed [[suicide]] in the library, where they had killed ten of their victims. This became known as the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. Harris and Klebold were [[senior (education)|senior]]s at the school, making the attack just weeks before the pair were due to graduate. The ''[[Napa Valley Register]]'' has called them \"cultural icons\" for disenfranchised youth. Harris and Klebold's shooting spree still remains one of the most infamous shootings in history. The shooting would also go on to cause a massive moral panic in society, leading more schools to implement [[Zero tolerance (schools)|zero tolerance policies]].\n\nHarris and Klebold were both born in 1981. While Klebold stayed situated all of his life in Colorado, Harris moved around frequently due to his father being a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] transport pilot. Harris finally settled in [[Littleton, Colorado]], in 1993, when his father was forced to retire. Harris and Klebold had met sometime while they were in the 7th grade at Ken Caryl Middle School. Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

The weekend before the shootings, Harris and Klebold had purchased propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store for a few hundred dollars. Several residents of the area claimed to have heard glass breaking and buzzing sounds from the Harris family's garage, which later was concluded to indicate they were constructing pipe bombs.

Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be \"god-like\". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word \"WRATH\" printed in red.<ref name=USAToday/> It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He furthermore wrote that what fun is life without death. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place.

Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making.

Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.<ref name=\"No easy answers\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books | author1=Brown, Brooks | author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1/page/n67 68]\u201370 | isbn=1590560310 | access-date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nInvestigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

Over time, they became increasingly close. By the time they were juniors, they were described as inseparable. There are differing reports: some say Harris and Klebold were very unpopular students and frequent targets of bullying, while others say they weren't near the bottom of the school's social hierarchy and each had many friends. The pair were known to have near opposite personalities. Harris was described by his peers as more outgoing and [[charisma]]tic, while Klebold was known to be more quiet and shy. They were both arrested in January 1998 for breaking into a van and stealing equipment. They got into a [[Diversion program|diversionary program]], to help the boys stay out of any more trouble by going to frequent meetings with their psychiatrists and doing community service, while expunging their [[criminal record]]s if they passed, which they successfully did at the beginning of 1999. From their journal entries, Harris and Klebold had seemed to begin planning the attack by May 1998. Throughout the next year, Harris and Klebold meticulously built explosives and gathered an arsenal of weapons. The pair left behind many journal writings and home videos, foreshadowing the massacre and explaining their actions, with what they hoped to achieve. They would often cite the 1995 [[Oklahoma City Bombing]] as an inspiration and as a goal to surpass the bombing's casualties.\n\nAfter the massacre, it was widely believed Harris and Klebold were part of a [[clique]] in school called the \"Trenchcoat Mafia\", a group of misfits in the school who supposedly rebelled against the jocks. This turned out to be untrue, as neither Harris nor Klebold had any affiliation with the group. Others attributed bullying, mental illness or poor parenting to the attack. The answer proved not to be simple to investigators, but the pair's journals and recordings gave insight into Harris and Klebold's mindsets. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] concluded that Harris was a brooding [[psychopathy|psychopath]], who showed in his journal writings a lack of empathy, [[narcissism]] and unconstrained aggression. Klebold, however, was concluded as an angry [[Major depressive disorder|depressive]]. Klebold showed in his journal writings great agony and feeling of no self-worth, who wanted to get revenge on those who did him wrong. Since neither Harris or Klebold were diagnosed with any mental disorders prior to the attack, it is unclear if they suffered from any mental illness. Klebold's mother believes the pair had a \"magnetic attraction\" to one another. The FBI's conclusion is often disputed, such as people arguing Harris was also depressed because he took the anti-depressant [[Fluvoxamine|Luvox]]; and Klebold was the first to mention a killing spree in a 1997 journal entry. The [[motive (law)|motive]] for the attack remains inconclusive.\n\nHarris and Klebold have had a significant impact on [[popular culture]], with the pair often [[Columbine High School massacre in popular culture|seen, depicted and referenced]] through movies, television shows, video games, music, stage plays, documentaries and books. Many killers since the Columbine massacre [[Columbine effect|have taken inspiration]] from the two, hailing them as heroes, icons and martyrs. Harris and Klebold also have a fanbase who call themselves \"Columbiners\", who make blog posts, [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]] on them. Others have also dressed as Harris and Klebold for [[Halloween]] or [[cosplay]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Eric Harris===\n{{redirect|Eric Harris}}\n'''Eric David Harris''' was born on April 9, 1981 in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]]. Eric's parents were both born in Colorado but while his father Wayne Harris was working in the Air Force as a transport pilot, Wayne held 11 different positions at six different bases in [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]] and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Plattsburgh, New York]] was the last place the family moved to before Wayne's forced retirement from the military in 1993 due to cutbacks. His mother, Katherine Ann Poole, was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. The family moved to [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]], [[Colorado]], in July 1993.<ref name=\"Suspects\" />\n\nThe Harris family lived in rented accommodations for the first three years that they lived in the Littleton area. While Harris was in 7th grade, he met Dylan Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased and settled at a house south of Columbine High School. Eric's older brother, Kevin, attended college at the [[University of Colorado Boulder|University of Colorado]].<ref name=\"sides\">{{cite news |author1=Briggs, Bill |author2=Blevins, Jason |url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |title=A Boy With Many Sides |date=May 2, 1999 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |access-date=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027201910/http://extras.denverpost.com/news/shot0502b.htm |archive-date=October 27, 2011 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |title=Columbine killer envisioned crashing plane in NYC |date=December 6, 2001 |publisher=CNN |access-date=September 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163130/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/12/05/columbine.diary/ |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHarris entered Columbine High School in 1995 as a freshman. Columbine had just gone through a major renovation. From all accounts, he had many friends and was on the soccer team for his freshman and sophomore year. Harris, during his freshman year, met Tiffany Typher, who was in his German class. Typher later recounted that Harris quickly wooed her. Harris asked her to homecoming and she accepted. After the event, it appeared that Typher was no longer interested in seeing Harris anymore. It is unknown why Typher was reluctant to be with Harris anymore. When Typher refused to socialize with Harris again, Harris staged a fake 'suicide', sprawling on the ground with fake blood splashed all over him. When Typher saw him she began to scream for help, at which point Harris and his friends began laughing, prompting Typher to storm off, shouting at Harris to get psychological help.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190723095423/http://www.acolumbinesite.com/eric.php |archive-date=July 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Dylan Klebold===\n'''Dylan Bennet Klebold''' was born on September 11, 1981 in [[Lakewood, Colorado]] to Thomas and [[Sue Klebold|Susan Klebold]].<ref name=\"Suspects\">{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Suspects Text |publisher=CNN |accessdate=September 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726055023/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=July 26, 2012 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His parents were [[Pacifism|pacifists]] and attended a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church with their children.

He was in Cub Scouts with friend Brooks Brown, whom he was friends with since the first grade. Brown lived near the house Harris' parents had bought when they finally settled in Littleton, and rode the same bus as Harris. Shortly after, Harris introduced Klebold to his friend Nathan Dykeman, who also attended their middle school, and they all became a tight-knit group of friends.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508103216/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2000/columbine.cd/Pages/SUSPECTS_TEXT.htm |archive-date=May 8, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Personalities===\nHarris and Klebold were described, by people that knew them, as almost having opposite personalities. Both boys were known to be highly intelligent, especially with computers. Harris and Klebold were enrolled in a few tech related classes during their tenure at Columbine High School.\n\nHarris was described as very nice and likeable when growing up, who often hugged his female classmates and on one occasion even gave his favorite teacher a Christmas present. Many adults even referred to Harris as [[charisma]]tic. Harris often secretly bragged about his ability to deceive other people, once stating in a tape that he could make anyone believe anything.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 6, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715180540/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/columbine_basement_tapes_1.0.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite people's great remakes on Harris's personality, this didn't last. By his junior year, Harris was also known to be ill-tempered. Many people noticed this odd change in his behavior. Unlike before, Harris would be angry with everyone and seemed that no one was good enough for his standards. This seemed more evident by his journal entries, which included Harris ranting about all kinds of groups of people, based on race, sex, sexual orientation and social status.\n\nMeanwhile, Klebold was described by his peers as painfully shy and quiet. Although some people said he became more outgoing as he got older. Judy Brown, mother of Brooks, said that when her son and Klebold were younger, that Klebold was the shyest child she had ever met. Klebold would often be fidgety whenever someone new talked to him, rarely opening up to people. However, like Harris, Klebold was prone to angry outbursts and was known to have had verbal altercations with his teachers and his boss at [[Blackjack Pizza]]. Unlike Harris, not many people had been worried about Klebold, as many people have stated that Klebold's personality stayed mostly consistent throughout high school.\n\n===Friendship===\nMuch of the information on Harris and Klebold's friendship is unknown, on their interactions and conversations, aside from the Basement Tapes, which only transcripts have been released of. Harris and Klebold met at Ken Caryl Middle School during their seventh grade year. Over time, they became increasingly close, hanging out by often going out bowling, carpooling and playing the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' over a private server they connected their personal computers to. By their junior year in high school, the boys were described as inseparable. Chad Laughlin, a close friend of Harris and Klebold, said that they always sat alone together at lunch and often kept to themselves.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|title=Forgiving my Columbine High School friend, Dylan Klebold|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 17, 2009|website=Westword|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621134956/https://www.westword.com/news/forgiving-my-columbine-high-school-friend-dylan-klebold-5834485|archive-date=June 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> A rumor eventually started that Harris and Klebold were [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and romantically involved, but it is unknown if they were aware of this rumor.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hari |first1=Johann |title=The cult of Eric and Dylan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-cult-of-eric-and-dylan-73697.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=15 January 2004}}</ref> Judy Brown believed Harris was more emotionally dependent on Klebold, who was more liked by the broader student population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|title=Zero Hour - Massacre at Columbine High|first=|last=XxSlenderMotoxX|date=November 9, 2012|publisher=|access-date=June 30, 2019|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190613063423/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4K8YE1ZatU|archive-date=June 13, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Although, seemingly from Klebold's journals, Klebold felt that he wasn't loved or accepted by the general student population.

Page after page was covered in hearts, as he was secretly in love with a Columbine student. Although both had difficulty controlling their anger, Klebold's anger had led to his being more prone to serious trouble than Harris. Klebold was known to swear at teachers and fight with his boss at Blackjack Pizza. After their arrest, which both recorded as the most traumatic thing they had ever experienced, Klebold wrote a letter to Harris, saying how they would have so much fun getting revenge and killing cops, and how his wrath from the January arrest would be \"god-like\". On the day of the massacre, Klebold wore a black T-shirt which had the word \"WRATH\" printed in red.<ref name=USAToday/> It was speculated that revenge for the arrest was a possible motive for the attack, and that the pair planned on having a massive gun battle with police during the shooting. Klebold wrote that life was no fun without a little death, and that he would like to spend the last moments of his life in nerve-wracking twists of murder and bloodshed. He furthermore wrote that what fun is life without death. He concluded by saying that he would kill himself afterward in order to leave the world that he hated and go to a better place.

Harris and Klebold reportedly discussed their motives for the attacks in these videos and gave instructions in bomb making. Police cite the reason for withholding these tapes as an effort to prevent them from becoming \"call-to-arms\" and \"how-to\" videos that could inspire copycat killers.<ref>''Mass and Serial Murder in America'' {{ISBN|978-3-31944280-8}} p. 41</ref> Some people have argued that releasing the tapes would allow psychologists to study them and would help identify characteristics of future killers.\n\n===Media accounts===\nInitially,<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> the shooters were believed to be members of a clique that called themselves the \"Trench Coat Mafia\", a small group of Columbine's self-styled outcasts who wore heavy black [[trench coats]]. Early reports described the members as also wearing German slogans and swastikas on their clothes.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Additional media reports described the Trench Coat Mafia as a cult with ties to the Neo-Nazi movement which fueled a media stigma and bias against the Trench Coat Mafia. The Trench Coat Mafia was a group of friends who hung out together, wore black trench coats, and prided themselves on being different from the 'jocks' who had been bullying the members and who also coined the name Trench Coat Mafia.<ref name=\"No easy answers\">{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1 | title=No easy answers: The truth behind death at Columbine | publisher=Lantern Books | author1=Brown, Brooks | author2=Merritt, Rob | year=2002 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-pC_WzWbOzxls5ms1/page/n67 68]\u201370 | isbn=1590560310 | access-date=September 23, 2016 }}</ref> The trench coat inadvertently became the members' uniform after a mother of one of the members bought it as an inexpensive present.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\nInvestigation revealed that Harris and Klebold were only friends with one member of the group, Kristin Thiebault, and that most of the primary members of the Trench Coat Mafia had left the school by the time that Harris and Klebold committed the massacre.

According to Supervisory Special Agent Dwayne Fuselier, the FBI's lead Columbine investigator and a clinical psychologist, Harris exhibited a pattern of grandiosity, contempt, and lack of empathy or remorse, distinctive traits of psychopaths that Harris concealed through deception. Fuselier adds that Harris engaged in mendacity not merely to protect himself, as Harris rationalized in his journal, but also for pleasure, as seen when Harris expressed his thoughts in his journal regarding how he and Klebold avoided prosecution for breaking into a van. Other leading psychiatrists concur that Harris was a psychopath.<ref name = \"slate\"/>\n\nAccording to psychologist Peter Langman, Klebold displayed signs of [[schizotypal personality disorder]] \u2013 he struck many people as odd, was very shy, appeared to have had disturbed thought processes and constantly misused language in unusual ways as evidenced by his journal, considered notable due to Klebold's peers that often described him as very intelligent. He appeared to have been delusional, viewed himself as \"god-like\" and wrote about he was \"made a human without the possibility of BEING human.\" He was also convinced that others hated him and felt like he was being conspired against, even though according to many reports, Klebold was loved by his family and plenty of friends.<ref>{{Citation | last = Langman | first = Peter | title = Rampage School Shooters: A Typology | orig-year = 2010 | year = 2016 | edition =  | chapter =  | chapter-url =  | page =  | pages =  | language =  | url = https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190712111604/https://schoolshooters.info/sites/default/files/rampage_school_shooters_typology_1.2.pdf | archive-date = July 12, 2019 | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm =  | access-date = July 12, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n===Reaction of Sue Klebold===\n{{see also|A Mother's Reckoning}}\n\n[[Sue Klebold]], mother of Dylan Klebold, initially was in denial about Dylan's involvement in the massacre, believing he was tricked by Eric into doing it, among other things.

Longyear]]'s [[Enemy Mine (novella)|novella of the same name]]. The film stars [[Dennis Quaid]] and [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as a human and alien soldier, respectively, who become stranded together on an inhospitable planet and must overcome their mutual distrust in order to cooperate and survive.\n\nThe film began production in [[Budapest]] in April 1984 under the direction of [[Richard Loncraine]], who quickly ran into \"creative differences\" with producer [[Stephen J. Friedman (producer)|Stephen Friedman]] and executives at [[20th Century Fox]]; the project was shut down after a week of shooting. Petersen then took over as director and reshot Loncraine's scenes after moving the production to [[Munich]].\n\nOriginally budgeted at $17 million, the film ultimately cost more than $40 million after marketing costs were factored in, and was a [[box office bomb]] during the 1985 holiday season, earning only a little over $12 million. However, the film had a big success in the former [[Soviet Union]], where it became the first Western [[sci-fi]] film shown in the theaters. It gained a cult following afterwards.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nIn the late 21st century, an [[Interstellar medium|interstellar]] war between humans (associated as the Bilateral Terran Alliance, or BTA) and [[Dracs]] (bipedal reptilian humanoids) is fought. Battles are periodically fought between fighter spacecraft, and no human hates the Dracs more than Willis E. Davidge ([[Dennis Quaid]]). During one such battle, Davidge and Drac pilot Jeriba Shigan ([[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]) engage in a [[dogfight]] which results in their both crash-landing on Fyrine IV. After initial hostilities where they viciously hunt one another, the two learn to cooperate to survive. Over the next three years they become friends, each saving the other's life several times.\n\nDavidge, haunted by dreams of spaceships landing on the planet, leaves in search of help. He finds evidence of humans, but learns that the planet has only periodically been visited by human miners known as Scavengers who use Dracs as slave labor. He returns to warn Jeriba (nicknamed Jerry) only to hear\u2014sometimes [[Asexual reproduction|it just happens]]\u2014because Dracs have only one gender, and reproduce via [[parthenogenesis]], Jerry is pregnant.\n \nTo pass the time, Davidge and Jerry memorize each other's ancestry, agreeing that Davidge's lineage is \"very thin\". Jerry later dies in childbirth, but not before making Davidge swear to take the child, Zammis ([[Bumper Robinson]]), back to the Drac homeworld and recite ''his'' lineage and join Drac society. Davidge raises Zammis, who calls him \"Uncle\".\n\nOne day a ship flies overhead and Davidge goes to investigate. Zammis is curious and follows. He is discovered by a pair of Scavengers. Davidge attacks the men, but Zammis inadvertently stands between Davidge and one miner, and Davidge is gunned down. Later, a BTA patrol ship finds Davidge apparently dead, and returns him to his base space station.\n\nDuring an impersonal funeral ceremony, Davidge suddenly awakens. He is later reinstated to duty but not as a pilot, as his superiors want to make sure he has not been brainwashed. Unable to get help in rescuing Zammis, Davidge steals a ship to find the child by himself. He manages to find the Scavenger ship and sneak aboard. Davidge speaks to the Drac slaves in their own language; they know about Zammis and realize he is Uncle. Davidge enters the facility, fighting one miner after another, and the slaves revolt. Towards the end of the battle, they are assisted by the BTA crew who pursued the stolen ship.\n\nIn the [[epilogue]], Davidge and Zammis are on the Drac homeworld: \"...{{nbsp}}and when, in the fullness of time, Zammis brought its own child before the Holy Council, the name of 'Willis Davidge' was added to the line of Jeriba.\"\n\n==Cast==\n\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Willis \"Will\" Davidge (called \"Dah-witch\" by Jeriba)\n* [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Jeriba Shigan (called \"Jerry\" by Davidge)\n* [[Brion James]] as Stubbs, the Scavenger leader\n* [[Richard Marcus]] as Arnold, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Carolyn McCormick]] as Morse, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Bumper Robinson]] as Zammis\n* Jim Mapp as Old Drac Slave\n* [[Lance Kerwin]] as Joey Wooster, Davidge's copilot\n* Scott Kraft as Jonathan, a Scavenger\n* Lou Michaels as Wilson, a Scavenger\n* Andy Geer as Bates, a Scavenger\n* Henry Stolow as Cates, Davidge's squadmate\n* [[Herb Andress]] as Hopper, Davidge's superior officer\n* Danmar as Wise Guy\n* Mandy Hausenberger as 1st Medic\n\n==Production==\n\n[[File:Stanley O'Toole, Dennis Quaid, Wolfgang Petersen.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(from left) producer [[Stanley O'Toole]], [[Dennis Quaid]], director [[Wolfgang Petersen]] while filming ''Enemy Mine'' in 1984]]\n\nThe novella was published in 1980 and won a Hugo Award for Best Novella.<ref>Hugo Awards Announced\nThe Washington Post 1 Sep 1980: C6. </ref>\n\n===Richard Loncraine===\n\nThe film began shooting in April 1984 with [[Richard Loncraine]] (''[[Brimstone & Treacle]]'') as director and a budget of $18 million.<ref name=LAT120785>Roderick Mann, [https://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-07/entertainment/ca-14268_1 A Gentleman And A Drac], ''Los Angeles Times'', December 7, 1985, Accessed December 23, 2010.</ref> However, after three weeks of shooting in [[Iceland]] and [[Budapest]], producers became concerned about a mixture of budget overruns, creative differences and poor quality [[dailies]]. \n\n\"It looked like the planet Earth,\" said one executive close to the production. \"It was costing millions of dollars to create a different look and both the location and Lou Gossett's costume made it look like a cheap '50s horror movie.\" <ref name=\"globe\">WOLFGANG PETERSEN; THE CREATOR OF 'DAS BOOT' VENTURES INTO OUTER SPACE: Blowen, Michael.

Meanwhile, Fox arranged for a television \"network roadblock\": virtually simultaneous thirty-second [[prime time]] commercials on [[Television network#History|all three]]. Still that same day, 3,500 [[Trailer (film)|theatrical trailers]] were shipped to theaters across America, and 164 of the nation's biggest shopping malls were covered with posters for the film.<ref name=LAT123085/>\n\nThe campaign received some critical scorn from those in the industry. The poster, with the two leads staring at each other, was singled out for failing to convey the warmth of the story. A marketing head at another studio called it \"one of the worst of the year, really terrible. There was a way to make the movie much more palatable.\"<ref name=LAT123085/>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the original 108m 38s movie was cut down to 93m 5s when first released theatrically, and later on VHS,<ref>[https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/enemy-mine BBFC: ''Enemy Mine''\u2014film]</ref> although the full-length version was reinstated for the 2002 DVD.<ref>[https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/enemy-mine-2002-0 BBFC: ''Enemy Mine''\u2014video]</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\n\n''Enemy Mine'' was met with mixed reviews upon its release, and in 2015 scored 59% positive on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|enemy_mine|Enemy Mine}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film {{frac|2|1|2}} out of 4{{nbsp}}stars, saying it \"made no compromises in its art direction, its special effects and its performances\u2014and then compromised everything else in sight.\"<ref>{{cite news |title= Enemy Mine |author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=1985-12-20 |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851220/REVIEWS/512200303 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to it as \"This season's ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''\", referring to the critically panned science fiction epic from the previous year.<ref name=NYT122085>Janet Maslin, [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&res=980DE6D7153BF933A15751C1A963948260 Screen: Enemy Mine], ''The New York Times'', December 20, 1985, Accessed December 23, 2010.</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine called it \"an anthropomorphic view of life but touching nonetheless\".<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Enemy Mine |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=1984-12-31 |url=https://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790699.html?categoryid=31&cs=1 |accessdate=2010-10-28}}</ref> Seventeen years later, another ''New York Times'' reviewer gave the film a more positive assessment, noting that if it were \"taken in the intended spirit it's often moving, suggesting what might happen if two of earth's perpetually warring peoples were stranded together.\"<ref name=NYT032402>Neil Genzlinger, [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C16F73C5F0C778EDDAA0894DA404482 Movies: Critic's Choice], ''The New York Times'', March 24, 2002, Accessed December 23, 2010.</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film, calling it \"surprisingly coherent, surprisingly enjoyable\".

The German [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] turns the [[Baltic region]] into part of the bloodiest front line of [[World War II]]. Lecter, his younger sister [[Mischa Lecter|Mischa]], and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|re-occupied by the Soviet Union]]. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa. Then, the soldiers kill and eat her. This turns Hannibal into a cannibal.\n\nBy 1949, [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Lithuania is under Soviet rule]] and Lecter Castle has been converted into an orphanage, which also houses Hannibal. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the orphanage to [[Paris]] to live with his widowed aunt, [[Lady Murasaki (Hannibal)|Lady Murasaki]]. While in France, Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Pascal Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, as she leaves the butcher's head on the gates in front of the station during Lecter's interview, Lecter accepts responsibility for the crime.\n\nEventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing [[cadaver]]s. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a [[sodium thiopental]] injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution. His subsequent flashback reveals the men who had killed Mischa had cannibalized her as well. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search of his sister's remains. He excavates the ruins of the lodge where his family died, and upon finding Mischa's remains, he gives her a proper burial. He also unearths the dog-tags of the deserters who killed his sister. One of them, Enrikas Dortlich, sees him arrive in the country and attempts to kill him but is incapacitated by Lecter. After he buries Mischa's remains, Lecter forces Dortlich to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of his gang, then decapitates Dortlich with a horse-drawn pulley. Dortlich's blood splashes on Lecter's face, and he licks it off.\n\nLecter then visits Kolnas's restaurant in [[Fontainebleau]]. He finds his young daughter and notices Mischa's bracelet on her. He gives her Kolnas's dogtag. Dortlich's murder puts the rest of the group on alert and, because of the similarity to the first murder, places Lecter under renewed suspicion from Popil. Grutas, now a [[Human trafficking|sex trafficker]], dispatches a second member of the group, Zigmas Milko, to kill him. Lecter kills Milko instead, drowning him in [[formaldehyde]] inside his laboratory. Popil then tries to dissuade him from hunting the gang. During a confrontation with Lady Murasaki, she begs him not to get revenge. He refuses, claiming that he made a promise to Mischa. He then attacks Grutas in his home but Grutas is rescued by his bodyguards.\n\nGrutas kidnaps Lady Murasaki and calls Lecter, using her as bait. Lecter recognizes the sounds of Kolnas's birds from his restaurant in the background. Lecter goes there and plays on Kolnas's emotions by threatening his children. Kolnas gives up the location of Grutas's boat, but Lecter kills him when Kolnas goes for Lecter's gun. Lecter goes to the houseboat and finds Grutas assaulting Lady Murasaki. In a final confrontation, Grutas claims that Lecter had also consumed his sister in broth fed to him by the soldiers, and he was killing them to keep this fact secret. Enraged by the revelation, Lecter eviscerates Grutas by repeatedly carving his sister's initial into his body. Lady Murasaki, finally disturbed by his behavior, flees from him even after he tells her that he loves her. The houseboat is incinerated, but Lecter, assumed to be dead, emerges from the woods. He then hunts down the last member of the group, Grentz, in [[Melville, Saskatchewan|Melville]], Canada, before leaving for the United States.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Gaspard Ulliel]] as [[Hannibal Lecter]]\n** Aaran Thomas as young Hannibal Lecter\n* [[Gong Li]] as Lady Murasaki\n* [[Dominic West]] as Inspector Pascal Popil\n* [[Rhys Ifans]] as Vladis Grutas\n* Helena-Lia Tachovska as Mischa Lecter\n* [[Kevin McKidd]] as Petras Kolnas\n* [[Richard Brake]] as Enrikas Dortlich\n* [[Stephen Walters]] as Zigmas Milko\n* Ivan Marevich as Bronys Grentz\n* Charles Maquignon as Paul Momund\n* [[Ingeborga Dapk\u016bnait\u0117]] as Mrs. Lecter\n* Beata Ben Ammar as Madam Kolnas\n* [[Pavel Bezdek]] as Dieter\n* [[Goran Kosti\u0107]] as Kazys Porvik\n* [[Robbie Kay]] as Robert Kay, Kolnas's son\n* [[Denis M\u00e9nochet]] as Chief of Police\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\n=== Critical response ===\n''Hannibal Rising'' received generally negative reviews from film critics, though Ulliel's performance as Lecter was generally praised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The film garnered a 16% approval rating from 143 critics\u2014an average rating of 3.9 out of 10\u2014on the review-aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which said, \"''Hannibal Rising'' reduces the horror icon to a collection of dime-store psychological traits.\"<ref>{{rotten-tomatoes|id=hannibal_rising|title=Hannibal Rising}} [[Flixster]]</ref> \n[[Metacritic]] provides a score of 35% based on reviews from 30 critics, which indicates \"generally unfavorable\" reviews.<ref>{{metacritic film|id=hannibal-rising|title=Hannibal Rising}} [[CBS Interactive]]</ref> The film was nominated for, but did not win, two [[Golden Raspberry Awards]].
