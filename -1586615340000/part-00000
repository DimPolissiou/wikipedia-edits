The outbreak is infamous for producing a deadly F5 that tore through the suburbs of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], killing 32 people. The Birmingham tornado was one of only two F5 tornadoes that year. The other hit in [[Lawrence County, Tennessee]], on April 16, as part of the same outbreak as the [[1998 Nashville tornado outbreak|1998 Nashville tornadoes]].

The worst of the destruction occurred across the cities of Oak Grove, [[Rock Creek, Alabama|Rock Creek]], and [[McDonald Chapel, Alabama|McDonald Chapel]]. The second area affected by F5 damage was also devastated by a violent tornado in 1956 that tracked through the same areas hit by this storm. Debris from the tornado was scattered across central Alabama as far north as sections of [[Blount County, Alabama|Blount County]], and extensive deforestation occurred along the majority of the path.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234750/http://www.tornadoproject.com/past/othralts.htm#top#top]</ref> \n\nThe tornado began in rural [[Tuscaloosa County, Alabama|Tuscaloosa County]], only causing F0 damage there. The tornado reached F1 intensity after it entered Jefferson County, and then rapidly intensified to an F3 as it slammed into Oak Grove, an unincorporated town west of Rock Creek. Oak Grove was one of the hardest hit locations, with many structures destroyed in the area. [[Oak Grove High School (Jefferson County, Alabama)|Oak Grove High School]] sustained major structural damage, and the elementary school portion was destroyed.  The school building was rebuilt two years later and reopened a mile away from the damaged area. No one inside the school was killed, but a group of cheerleaders practicing at the school's gymnasium escaped disaster with only minor injuries when a wall prevented a portion of the roof from falling on them. The tornado caused its first three fatalities in Oak Grove, which occurred when a mobile home completely disintegrated, throwing the occupants across the street; only one survived. The Oak Grove fire station was severely damaged as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr116/qr116.html |title=WARNING RESPONSE AND RISK BEHAVIOR IN THE OAK GROVE - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, TORNADO OF 08 APRIL 1998 |last1=Legates |first1=David |year=1999 |website=Colorado.edu |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe tornado continued to intensify dramatically as it moved northeast, reaching F5 intensity as it struck Rock Creek. Many homes in the town were leveled or swept completely away, and the roof of Rock Creek Church of God was blown off. Several cars in the church parking lot were thrown into a 50-foot deep ravine. The church was turned into makeshift [[trauma center]] immediately after the tornado. A total of eleven people were killed in Rock Creek. The far western fringes of [[Concord, Alabama|Concord]] were impacted in this area as well (particularly the Warrior River Road area). The tornado weakened slightly to F4 intensity as it struck the neighboring community of [[Sylvan Springs, Alabama|Sylvan Springs]], where many additional homes were completely leveled, and four people were killed.

This tornado regained its maximum F5 strength as it tore through the communities of [[Edgewater, Alabama|Edgewater]] and McDonald Chapel. Fourteen people lost their lives there and the storm swept away numerous homes. The tornado's effects were noticed around the same time by the ''[[WBMA-LP|ABC 33/40]]'' Birmingham tower [[camera]], which was pointed toward the western suburbs. Even though it was dark, a massive power failure occurred in western Birmingham, when several transmission lines coming from the Miller Steam Plant electric generating station were knocked off line. This was noticed during the long-form weather coverage on ''ABC 33/40'', which lasted most of the evening; <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqvre6mHm9c |title=04/08/1998 ABC 33/40 Oak Grove, Alabama Tornado Coverage |date=October 20, 2014 |website=YouTube |publisher=Allbritton Communications |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref> the station, and several of its competitors, has a policy of pre-empting regular programming and broadcasting only severe weather information when a [[tornado warning]] is in effect for any part of its coverage area. The storm began to weaken somewhat as it crossed State Route 269 into the northern Birmingham neighborhood of Pratt City, though it was still very powerful. F3 damage and several injuries occurred in Pratt City before the tornado abruptly dissipated. Had the tornado remained on the ground, it would have gone into the northern sections of downtown Birmingham. A few miles further to the east, the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham International Airport]] could have been affected as well. The storm lifted before reaching these sections of Birmingham. However, a new F2 tornado touched down again in neighboring [[St. Clair County, Alabama|St. Clair County]], where two people were killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr116/qr116.html |title=WARNING RESPONSE AND RISK BEHAVIOR IN THE OAK GROVE - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, TORNADO OF 08 APRIL 1998 |last1=Legates |first1=David |year=1999 |website=Colorado.edu |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe tornado was at the time the seventh deadliest in [[Alabama]] history, killing one more person than in a tornado that hit Alabama on March 21, 1932; a young boy died nine days after this event from head injuries.

The worst of the destruction occurred across the cities of Oak Grove, [[Rock Creek, Alabama|Rock Creek]], and [[McDonald Chapel, Alabama|McDonald Chapel]]. The second area affected by F5 damage was also devastated by a violent tornado in 1956 that tracked through the same areas hit by this storm. Debris from the tornado was scattered across central Alabama as far north as sections of [[Blount County, Alabama|Blount County]], and extensive deforestation occurred along the majority of the path.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110603234750/http://www.tornadoproject.com/past/othralts.htm#top#top]</ref> \n\nThe tornado began in rural [[Tuscaloosa County, Alabama|Tuscaloosa County]], only causing F0 damage there. The tornado reached F1 intensity after it entered Jefferson County, and then rapidly intensified to an F3 as it slammed into Oak Grove, an unincorporated town west of Rock Creek. Oak Grove was one of the hardest hit locations, with many structures destroyed in the area. [[Oak Grove High School (Jefferson County, Alabama)|Oak Grove High School]] sustained major structural damage, and the elementary school portion was destroyed.  The school building was rebuilt two years later and reopened a mile away from the damaged area. No one inside the school was killed, but a group of cheerleaders practicing at the school's gymnasium escaped disaster with only minor injuries when a wall prevented a portion of the roof from falling on them. The tornado caused its first three fatalities in Oak Grove, which occurred when a mobile home completely disintegrated, throwing the occupants across the street; only one survived. The Oak Grove fire station was severely damaged as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr116/qr116.html |title=WARNING RESPONSE AND RISK BEHAVIOR IN THE OAK GROVE - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, TORNADO OF 08 APRIL 1998 |last1=Legates |first1=David |year=1999 |website=Colorado.edu |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe tornado continued to intensify dramatically as it moved northeast, reaching F5 intensity as it struck Rock Creek. Many homes in the town were leveled or swept completely away, and the roof of Rock Creek Church of God was blown off. Several cars in the church parking lot were thrown into a 50-foot deep ravine. The church was turned into makeshift [[trauma center]] immediately after the tornado. A total of eleven people were killed in Rock Creek. The far western fringes of [[Concord, Alabama|Concord]] were impacted in this area as well (particularly the Warrior River Road area). The tornado weakened slightly to F4 intensity as it struck the neighboring community of [[Sylvan Springs, Alabama|Sylvan Springs]], where many additional homes were completely leveled, and four people were killed.

This tornado regained its maximum F5 strength as it tore through the communities of [[Edgewater, Alabama|Edgewater]] and McDonald Chapel. Fourteen people lost their lives there and the storm swept away numerous homes. The tornado's effects were noticed around the same time by the ''[[WBMA-LP|ABC 33/40]]'' Birmingham tower [[camera]], which was pointed toward the western suburbs. Even though it was dark, a massive power failure occurred in western Birmingham, when several transmission lines coming from the Miller Steam Plant electric generating station were knocked off line. This was noticed during the long-form weather coverage on ''ABC 33/40'', which lasted most of the evening; <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqvre6mHm9c |title=04/08/1998 ABC 33/40 Oak Grove, Alabama Tornado Coverage |date=October 20, 2014 |website=YouTube |publisher=Allbritton Communications |accessdate=April 3, 2017}}</ref> the station, and several of its competitors, has a policy of pre-empting regular programming and broadcasting only severe weather information when a [[tornado warning]] is in effect for any part of its coverage area. The storm began to weaken somewhat as it crossed State Route 269 into the northern Birmingham neighborhood of Pratt City, though it was still very powerful. F3 damage and several injuries occurred in Pratt City before the tornado abruptly dissipated. Had the tornado remained on the ground, it would have gone into the northern sections of downtown Birmingham. A few miles further to the east, the [[Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport|Birmingham International Airport]] could have been affected as well. The storm lifted before reaching these sections of Birmingham. However, a new F2 tornado touched down again in neighboring [[St. Clair County, Alabama|St. Clair County]], where two people were killed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr116/qr116.html |title=WARNING RESPONSE AND RISK BEHAVIOR IN THE OAK GROVE - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, TORNADO OF 08 APRIL 1998 |last1=Legates |first1=David |year=1999 |website=Colorado.edu |publisher=University of Oklahoma |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=event_04081998 |title=April 8, 1998 tornado |date=June 17, 2012 |website=NWS Birmingham |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe tornado was at the time the seventh deadliest in [[Alabama]] history, killing one more person than in a tornado that hit Alabama on March 21, 1932; a young boy died nine days after this event from head injuries.

Its leader, former Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]], ruled out running for reelection to his party's chairmanship, effectively also ruling out any possible attempts to form a governing majority, thus allowing the HDZ to begin talks with the [[Bridge of Independent Lists]] (Most), its junior partner in the outgoing government led by the [[Independent (politician)|non-partisan]] Prime Minister [[Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107]]. Most set out seven conditions for entering into a government with any party and Plenkovi\u0107 began discussions lasting several weeks with Most representatives. Plenkovi\u0107 also held talks with the 8 representatives of national minorities, as HDZ and Most would not have a majority without their support. Over the next few weeks several other parties, including the [[Croatian Peasant Party|HSS]] proceeded to give their support to a government led by Plenkovi\u0107. However, it is widely viewed that HSS chairman [[Kre\u0161o Beljak]] agreed to give Plenkovi\u0107 the support of his 5 party's MPs and \"100 days of peace before turning into the sharpest opposition\" in order to calm tensions resulting from a dispute between him and HSS [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] [[Marijana Petir]], who had called for HSS to enter the center-right government to be formed by HDZ and Most instead of remaining a part of the [[People's Coalition (Croatia)|People's Coalition]] as an opposition party. The dispute escalated and Beljak proceeded to suspend over 100 members of the party, including Petir. Plenkovi\u0107 further received the support of the [[Milan Bandi\u0107 365 - The Party of Labour and Solidarity|Milan Bandi\u0107 365]] party, one out of two [[Croatian Party of Pensioners|HSU]] MPs and one former member of [[Human Blockade]]. He formally received 91 signatures of support from MPs on 10 October 2016, far more than the necessary 76, and presented them to President [[Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107]], who named him Prime Minister-designate and gave him 30 days time until 9 November to form a government.\n\n==Prime Minister (2016\u2013present)==\n{{see also|Cabinet of Andrej Plenkovi\u0107}}\n[[File:Treaty of Rome anniversary group photograph 2017-03-25 02.jpg|350px|thumb|Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 (top row second from right) with rest of the European chief executives during a ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the signing of the [[Treaty of Rome]] in [[Rome]] on 25 March 2017.]]\nAndrej Plenkovi\u0107 was confirmed as the 12th Prime Minister of Croatia along with his cabinet of 20 ministers by a vote of 91 in favor, 45 against and 3 abstentions among 151 Members of Parliament on 19 October 2016.

Namely, Most consider that Mari\u0107 had knowledge of irregularities occurring in the way Agrokor paid its suppliers and had chosen to not reveal that information to protect the firm he formerly worked for. On 28 April 2017 the last remaining government minister from Most, Public Administration minister [[Ivan Kova\u010di\u0107]], resigned his post and Most announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition. HDZ started to gather signatures from Members of Parliament to push through a vote of no confidence in the Speaker of Parliament [[Bo\u017eo Petrov]], who is also the chairman of Most. At the same time, HDZ announced that it would seek to form a new governing majority in Parliament, bypassing Most. With MOST deciding to withdraw its parliamentary support for the Plenkovi\u0107 cabinet, Bo\u017eo Petrov resigned as speaker on 5 May 2017 and was succeeded by [[Gordan Jandrokovi\u0107]] of the HDZ. Now without the support of MOST, the HDZ-dominated cabinet was left without a clear parliamentary majority and the possibility of yet another early parliamentary election, the third in 18 months, taking place was extremely heightened. However, the government crisis was ultimately resolved on 9 June 2017 when 5 out of 9 Members of Parliament representing the [[Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats]] (HNS) agreed to enter a coalition with the HDZ, while the other four MPs (among them [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]] and [[Anka Mrak Tarita\u0161]]) decided to leave HNS and form a new political party called the [[Civic Liberal Alliance]] (Glas).

Its leader, former Prime Minister [[Zoran Milanovi\u0107]], ruled out running for reelection to his party's chairmanship, effectively also ruling out any possible attempts to form a governing majority, thus allowing the HDZ to begin talks with the [[Bridge of Independent Lists]] (Most), its junior partner in the outgoing government led by the [[Independent (politician)|non-partisan]] Prime Minister [[Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107]]. Most set out seven conditions for entering into a government with any party and Plenkovi\u0107 began discussions lasting several weeks with Most representatives. Plenkovi\u0107 also held talks with the 8 representatives of national minorities, as HDZ and Most would not have a majority without their support. Over the next few weeks several other parties, including the [[Croatian Peasant Party|HSS]] proceeded to give their support to a government led by Plenkovi\u0107. However, it is widely viewed that HSS chairman [[Kre\u0161o Beljak]] agreed to give Plenkovi\u0107 the support of his 5 party's MPs and \"100 days of peace before turning into the sharpest opposition\" in order to calm tensions resulting from a dispute between him and HSS [[Member of European Parliament|MEP]] [[Marijana Petir]], who had called for HSS to enter the center-right government to be formed by HDZ and Most instead of remaining a part of the [[People's Coalition (Croatia)|People's Coalition]] as an opposition party. The dispute escalated and Beljak proceeded to suspend over 100 members of the party, including Petir. Plenkovi\u0107 further received the support of the [[Milan Bandi\u0107 365 - The Party of Labour and Solidarity|Milan Bandi\u0107 365]] party, one out of two [[Croatian Party of Pensioners|HSU]] MPs and one former member of [[Human Blockade]].

Namely, Most consider that Mari\u0107 had knowledge of irregularities occurring in the way Agrokor paid its suppliers and had chosen to not reveal that information to protect the firm he formerly worked for. On 28 April 2017 the last remaining government minister from Most, Public Administration minister [[Ivan Kova\u010di\u0107]], resigned his post and Most announced its withdrawal from the ruling coalition. HDZ started to gather signatures from Members of Parliament to push through a vote of no confidence in the Speaker of Parliament [[Bo\u017eo Petrov]], who is also the chairman of Most. At the same time, HDZ announced that it would seek to form a new governing majority in Parliament, bypassing Most. With MOST deciding to withdraw its parliamentary support for the Plenkovi\u0107 cabinet, Bo\u017eo Petrov resigned as speaker on 5 May 2017 and was succeeded by [[Gordan Jandrokovi\u0107]] of the HDZ. Now without the support of MOST, the HDZ-dominated cabinet was left without a clear parliamentary majority and the possibility of yet another early parliamentary election, the third in 18 months, taking place was extremely heightened. However, the government crisis was ultimately resolved on 9 June 2017 when 5 out of 9 Members of Parliament representing the [[Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats]] (HNS) agreed to enter a coalition with the HDZ, while the other four MPs (among them [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]] and [[Anka Mrak Tarita\u0161]]) decided to leave HNS and form a new political party called the [[Civic Liberal Alliance]] (Glas). The Plenkovi\u0107 cabinet underwent a reshuffle, with HNS being given the portfolios of [[Ministry of Science and Education (Croatia)|Science and Education]] and [[Ministry of Construction and Spatial Planning (Croatia)|Construction and Spatial Planning]].\n\nSince May 2017, Plenkovi\u0107 has been constantly named the most negative politician in Croatia by monthly polls conducted by the Promocija plus and IPSOS PULS agencies.<ref>http://www.telegram.hr/politika-kriminal/nakon-godinu-dana-na-vlasti-i-agrokora-plenkovic-je-najnepopularniji-a-vlada-mu-stoji-najgore-dosad/</ref> However, by December 2017, he was also named the third most popular politician, while his party enjoyed considerable rating advantage over all other political parties in Croatia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/cro-demoskop-zivi-zid-postao-treca-stranka-u-hrvatskoj/1012206.aspx|title=CRO DEMOSKOP \u017divi zid postao tre\u0107a stranka u Hrvatskoj|access-date=2017-12-29|language=hr}}</ref>\n\n===Domestic policy===\nFollowing a deal with the HNS, the government introduced an education reform starting with a pilot program in the 2018/2019 school year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://glashrvatske.hrt.hr/en/news/domestic/hdz-and-peoples-party-reach-deal-on-education-reform/|title=HDZ and People's Party reach deal on education reform|publisher=[[Croatian Radio Television]]|date=1 September 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe renewable energy tariff was raised in August 2017 to stimulate the production of renewable energy, which is the source of 28% of the country's energy demand.

He belongs chronologically to the Spanish American [[Baroque]] Colonial period, and shares much with Baroque writers such as Mateo Rosas de Oquendo, [[Sor Juana]] and [[Bernardo de Balbuena]]. He was a social and political critic, pointing out the shortcomings and hypocrisies of the Spanish American colonial administrators.\n\nCaviedes was born in [[Porcuna]], Andalusia, Spain in 1645.  He moved to [[Peru]] at an early age and settled in Lima, later spending some time in the mining area of [[Huancavelica]], where life was hard even for a Spaniard at the top of the social pyramid. As has been shown by various{{which|date=May 2016}} critics, a false biography based on the author's satirical works suggested that he dissipated his fortune on gambling, drink, and women of dubious morals and that as a result of having contracted a venereal disease he directed his satirical bite at the damage done by physicians and their indifferent and rapacious attitude toward their patients.

But behind this criticism is a social and moral attack on the abuses, injustices, and double standards of the Colonial period. He is also the author of serious love and religious poetry.\n\nWhen Caviedes moved to Lima the targets of his satire included not only doctors, but also Lima aristocrats and the Viceregal court. Following satirical tradition, he attacked many professions, among them lawyers, tailors, and street women, with an emphasis on the grotesque, the scatological, the ugly, and the immoral.

The salmon come in with the tidal current which, once the [[tide]] starts to come in, can be extreme. If planning a trip, find tide details and pick days with midday low tides with the largest difference between low and high tide (spring tides, avoid the neap tides). An unofficial \"jungle telegraph\" system operates round the Rosemarkie [[campsite]] and point in June and on into August with details of the latest sightings only a brief conversation away. The [[University of Aberdeen]] operates a more formal range of surveys throughout the year from their field station based just along the coast at [[Cromarty]], supported by funds from the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]. While the Point is regarded by many people as the best place to watch the dolphins from land, licensed boat trips do run from Cromarty, [[Avoch]] and [[Inverness]]. The nearby Dolphin and Seal Centre at [[North Kessock]] also offers good dolphin watching opportunities during the summer months.\n\n===Photographing dolphins===\nMidsummer offers the best light for photography of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s at the point, from late afternoon onwards. While early morning light is good, the direction of the point risks looking directly into the sun. The point has been featured in recent years on a wide range of television programmes, including the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Coast (TV series)|Coast]]'' series and nature programmes. These have greatly increased visitor numbers to the point. The [[wildlife]] requires no special equipment, but those looking for serious photography should pack a fast 200&nbsp;mm to 300&nbsp;mm lens.\n\n==Getting there==\nDriving to the point, while possible, should be avoided on peak days, as parking space is limited. A path runs along the [[Rosemarkie]] side where more space is available. Allow 20 minutes walking time. The path arrives at the point. If you do drive through, you can walk round to the point following the path between two cottages, or along the beach from the small pier at the end of the road. The lighthouse grounds are private and the walls dangerous. There are no toilets at the point - the nearest are at Rosemarkie, either at the car park beside the Plough Inn or at Rosemarkie Beach Cafe. The point is exposed and offers little shelter even in summer.  Parking and walking from Rosemarkie or Fortrose is strongly recommended.\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Scotland|Engineering}}}}\n* [[List of lighthouses in Scotland]]\n* [[List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses]]\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Chanonry Point2006-11.jpg|Chanonry Point\nFile:Chanonry Point2005-05.jpg|Adult female bottlenose and two young\nFile:Chanonry Point2006-07.jpg|Summer time At Chanonry Point\nFile:Chanonry Point2006-08.jpg|Dolphin close to Chanonry Point\nFile:Chanonry Point.jpg|Dolphins jumping as seen from Chanonry Point\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chanonry Point}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070407091242/http://www.cowphotos.com/dolphins.html Finding Dolphins in Scotland]\n*[http://www.stylendesign.co.uk/dolphin/start.html Dolphin Pictures and a Movie at Chanonry Point]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070405113343/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/zoology/lighthouse/ Aberdeen University Lighthouse field station]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070929141938/http://www.dolphinpix.com/dolphins/gallery/dolphins Dolphin Gallery]\n*[http://www.charliephillipsimages.co.uk Photographs and information by Charlie Phillips.]\n*[http://www.wdcs.org Whale & Dolphin Conservation Society]\n* [http://www.nlb.org.uk/LighthouseLibrary/Main/ Northern Lighthouse Board]\n\n{{Lighthouses of the Northern Lighthouse Board}}\n{{coord|57|34|27.144|N|4|5|36.657|W|region:GB_type:city|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Peninsulas of Scotland]]\n[[Category:Fortrose]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox lighthouse\n| name = Chanonry Lighthouse<br>''Cananaich''\n| image_name = Chanonry Lighthouse Fortrose and Rosemarkie - Black Isle, Ross and Cromarty, Scotland (4622320141).jpg\n| image_width = \n| caption = Chanonry Lighthouse\n| location = Chanonry Point<br>[[Fortrose]]<br>[[Highland]]<br>[[Scotland]]<br>[[United Kingdom]]\n| pushpin_map = Scotland\n| relief = 1\n| pushpin_map_caption = Scotland\n| pushpin = lighthouse\n| coordinates = {{coord|57.573979|-4.092692}}\n| coordinates_footnotes =\n| yearbuilt = 1846\n| yearlit  = \n| automated = 1984\n| yeardeactivated = \n| foundation = \n| construction = masonry tower\n| shape = cylindrical tower with balcony and lantern\n| marking = white tower, black lantern, ochre trim\n| height = {{convert|13|m|abbr=on}}\n| focalheight = {{convert|12|m|abbr=on}}\n| lens = \n| currentlens =\n| lightsource = mains power\n| intensity = \n| range = {{convert|15|nmi|lk=in}}\n| characteristic = Oc W 6s.\n| fogsignal = \n| racon = \n| admiralty = A3440\n| canada = \n| NGA = 2900\n| ARLHS = \n| USCG = \n| country = \n| countrynumber = \n| countrylink =\n| managingagent = Northern Lighthouse Board<ref>[https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/lighthouse/sctnw.htm Chanonry (Cananaich)] The Lighthouse Directory.

He was the fourth son of Samuel Heathcote and Catherine Pickering. \n\nOn 14 July 1844, in St. John's, Newfoundland, Edmund married his first wife, Elizabeth Lucy Law with whom he had two sons. In 1850, Lucy bore a third child, whose father was not Edmund; the couple were divorced on 9 March 1851, and Lucy appears to have taken their elder son, William (1845-1884), as well as her young child, to Australia, where her child's father had been transported for seven years penal servitude; William and Lucy both died in Australia.\n\nOn 19 August 1852, Edmund married Jessie Hill, at St. Paul's Cathedral in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]].

Two [[species]] are included in the genus ''Iguana'': the [[green iguana]], which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, and the [[Lesser Antillean iguana]], which is native to the [[Lesser Antilles]] and endangered due to [[habitat destruction]], introduced [[feral]] predators, hunting, and hybridization with introduced green iguanas.\n\nThe word \"iguana\" is derived from the original [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]] name for the species, ''iwana''.<ref name=\"Coles\"/>\nIn addition to the two species in the genus ''Iguana'', several other related genera in the same family have common names of the species including the word \"iguana\".\n\n\n[[File:Iguana marina (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), isla Santa Cruz, islas Gal\u00e1pagos, Ecuador, 2015-07-26, DD 46.JPG | thumb | 220x124px | right]]\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nIguanas can range from {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|order=flip}} in length, including their tail. The two species of [[lizard]] within the genus ''Iguana'' possess a [[dewlap]] and a row of elongated scales running from the midline of their [[neck]]s down to their [[tail]]s. Iguanas have varying types of scales covering different areas of their body, for example, there are some large round [[Reptile scale|tuberculate scales]] scattered around the lateral region of the neck among smaller, overlapping scales.<ref name=\":5\"/> The scales on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] trunk of their body are also thicker and more tightly packed than those on the [[ventral]] side.<ref name=\":5\" /> These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a sub-tympanic shield.<ref name=\"Lazell\"/>\n\nIguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nThe [[Tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]], the iguana's [[eardrum]], is located above the sub-tympanic shield (or \"ear shield\") behind each eye. Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings and their coloration enables them to hide from larger predators.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nLike most [[reptile]]s, an iguana has a three-chambered [[heart]] with two atria, one ventricle, and two aortae with a [[systemic circulation]].<ref name=dabvp2561/>\nThe muscles of an iguana are very light in color, this is due to the high proportion of [[Fast twitch muscle|fast glycolytic muscle fibers]]. These fibers are not very vascularized and are low in [[myoglobin]], giving them their pale look. This high density of fast glycolytic muscle fibers allows iguanas to move very quickly for a short period of time, which facilitates short bursts of movement but is inefficient for long duration movement, since cellular respiration in fast glycolytic muscle fibers is [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]]. \n\n=== Parietal eye ===\nSeveral species of lizard, including the iguana, have a pale scale towards the back of their head marking the [[parietal eye]]. This organ is sensitive to changes in illumination and sends signals to the [[pineal gland]] signaling the change between day and night. A photopigment commonly found in the [[lamprey]], known as parapinopsin, is also found in the iguana and is photosensitive to UV light and aids in the signaling between day and night.<ref name=wada4265/>\n\n=== Skull morphology and diet ===\n[[File:Iguana iguana eating Mangifera indica from Venezuela.jpg|thumb|278x278px|Iguanas have an exclusively herbivorous diet,<ref name=\":1\"/> as illustrated above by a [[green iguana]] eating a [[mango]] in [[Venezuela]]]]\nIguanas have developed a [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] lifestyle, foraging exclusively on vegetation and foliage.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to acquire, process and digest plant matter, herbivorous lizards must have a higher bite force relative to their size in comparison to [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] reptiles. The skull of the iguana has undergone modifications resulting in a strong bite force and efficient processing of [[vegetation]], according to one study.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn order to accomplish this [[Biomechanics|biomechanically]], herbivorous lizards (such as the iguana) have taller and wider skulls, shorter snouts, and larger bodies relative to carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles.<ref name=\":0\" />  Increasing the robusticity of the skull allows for increased muscle presence and increases the ability of the skull to withstand stronger forces.<ref name=herrel2461/>\n[[File:Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana) and teeth.png|alt=Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana).jpg: Brian Gratwicke derivative work: B kimmel (talk)|thumb|276x276px|[[Green iguana]] skull and teeth. The teeth of the [[green iguana]] sit on the surface of the jawbone, known as [[acrodont]]al placement.<ref name=\":2\"/> ]]\nFurthermore, the teeth of the iguana are [[acrodont]]al, meaning that their teeth sit on top of the surface of the jaw bone<ref name=\":2\" /> and project upwards. The teeth themselves are small and serrated - designed to grasp and shear food.<ref name=banzato2631/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMale iguanas, like other male examples of [[Squamata]], have two [[Hemipenis|hemipenes]]. During copulation one hemipene will be inserted into the female's [[Cloaca|cloacal vent]]. Females can store sperm from previous mates for several years to continue to fertilize her eggs in case she finds no male within her territory when she is ready to lay again.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Mating/courtship ===\nIguanas tend to follow a promiscuous or [[Polygynandry|polygynadrous]] mating style during the dry season. Mating during the dry season ensures that their offspring will hatch during the wet or rainy season when food will be more plentiful. Females control large territories where they make several nests. Males compete amongst each other for the females in an area and mark their won territory with a [[pheromone]] secreted from the [[femoral pore]]s on the dorsal side of their hind limbs. Male behavior during sexual competition involves head bobbing, extending and retracting their [[dewlap]], nuzzling and biting the necks of females, and on occasion, changing color. Once a female chooses a male, he will straddle the female and hold her in place by biting onto her shoulder, which sometimes leaves scars on females. After copulation, eggs are laid within several nests and allowed to incubate. This low level of parental intervention with their offspring makes iguanas an example of [[R/K selection theory|r-strategy]] reproduction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Phylogeny==\nA [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] based on nuclear [[Human genome|protein-coding genes]], reviewed by Vidal and Hedges (2009) suggested that the [[subclade]] [[Iguanomorpha|Iguania]] is in a group with [[snake]]s and [[Anguimorpha|anguimorphs]] (lizards). These groups share an oral gland capable of secreting toxins (a derived trait).<ref name=\":3\"/> On the other hand, the phylogeny based on whole [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genomes]], proposed by Rest et al. (2003), places the [[green iguana]] as the closest relative of the [[Plestiodon egregius|mole skink]] (''Plestiodon egregius'').<ref name=molecular1326/> [[Lepidosauria|Lepidosaurs]] are reptiles with overlapping scales, and within this group both iguanians and [[tuatara]]s (''Sphenodon''s) project their tongue to seize prey items instead of using their jaw, which is called tongue [[Prehensility|prehension]]. However, iguanians are the only lineage within [[Squamata]] that displays this trait, meaning that it was gained independently in both iguanians and tuataras.<ref name=\":3\" /> Iguanians are also the only squamates that primarily use their sight to identify and track prey rather than chemoreception or scent, and employ an [[Ambush predator|ambush technique]] of catching prey instead of active searching.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Traditional Reptilia.tif|thumb|246x246px|Simple phylogeny with [[Reptile|Reptilia]] highlighted in green.

However, iguanians are the only lineage within [[Squamata]] that displays this trait, meaning that it was gained independently in both iguanians and tuataras.<ref name=\":3\" /> Iguanians are also the only squamates that primarily use their sight to identify and track prey rather than chemoreception or scent, and employ an [[Ambush predator|ambush technique]] of catching prey instead of active searching.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Traditional Reptilia.tif|thumb|246x246px|Simple phylogeny with [[Reptile|Reptilia]] highlighted in green.
