Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira\u2013Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India.

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages.

Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the Soviets became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

America had suspended aid to India in 1965 at the time of the Indo-Pak war. However, the visit helped India secure more food and development aid from the US. Johnson promised three million tons of food and nine million in aid. Indira resented the US policy of food aid as a tool in forcing India to adopt policies favored by the US. She also resolutely refused to sign the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|NPT]] (Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons).\n\nRelations with US strained badly under President [[Richard Nixon]] when India signed the [[Indo-Bangla Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace |treaty of peace]], Friendship and Co-operation with Russia in 1971.

And, as a woman, Gandhi naturally helped head the Women's section of the Congress Party. She often tried to organize women to involve themselves in politics.<ref>https://theprint.in/politics/indian-women-a-step-closer-to-breaking-glass-ceiling-in-politics/212444/</ref><ref>https://theprint.in/politics/indian-women-a-step-closer-to-breaking-glass-ceiling-in-politics/212444/</ref> Although rhetorically Gandhi may have attempted to separate her political success from her gender, Gandhi did involve herself in women's organizations. The political parties in India paid substantial attention to Gandhi's gender before she became prime minister, hoping to use her for political gain.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/23/archives/indira-gandhi-has-never-regretted-being-a-woman-well-almost-never.html</ref><ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/14/archives/indira-gandhi-is-either-hated-or-adored-indira-gandhi-is-either.html</ref> \nEven though men surrounded Gandhi during her upbringing, she still had a female role model as a child. Several books on Gandhi mention her interest in [[Joan of Arc]]. In her own accounts through her letters, she wrote to her friend Dorothy Norman, in 1952 she wrote: \"At about eight or nine I was taken to France; Jeanne d'Arc became a great heroine of mine. She was one of the first people I read about with enthusiasm.\"<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985.

Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 107.</ref> Gandhi's linking of herself to Joan of Arc presents a nice model for historians to assess Gandhi.

Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 131.</ref>\n\nGandhi had been swept up in the call for Indian independence since she was born in 1917.<ref>\"Indira Gandhi.\" About Indira Gandhi. Web. 20 November 2012.\n<http://www.indiragandhi.com/aboutindiragandhi.htm>.</ref> Thus by 1947, she was already well immersed in politics, and by 1966, when she first assumed the position of prime minister, she had held several cabinet positions in her father's office.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}\n\nGandhi's advocacy for women's rights began with her help in establishing the Congress Party's Women's Section.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}} In 1956, she wrote in a letter: \"It is because of this that I am taking a much more active part in politics. I have to do a great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Gandhi spent a great deal of time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: \"The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field.\"<ref>Norman, Dorothy. Indira Gandhi, Letters to an American Friend. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1985. Print. 57.</ref> Once appointed president in 1959, she \"travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region\"<ref>Jayakar, Pupul.

Print. 112.</ref> Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=August 2017}}. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that \"Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once.\"<ref name=\"Norman, Dorothy 1985\"/>\n\nGandhi felt guilty about her inability to fully devote her time to her children. She noted that her main problem in office was how to balance her political duties with tending to her children, and \"stressed that motherhood was the most important part of her life.\"<ref>Genovese, Michael A., ed. Women As National Leaders. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications, 1993. Print. 127.</ref> At another point, she went into more detail: \"To a woman, motherhood is the highest fulfilment...To bring a new being into this world, to see its perfection and to dream of its future greatness is the most moving of all experiences and fills one with wonder and exaltation.\"<ref>Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi: A Personal and Political Biography. Boston: Northeastern UP, 1989. Print. 55.</ref>\n\nHer domestic initiatives did not necessarily reflect favourably on Indian women. Gandhi did not make a special effort to appoint women to cabinet positions. She did not appoint any women to full cabinet rank during her terms in office.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/> Yet despite this, many women saw Gandhi as a symbol for feminism and an image of women's power.<ref name=\"Genovese, Michael A. 1993\"/>\n\n==Legacy== \n\nAfter leading India to victory against Pakistan in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] in 1971, President [[V.

She lives in the residence of King Narai's chief astrologer, who holds the noble title of [[Phra Horathibodi|Chaophraya Horathibodi]] (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35) and is the father of her fianc\u00e9, [[Khun Si Wisan Wacha|Det]] (\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a), a foreign ministry official holding the noble title of Muen Sunthon Thewa (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e32).\n\nOne day, Karaket orders her attendants, Phin (\u0e1c\u0e34\u0e19) and Yaem (\u0e41\u0e22\u0e49\u0e21), to capsize the boat of her love rival, Lady Chanwat (\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e32\u0e14), a daughter of [[Kosa Lek|Lek]] (\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01), the foreign minister holding the noble title of Chaophraya Kosathibodi (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e42\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35). Chanwat survives, but a maidservant of her dies in the incident. As everyone suspects Karaket, Chaophraya Horathibodi recites the [[Krishna|Kritsana]]-[[Kali]] mantra (\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e13\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25\u0e35) to find out if she really is the culprit. The mantra kills Karaket, and her soul travels forwards to the present time to meet Ketsurang (\u0e40\u0e01\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c), a 25-year-old woman who appears to be her twin sister and has just died in a car accident. Karaket asks Ketsurang to assume her body and do good deeds to turn over a new leaf.\n\nAs Ketsurang wakes up in Karaket's body, she finds that all the people around her hate her because of Ketsurang's evil acts in the past. In Ayutthaya, she befriends many historical figures, including [[Kosa Pan|Pan]] (\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e19), Lek's younger brother who holds the noble title of Phra Wisut Sunthon (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23), and [[Maria Guyomar de Pinha]], a Japanese\u2013Portuguese woman whom [[Constantine Phaulkon]], a Greek adventurer and King Narai's minister, falls in love with. She also finds that Rueang (\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07), Det's comrade who holds the noble title of Muen Rueang Ratchaphakdi (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e20\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35), looks so much like Rueangrit (\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c), her boyfriend in the present day, thus feeling closely acquainted with him.\n\nThe eccentric and goofy behaviour of a modern-day woman like Ketsurang shocks everyone, but her kindness makes them change their attitude towards her, winning their hearts and minds eventually. As for Det, despite suspecting her strangely changed behaviour and believing that a ghost is possessing her, he finds himself deep in love with her, whilst Ketsurang herself also finds that she has developed romantic feelings for him, much to the dismay of Karaket's ghost. To appease Karaket, Ketsurang refuses to marry Det. But Karaket later changes her mind and blesses their marriage as the good deeds Ketsurang has performed allows Karaket to leave the afterlife for a [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].\n\nMeanwhile, Rueang is promoted to the title of Khun Rueang Aphai Phakdi (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e20\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35) and tries to win the heart of Lady Chanwat, whose father, Lek, has been charged with corruption and punished to death according to complaints from Phaulkon. Rueang manages to gain favour from Chanwat's mother, Lady Nim (\u0e19\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21), who disdains his low race, and later gets promoted to Phra Ram Narong (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21\u0e13\u0e23\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c).\n\nDet also gets promoted to a higher rank, obtaining the title of Khun Si Wisan Wacha (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e27\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32), and is appointed to an [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Ayutthayan embassy]] accredited to the court of King [[Louis XIV]] of France, with Pan as ambassador. After returning to Ayutthaya from France, he gets promoted to Phra Si Wisan Sunthon (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23). Det, Rueang, and Pan later join the [[Siamese revolution of 1688|successful enterprise]] of [[Phetracha|Phra Phet Racha]], King Narai's xenophobic regent, to seize power and get rid of the Christians in the kingdom. The coup is supported by the Buddhist clergy and Narai's own daughter, Princess [[Sudawadi]], and leads to the execution of Phaulkon.\n\nKetsurang later discovers a [[Samut khoi|folding book]] containing the Kritsana-Kali mantra. As she touches it, her soul flies out of Karaket's body and returns to the present, where she finds that her boyfriend, Rueangrit, has blamed himself for her death during the car accident and has decided to enter the monkhood for life in dedication to her. Ketsurang then sees the shadow of Det in the body of Rueangrit and learns that Rueangrit is actually a rebirth of Det who has been reborn to marry her for many lives, thus realising that they are destined to be together. Suddenly, she hears the Kritsana-Kali mantra, which everyone at the residence of Chaophraya Horathibodi has been chanting for days in order to help her return to the body. As she wakes up again, Det hugs her tight, telling her that he loves her no matter who she is or where she was from.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main ===\n* [[Ranee Campen]] as Ketsurang/Karaket\n*[https://vi.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanawat_Wattanaputi Thanawat Wattanaputi] as [[Khun Si Wisan Wacha|Det]], son of Chaophraya Horathibodi and Champa\n* [[Louis Scott (actor)|Louis Scott]] as [[Constantine Phaulkon|Constantine Phaulkon]]\n* [[Susira Nanna]] as [[Maria Guyomar de Pinha]], Phaulkon's wife\n* [[Parama Imanothai]] as Rueang/Rueangrit\n* [[Kannarun Wongkajornklai]] as Lady Chanwat, daughter of Lek and Nim\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Praptpadol Suwanbang]] as King [[Narai]]\n* [[Sarut Vijittranon]] as [[Phetracha|Phra Phet Racha]], Narai's regent\n* [[Jirayu Tantrakul]] as [[Suriyenthrathibodi|Luang Sorasak]], Phra Phet Racha's son\n* [[Nirut Sirijanya]] as [[Phra Horathibodi|Chaophraya Horathibodi]], Narai's chief astrologer\n* [[Chamaiporn Jaturaput]] as Lady Champa, Chaophraya Horathibodi's wife\n* [[Surasak Chaiat]] as Lek, Narai's foreign minister\n* [[Chartchai Ngamsan]] as [[Kosa Pan|Pan]], Lek's younger brother\n* [[Rachanee Siralert]] as Lady Nim, Lek's wife\n* [[Ampha Phoosit]] as Prik, Champa's attendant\n* [[Vimon Panchalijunha]] as Chuan, Champa's attendant\n* [[Janya Thanasawaangkoun]] as Phin, Karaket's attendant\n* [[Ramida Prapatsanobon]] as Yaem, Karaket's attendant\n* [[Witsarut Himmarat]] as Choi, Det's attendant\n\n===Cameos===\n* [[Paweena Chariffsakul]] as Ketsurang's mother\n* [[Banjerdsri Yamabhaya]] as Ketsurang's grandmother\n* [[Tachaya Prathumwan]] as [[Phra Pi]], Narai's adopted son\n* [[Natanop Chuenhirun]] as [[Si Prat]], Det's older brother\n* [[Thongkao Pattarachokechai]] as Maria's father\n* [[Suzana Renaud]] as Clara, Maria's attendant\n* [[Wariya Thaisaet]] as Claudia, Maria's attendant\n* [[Watcharachai Sunthornsiri]] as Achan Chi Pa Khao (White-Robed Master)\n* [[Wiksawaweet Wongwannlop]] as Luang Si Yot, Narai's minister\n* [[Peter Tuinstra]] as [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Rating ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

She lives in the residence of King Narai's chief astrologer, who holds the noble title of [[Phra Horathibodi|Chaophraya Horathibodi]] (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e42\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35) and is the father of her fianc\u00e9, [[Khun Si Wisan Wacha|Det]] (\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a), a foreign ministry official holding the noble title of Muen Sunthon Thewa (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e40\u0e17\u0e27\u0e32).\n\nOne day, Karaket orders her attendants, Phin (\u0e1c\u0e34\u0e19) and Yaem (\u0e41\u0e22\u0e49\u0e21), to capsize the boat of her love rival, Lady Chanwat (\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e32\u0e14), a daughter of [[Kosa Lek|Lek]] (\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e47\u0e01), the foreign minister holding the noble title of Chaophraya Kosathibodi (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e42\u0e01\u0e29\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e35). Chanwat survives, but a maidservant of her dies in the incident. As everyone suspects Karaket, Chaophraya Horathibodi recites the [[Krishna|Kritsana]]-[[Kali]] mantra (\u0e21\u0e19\u0e15\u0e23\u0e4c\u0e01\u0e24\u0e29\u0e13\u0e01\u0e32\u0e25\u0e35) to find out if she really is the culprit. The mantra kills Karaket, and her soul travels forwards to the present time to meet Ketsurang (\u0e40\u0e01\u0e28\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c), a 25-year-old woman who appears to be her twin sister and has just died in a car accident. Karaket asks Ketsurang to assume her body and do good deeds to turn over a new leaf.\n\nAs Ketsurang wakes up in Karaket's body, she finds that all the people around her hate her because of Ketsurang's evil acts in the past. In Ayutthaya, she befriends many historical figures, including [[Kosa Pan|Pan]] (\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e19), Lek's younger brother who holds the noble title of Phra Wisut Sunthon (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e17\u0e18\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23), and [[Maria Guyomar de Pinha]], a Japanese\u2013Portuguese woman whom [[Constantine Phaulkon]], a Greek adventurer and King Narai's minister, falls in love with. She also finds that Rueang (\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07), Det's comrade who holds the noble title of Muen Rueang Ratchaphakdi (\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e37\u0e48\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e20\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35), looks so much like Rueangrit (\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e24\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c), her boyfriend in the present day, thus feeling closely acquainted with him.\n\nThe eccentric and goofy behaviour of a modern-day woman like Ketsurang shocks everyone, but her kindness makes them change their attitude towards her, winning their hearts and minds eventually. As for Det, despite suspecting her strangely changed behaviour and believing that a ghost is possessing her, he finds himself deep in love with her, whilst Ketsurang herself also finds that she has developed romantic feelings for him, much to the dismay of Karaket's ghost. To appease Karaket, Ketsurang refuses to marry Det. But Karaket later changes her mind and blesses their marriage as the good deeds Ketsurang has performed allows Karaket to leave the afterlife for a [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].\n\nMeanwhile, Rueang is promoted to the title of Khun Rueang Aphai Phakdi (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e20\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e35) and tries to win the heart of Lady Chanwat, whose father, Lek, has been charged with corruption and punished to death according to complaints from Phaulkon. Rueang manages to gain favour from Chanwat's mother, Lady Nim (\u0e19\u0e34\u0e48\u0e21), who disdains his low race, and later gets promoted to Phra Ram Narong (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21\u0e13\u0e23\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c).\n\nDet also gets promoted to a higher rank, obtaining the title of Khun Si Wisan Wacha (\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e27\u0e32\u0e08\u0e32), and is appointed to an [[Siamese embassy to France (1686)|Ayutthayan embassy]] accredited to the court of King [[Louis XIV]] of France, with Pan as ambassador. After returning to Ayutthaya from France, he gets promoted to Phra Si Wisan Sunthon (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e27\u0e34\u0e28\u0e32\u0e25\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23). Det, Rueang, and Pan later join the [[Siamese revolution of 1688|successful enterprise]] of [[Phetracha|Phra Phet Racha]], King Narai's xenophobic regent, to seize power and get rid of the Christians in the kingdom. The coup is supported by the Buddhist clergy and Narai's own daughter, Princess [[Sudawadi]], and leads to the execution of Phaulkon.\n\nKetsurang later discovers a [[Samut khoi|folding book]] containing the Kritsana-Kali mantra. As she touches it, her soul flies out of Karaket's body and returns to the present, where she finds that her boyfriend, Rueangrit, has blamed himself for her death during the car accident and has decided to enter the monkhood for life in dedication to her. Ketsurang then sees the shadow of Det in the body of Rueangrit and learns that Rueangrit is actually a rebirth of Det who has been reborn to marry her for many lives, thus realising that they are destined to be together. Suddenly, she hears the Kritsana-Kali mantra, which everyone at the residence of Chaophraya Horathibodi has been chanting for days in order to help her return to the body. As she wakes up again, Det hugs her tight, telling her that he loves her no matter who she is or where she was from.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main ===\n* [[Ranee Campen]] as Ketsurang/Karaket\n* [[Thanavat Wattanaputi]] as [[Khun Si Wisan Wacha|Det]], son of Chaophraya Horathibodi and Champa\n* [[Louis Scott (actor)|Louis Scott]] as [[Constantine Phaulkon|Constantine Phaulkon]]\n* [[Susira Nanna]] as [[Maria Guyomar de Pinha]], Phaulkon's wife\n* [[Parama Imanothai]] as Rueang/Rueangrit\n* [[Kannarun Wongkajornklai]] as Lady Chanwat, daughter of Lek and Nim\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Praptpadol Suwanbang]] as King [[Narai]]\n* [[Sarut Vijittranon]] as [[Phetracha|Phra Phet Racha]], Narai's regent\n* [[Jirayu Tantrakul]] as [[Suriyenthrathibodi|Luang Sorasak]], Phra Phet Racha's son\n* [[Nirut Sirijanya]] as [[Phra Horathibodi|Chaophraya Horathibodi]], Narai's chief astrologer\n* [[Chamaiporn Jaturaput]] as Lady Champa, Chaophraya Horathibodi's wife\n* [[Surasak Chaiat]] as Lek, Narai's foreign minister\n* [[Chartchai Ngamsan]] as [[Kosa Pan|Pan]], Lek's younger brother\n* [[Rachanee Siralert]] as Lady Nim, Lek's wife\n* [[Ampha Phoosit]] as Prik, Champa's attendant\n* [[Vimon Panchalijunha]] as Chuan, Champa's attendant\n* [[Janya Thanasawaangkoun]] as Phin, Karaket's attendant\n* [[Ramida Prapatsanobon]] as Yaem, Karaket's attendant\n* [[Witsarut Himmarat]] as Choi, Det's attendant\n\n===Cameos===\n* [[Paweena Chariffsakul]] as Ketsurang's mother\n* [[Banjerdsri Yamabhaya]] as Ketsurang's grandmother\n* [[Tachaya Prathumwan]] as [[Phra Pi]], Narai's adopted son\n* [[Natanop Chuenhirun]] as [[Si Prat]], Det's older brother\n* [[Thongkao Pattarachokechai]] as Maria's father\n* [[Suzana Renaud]] as Clara, Maria's attendant\n* [[Wariya Thaisaet]] as Claudia, Maria's attendant\n* [[Watcharachai Sunthornsiri]] as Achan Chi Pa Khao (White-Robed Master)\n* [[Wiksawaweet Wongwannlop]] as Luang Si Yot, Narai's minister\n* [[Peter Tuinstra]] as [[Simon de la Loub\u00e8re]]\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Rating ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Episode \n! scope=\"col\" | Bangkok\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationwide\n! scope=\"col\" | Urban\n! scope=\"col\" | Rural\n|-\n|21-02-2018\t||1\t||5.80\t||3.40\t||4.60\t||2.40\n|-\n|22-02-2018\t||2\t||7.50\t||4.80\t||5.70\t||3.80\n|-\n|28-02-2018\t||3\t||11.60\t||7.30\t||9.30\t||5.60\n|-\n|01-03-2018\t||4\t||13.00\t||8.20\t||10.00\t||6.40\n|-\n|07-03-2018\t||5\t||16.00\t||11.40\t||13.00\t||9.70\n|-\n|08-03-2018\t||6\t||19.80\t||12.60\t||14.30\t||10.40\n|-\n|14-03-2018\t||7\t||20.50\t||14.80\t||17.80\t||12.30\n|-\n|15-03-2018\t||8\t||22.80\t||15.50\t||18.50\t||12.70\n|-\n|21-03-2018\t||9\t||23.40\t||16.00\t||19.60\t||13.00\n|-\n|22-03-2018\t||10\t||21.40\t||16.00\t||20.20\t||13.20\n|-\n|28-03-2018\t||11\t||22.60\t||17.40\t||20.60\t||15.10\n|-\n|29-03-2018\t||12\t||23.90\t||17.40\t||19.80\t||15.00\n|-\n|04-04-2018\t||13\t||21.80\t||17.40\t||21.80\t||14.80\n|-\n|05-04-2018\t||14\t||23.90\t||17.90\t||20.90\t||15.40\n|-\n|11-04-2018\t||15\t||23.40\t||18.60\t||22.80\t||16.10\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" | Average:\t||18.50\t||13.30\t||15.90\t||11.10\n|}\n\n====Specials====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Episode \n! scope=\"col\" | Bangkok\n! scope=\"col\" | Nationwide\n! scope=\"col\" | Urban\n! scope=\"col\" | Rural\n|-\n|12-04-2018\t||Sp.1\t||12.60\t||10.10\t||12.40\t||8.60\n|-\n|18-04-2018\t||Sp.2\t||12.30\t||8.60\t||11.50\t||6.70\n|-\n|19-04-2018\t||Sp.3\t||12.50\t||8.00\t||10.60\t||6.30\n|-\n|colspan=\"2\" | Average:\t||12.50\t||9.10\t||11.50\t||7.20\n|}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\n* \"Bupphesanniwat\" (\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e19\u0e34\u0e27\u0e32\u0e2a), opening theme by [[Saranyu Winaipanit]]\n* \"Phiang Sop Ta\" (\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e35\u0e22\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e1a\u0e15\u0e32; Just Eye Contact), ending theme by [[Lydia Sarunrat|Sarunrat Dean]]\n* \"Ochao Oei\" (\u0e2d\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e22; \"Thou Oh Thou\") by [[Pete Pol]]\n** Special version by Thanavat Vatthanaputi\n* \"Thoe No Thoe\" (\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e40\u0e18\u0e2d; \"You Oh You\") by Wathiya Ruangnirat\n** Special version by Ranee Campen\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.ch3thailand.com/\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e073/second/477/\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e1e\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e19\u0e34\u0e27\u0e32\u0e2a.html}} {{in lang|th}}\n\n[[Category:Thai historical television series]]\n", "name_user": "Miteix", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Destiny_(TV_series)"}

In one month, March 1998, 50 different wildflowers were reported in bloom.<ref>House, Gordon. \"Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Preserve (sic) Wildflowers in Bloom.\" March 1998.</ref>\n\nThe best time to view the flowers is in the spring and the best trail for flowers at this time is the Vernal Pool Trail. The one flower people come specifically to the Reserve to see is the [[Fritillaria biflora|Chocolate Lily]]. It is most often seen in April on the slopes of the Coronado Plateau (the area of the vernal pools). As the [[vernal pools]] start to evaporate, flowers grow in concentric circles around them. The most common flower around the vernal pools is the [[California poppy]].<ref>Chester, Tom. \"Field Guide to the Santa Rosa Plateau: Plants\"</ref>\n\n== Mammals==\nThe Reserve is known to be home to 27 species of mammal.  This includes 12 species of rodents.  The mammals include: [[American badger|badger]], [[California myotis]], [[coyote]], [[gray fox]], [[bobcat]], [[mountain lion]], [[California mule deer]], [[opossum]], [[black-tailed jackrabbit]], [[desert cottontail]], [[raccoon]], [[brush mouse]], [[cactus mouse]], [[California ground squirrel]], [[California mouse]], [[California pocket mouse]], [[California vole]], [[deer mouse]], [[desert woodrat]], [[dusky-footed woodrat]], [[Fresno Kangaroo Rat|Pacific kangaroo rat]], [[pocket gopher]], [[western harvest mouse]], [[Crawford's gray shrew|gray shrew]], [[striped skunk]], [[long-tailed weasel]]. Most mammals are nocturnal and so are seldom seen by visitors.  However, ground squirrels are [[diurnality|diurnal]] and are regularly seen. Coyotes are probably the second most common seen, then mule deer.<ref>Bramhall, Rick. \"Wild Mammals of the Santa Rosa Plateau.\" Plateau Press, 2003. Smashwords ebook edition, 2015.</ref>\n\n==Birds==\nThere have been at least 185 species of bird spotted on the Reserve. Among the larger birds, the mallard, black-shouldered kite, Cooper's hawk, red-shouldered hawk, golden eagle and American kestrel are known to nest on the site. The barn owl and great-horned owl have also had their nestings confirmed.<ref>Ludlam, Isabel P. \"Birds of the Santa Rosa Plateau.\" 1991.</ref>\n\nAnna's hummingbird are found year around on the Reserve while the black-chinned hummingbird is common in the spring and into the summer.

If you hear a commotion in the bushes, it may just be a rufous-sided towhee scratching through the leaf litter for insects and other invertebrates.<ref>Ludlam, Isabel P. \"Birds of the Santa Rosa Plateau.\" 1991. Commentary by Rick Bramhall, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Reptiles==\nThe reserve is home to the Southwestern pond turtle. They are on the list of Species of Special Concern. They are not allowed to be taken from their habitat. The longest turtles found on the Reserve are approximately five and a half inches. When they are wet, they are dark, making it easy for them to blend in with the mud at the bottom of ponds. They have webbed feet for efficient swimming and claws, which are used for digging nests, tearing meat, and during courtship. They mainly feed on aquatic invertebrates. They spend most of their lives underwater, which is also where they mate. They leave the water on a daily basis to bask, in order to regulate their body temperature.<ref>Pires, Marcelo. \"Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Turtles.\"</ref> In southern California, pond turtle populations have declined 95-99%.  The Reserve is one of only four to six reproductively viable populations of the Southwestern pond turtle in southern California.<ref>Pires, Marcelo. \"An Overview of the Status of the Southwestern Pond Turtle (Clemmys marmorata pallida) in Southern California.\"</ref>\n\nSnakes found on the Ecological Reserve include: San Bernardino ring-necked snake, Hammond's two-striped garter snake, coastal rosy boa, Western yellow-bellied racer, California striped racer, San Joaquin coachwhip, red diamond rattlesnake, Southern Pacific rattlesnake, San Diego gopher snake, California kingsnake.<ref>Unattributed. \"Snakes of the Santa Rosa Plateau.\"</ref>\n\nOther reptiles include: San Diego horned lizard, western fence lizard, granite spiny lizard, side-blotched lizard, western skink, western whiptail, San Diego alligator lizard.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Handout to docents.</ref>\n\n==Amphibians==\nAmphibians found on the Ecological Reserve include: coast range newt, garden slender salamander, black-bellied salamander, western spadefoot toad, Pacific treefrog, California red-legged frog, bullfrog.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Handout to docents.</ref> Bullfrogs are an invasive species, which because of their superior size, takes over territory from native species.\n\n==Geology==\nThe oldest rock seen on the Reserve is meta-volcanic rock, laid down 220-190 million years ago. Above that is found meta-sedimentary rock, consisting of slates, argillites and some  quartzite and limestone beds. Gabbro, consisting of feldspar, pyroxene and olivine, was laid down 143-101 million years ago. The granite on the Plateau arrived 119-105 million years ago. Arkosic sand and gravel was deposited by flowing water approximately 23-9 million years ago. Olivine basalt is from a lava flow of 9-6 million years ago.<ref>Loera, Dan and Steve Turner. \"A Geologic Field Trip Guide for the Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve.\"</ref>\n\n==Lichen==\nLichen found on rocks on the Reserve include species from genera Fruticose, Squamulose, Foliose,  and Crustose. Common species found on large rock outcroppings include [[Flavoparmelia caperata|common greenshield lichen]], beaded rosette lichen, [[sunken disk lichen]] and [[rim lichen]].<ref>Weber, Bratt and Larson, 1987 as noted by Tom Chester at tchester.org.</ref> Lichen are a symbiotic relationship between various species of fungus, which provide the structure, and algae, which provide the organism's nutrients.\n\n==Human history==\nThe first Native Americans are thought to have inhabited this area for more than 8,000 years. The Native Americans known as Luiseno, due to their connection to the San Luis Rey Mission, are believed to have arrived about 1,500 years ago. It is thought they only used the Plateau during the warm weather months, and to collect acorns in the fall. The rest of the year they lived in what is now known as the Temecula Valley. They had a village called Meha near the ranch on the Plateau. The midden found there suggests it had been occupied for approximately 6,000 years.<ref>Gonsalves, Myra. \"Temecula Valley History.\"</ref> When visiting the adobes, one can see indentations in boulders used by the Native Americans to grind acorns and other food.\n\nBefore the arrival of the missionaries, these people lived in bands, each of which had its own territory. The bands would have interacted with each other through ceremonial exchanges, marriages and trade. The territories included acorn gathering sites in the mountains. The acorns they liked the best were from the black oak, which only grows above 3,000 feet. In the winter, it was traditional for these bands to move to the coast.<ref>Sparkman, Philip, \"The Culture of the Luiseno Indians,\" 1908 as referred to by Paul J. Price in his lecture to docents, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, the mission fathers of San Diego decided there should be a mission between there and the San Juan Capistrano mission. Thus was formed mission San Luis Rey de Francia. Native Americans that fell under the jurisdiction of this new mission were all labeled Luiseno. When Spanish rule ended in 1822, the new Mexican government decreed that mission lands would be secularized. In California this did not happen until 1834. It was during this period that the plateau received its name, probably in honor of Saint Rose of Lima.<ref>Gonsalves, Myra. \"Temecula Valley History.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1846, Juan Moreno was granted 47,000 acres by the Mexican governor of California, Pio Pico. In 1855, Moreno sold Rancho Santa Rosa to Augustin Machado. After he died, the land passed through several hands before being purchased by John Deer of England, who moved here. After him the land went to his son, Parker Dear.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Visitor center handout.</ref> It is said that Parker Dear treated his Native American help like slaves and they would sometimes run away.<ref>Ibenez, Vincent as quoted in a letter from Myra Gonsalves to Rick Bramhall, Nov. 12, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1904 Walter Vail purchased the land, mainly to raise cattle.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Visitor center handout.</ref> When he died, the land went to his son, Mahlon Vail. Mahlon is said to have respected Native American rights to harvest acorns, gather wood and hunt on the Plateau. However, they were not allowed to bunk with the other cowboys and had to live off the ranch.<ref>Ibenez, Vincent as quoted in a letter from Myra Gonsalves to Rick Bramhall, Nov. 12, 1999.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[California chaparral and woodlands]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.rivcoparks.org/santa-rosa-plateau-ecological-reserve/ Official '''Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve''' website]\n* [http://www.seetheglobe.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=881 SeeTheGlobe.com:  Visiting the Santa Rosa Plateau]\n{{commons category|Santa Rosa Plateau|<br>Santa Rosa Plateau|position=left}}\n* [https://nicolecoxhiking.com/2017/03/18/santa-rosa-plateau/ Hiking '''Hiking with Nicole Blog - The Plateau''' website]\n* [https://nicolecoxhiking.com/2017/08/12/the-adobes-at-the-santa-rosa-plateau// Hiking '''Hiking with Nicole Blog - The Adobes at the Plateau''' website]\n\n{{coord|33.54336|N|117.26952|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Landforms of Riverside County, California]]\n[[Category:Parks in Riverside County, California]]\n[[Category:Plateaus of the United States]]\n[[Category:Santa Ana Mountains]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in California]]\n[[Category:Peninsular Ranges]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Riverside County, California]]\n[[Category:California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Grasslands of California]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Quercus engelmannii, Santa Rosa Plateau.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Engelmann Oak]] Woodlands]]\n[[Image:SantaRosaPlateaugrassland.JPG|thumb|260px|Grassland in the Santa Rosa Plateau, [[California]].]]\n[[Image:Bunchgrass prairie SRP.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Purple Needlegrass]] Prairie]]\nThe '''Santa Rosa Plateau''' is an upland [[plateau]] and southeastern extension of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], southern [[California]].

The midden found there suggests it had been occupied for approximately 6,000 years.<ref>Gonsalves, Myra. \"Temecula Valley History.\"</ref> When visiting the adobes, one can see indentations in boulders used by the Native Americans to grind acorns and other food.\n\nBefore the arrival of the missionaries, these people lived in bands, each of which had its own territory. The bands would have interacted with each other through ceremonial exchanges, marriages and trade. The territories included acorn gathering sites in the mountains. The acorns they liked the best were from the black oak, which only grows above 3,000 feet. In the winter, it was traditional for these bands to move to the coast.<ref>Sparkman, Philip, \"The Culture of the Luiseno Indians,\" 1908 as referred to by Paul J. Price in his lecture to docents, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, the mission fathers of San Diego decided there should be a mission between there and the San Juan Capistrano mission. Thus was formed mission San Luis Rey de Francia. Native Americans that fell under the jurisdiction of this new mission were all labeled Luiseno. When Spanish rule ended in 1822, the new Mexican government decreed that mission lands would be secularized. In California this did not happen until 1834. It was during this period that the plateau received its name, probably in honor of Saint Rose of Lima.<ref>Gonsalves, Myra. \"Temecula Valley History.\"</ref>\n\nIn 1846, Juan Moreno was granted 47,000 acres by the Mexican governor of California, Pio Pico. In 1855, Moreno sold Rancho Santa Rosa to Augustin Machado. After he died, the land passed through several hands before being purchased by John Deer of England, who moved here. After him the land went to his son, Parker Dear.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Visitor center handout.</ref> It is said that Parker Dear treated his Native American help like slaves and they would sometimes run away.<ref>Ibenez, Vincent as quoted in a letter from Myra Gonsalves to Rick Bramhall, Nov. 12, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1904 Walter Vail purchased the land, mainly to raise cattle.<ref>Hicks, Rob. Visitor center handout.</ref> When he died, the land went to his son, Mahlon Vail. Mahlon is said to have respected Native American rights to harvest acorns, gather wood and hunt on the Plateau. However, they were not allowed to bunk with the other cowboys and had to live off the ranch.<ref>Ibenez, Vincent as quoted in a letter from Myra Gonsalves to Rick Bramhall, Nov. 12, 1999.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[California chaparral and woodlands]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.rivcoparks.org/santa-rosa-plateau-ecological-reserve/ Official '''Santa Rosa Plateau Ecological Reserve''' website]\n* [http://www.seetheglobe.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=881 SeeTheGlobe.com:  Visiting the Santa Rosa Plateau]\n{{commons category|Santa Rosa Plateau|<br>Santa Rosa Plateau|position=left}}\n* [https://nicolecoxhiking.com/2017/03/18/santa-rosa-plateau/ Hiking '''Hiking with Nicole Blog - The Plateau''' website]\n* [https://nicolecoxhiking.com/2017/08/12/the-adobes-at-the-santa-rosa-plateau// Hiking '''Hiking with Nicole Blog - The Adobes at the Plateau''' website]\n\n{{coord|33.54336|N|117.26952|W|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Landforms of Riverside County, California]]\n[[Category:Plateaus of the United States]]\n[[Category:Santa Ana Mountains]]\n[[Category:Nature reserves in California]]\n[[Category:Peninsular Ranges]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Riverside County, California]]\n[[Category:California chaparral and woodlands]]\n[[Category:Grasslands of California]]\n", "name_user": "OvertAnalyzer", "label": "safe", "comment": "+Cat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Rosa_Plateau"}
