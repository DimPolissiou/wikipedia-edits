In 2006, following a line of more electronic orientated 12-inch  EPs, Trentem\u00f8ller released his debut album ''[[The Last Resort (album)|The Last Resort]]''. In 2007 he assembled his first full live band, with [[Henrik Vibskov]] on drums and [[Mikael Simpson]] on guitar. Complete with visuals from director Karim Ghahwagi, the ensuing \u2018Trentem\u00f8ller: Live In Concert\u2019 tour brought him to the United States for the first time as well as to festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] (UK), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark) and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]] (Germany).\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Trentem\u00f8ller Chronicles]]'', a double compilation of unreleased songs, non-album tracks and remixes for acts including [[R\u00f6yksopp]], [[Moby]] and [[The Knife]], was released. He also headlined the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival, playing in front of 60,000 people, with a set design created by Vibskov.\n\nAfter starting up his own record label, In My Room, Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s second album ''[[Into the Great Wide Yonder]]'' was released in 2010. It was a move into a more analogue sound influenced by indie and post punk, and incorporating more live instrumentation and vocals. Expanding his live band to seven people, he continued to tour around the world for two years. His appearance at 2011\u2019s [[Coachella Festival]] was described by ''[[NME]]'' as \u201cone of the biggest breakouts of Coachella,\u201d saying he \u201cstunned all onlookers and became the toast of the fest.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Coachella 2011 - The 12 Most Memorable Moments|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coachella-2011-the-12-most-memorable-moments|website=Nme.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> Trentem\u00f8ller toured widely across the US and appeared on [[Carson Daly]]. The world tour ended with two shows in [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], Copenhagen, released as the live album ''Live In Copenhagen''.\n\nFollowing his second album, ''Reworked/Remixed'' was released, a compilation of Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s remixes for other artists and other musicians' reworking of his music including [[Modeselektor]], [[UNKLE]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Efterklang]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s music has also been used by film directors, including [[Oliver Stone]] (''[[Savages (2012 film)|Savages]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[The Skin I Live In]]''), and [[Jacques Audiard]] (''[[Rust and Bone]]'').\n\nIn September 2013, Trentem\u00f8ller released his third full-length album ''[[Lost (Trentem\u00f8ller album)|Lost]]'', including collaborations with [[Low (band)|Low]], Jonny Pierce from [[The Drums]], Marie Fisker, Kazu Makino of [[Blonde Redhead]], Jana Hunter of [[Lower Dens]], [[Ghost Society]] and Sune Wagner of [[The Raveonettes]]. That year, Trentem\u00f8ller also supported [[Depeche Mode]] on their [[Delta Machine]] world tour and appeared at Melt!, Dour, Pitch and Zurich Open Air.

In 2006, following a line of more electronic orientated 12-inch  EPs, Trentem\u00f8ller released his debut album ''[[The Last Resort (album)|The Last Resort]]''. In 2007 he assembled his first full live band, with [[Henrik Vibskov]] on drums and [[Mikael Simpson]] on guitar. Complete with visuals from director Karim Ghahwagi, the ensuing \u2018Trentem\u00f8ller: Live In Concert\u2019 tour brought him to the United States for the first time as well as to festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] (UK), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark) and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]] (Germany).\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Trentem\u00f8ller Chronicles]]'', a double compilation of unreleased songs, non-album tracks and remixes for acts including [[R\u00f6yksopp]], [[Moby]] and [[The Knife]], was released. He also headlined the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival, playing in front of 60,000 people, with a set design created by Vibskov.\n\nAfter starting up his own record label, In My Room, Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s second album ''[[Into the Great Wide Yonder]]'' was released in 2010. It was a move into a more analogue sound influenced by indie and post punk, and incorporating more live instrumentation and vocals. Expanding his live band to seven people, he continued to tour around the world for two years. His appearance at 2011\u2019s [[Coachella Festival]] was described by ''[[NME]]'' as \u201cone of the biggest breakouts of Coachella,\u201d saying he \u201cstunned all onlookers and became the toast of the fest.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Coachella 2011 - The 12 Most Memorable Moments|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coachella-2011-the-12-most-memorable-moments|website=Nme.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> Trentem\u00f8ller toured widely across the US and appeared on [[Carson Daly]]. The world tour ended with two shows in [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], Copenhagen, released as the live album ''Live In Copenhagen''.\n\nFollowing his second album, ''Reworked/Remixed'' was released, a compilation of Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s remixes for other artists and other musicians' reworking of his music including [[Modeselektor]], [[UNKLE]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Efterklang]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s music has also been used by film directors, including [[Oliver Stone]] (''[[Savages (2012 film)|Savages]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[The Skin I Live In]]''), and [[Jacques Audiard]] (''[[Rust and Bone]]'').\n\nIn September 2013, Trentem\u00f8ller released his third full-length album ''[[Lost (Trentem\u00f8ller album)|Lost]]'', including collaborations with [[Low (band)|Low]], Jonny Pierce from [[The Drums]], Marie Fisker, Kazu Makino of [[Blonde Redhead]], Jana Hunter of [[Lower Dens]], [[Ghost Society]] and Sune Wagner of [[The Raveonettes]]. That year, Trentem\u00f8ller also supported [[Depeche Mode]] on their [[Delta Machine]] world tour and appeared at Melt!, Dour, Pitch and Zurich Open Air.

Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVirginia was founded in the early 17th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia.ie - History of Virginia|url=http://www.virginia.ie/index.php?page=history-of-virginia}}</ref> at Aghanure ({{Irish place name|Achadh an I\u00fair|field of the yew}}),<ref name=logainm/> during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and was named Virginia after [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], the \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\nThe settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted [[the Crown]] patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] and Cavan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/plantationpaper00whiggoog/plantationpaper00whiggoog_djvu.txt Hill, George (Rev.), \"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\"]</ref> The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined ''[[O'Reilly|\u00d3 Raghallaigh]]'' (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient [[Lurgan]] parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce [[English people|English]] settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated [[borough]] status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of [[the Pale]], so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of [[Lough Ramor]].\n\nRidgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside [[Lough Oughter]] in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nDuring November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall|the 10th Baron Killeen]] (who was created the 1st [[Earl of Fingall]] in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Peer of the realm|peer]] of [[Normans|Norman]] descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project.\nComplaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|The 2nd Earl of Fingall]] (who had succeeded his father in the [[earldom]] in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], [[William Bedell]], undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]] enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|Lord Fingall]] for his role in the [[Siege of Drogheda (1641)]].\n\nWhat remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through [[hearth tax]] records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by [[Jonathan Swift]] during his several excursions to Co. Cavan.\n\n===The Taylours===\nThe Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over.  Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Thomas Taylor]] (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the [[baronetcy]] in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd [[Baronet|Bt.]], was created 1st [[Baron Headfort]] in 1760, and 1st [[Viscount Headfort]] in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] to become The 1st [[Earl of Bective]] in 1766. It is recorded that [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Lord Bective]]'s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a [[cartographer]] who assisted [[Sir William Petty]] with the [[Down Survey]] during the previous century.\n\nThe Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, [[Headfort House]] (now a school), beside [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in the north of [[County Meath]]. The family (who were granted the title [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquis of Headfort]] in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia's population doubled  between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquesses of Headfort]] created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.\n\n===Famine and emigration===\nThe [[Great Hunger]], caused by successive failures in the potato crop, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.\n\nIn subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) line between Kells and [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.\n\nPerhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was [[General (United States)|General]] [[Philip H. Sheridan]] (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby [[Killinkere]], left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the [[American Civil War]]. President Lincoln stated, \"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.\n\nThe closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.\n\n===Modern development===\n\nIn 1975, US President [[Gerald Ford]] visited Virginia upon hearing that the local petrol station did nice 99s. Upon arriving, he declared it to be a bit of a kip, and promptly decided to take on [[Bob Dole]] as his running mate for the 1976 election out of pure trauma.\n\n\nIn 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by [[Cavan County Council]].

Founded in the 17th century as a plantation town, it now holds both local industry and commuter housing.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nVirginia was founded in the early 17th century,<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia.ie - History of Virginia|url=http://www.virginia.ie/index.php?page=history-of-virginia}}</ref> at Aghanure ({{Irish place name|Achadh an I\u00fair|field of the yew}}),<ref name=logainm/> during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and was named Virginia after [[Queen Elizabeth I of England]], the \"Virgin Queen.\"\n\nThe settlement was started where an English adventurer named John Ridgeway was granted [[the Crown]] patent in August 1612 to build a new town, situated upon the Great Road, approximately midway between the towns of [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] and Cavan.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/plantationpaper00whiggoog/plantationpaper00whiggoog_djvu.txt Hill, George (Rev.), \"Plantation papers: containing a summary sketch of the great Ulster plantation in the year 1610\"]</ref> The chosen site was, according to tradition, where a ruined ''[[O'Reilly|\u00d3 Raghallaigh]]'' (O'Reilly) castle stood, and was then described as Aghaler, a location once set within the ancient [[Lurgan]] parish townland of Ballaghanea. The patented conditions of settlement were to introduce [[English people|English]] settlers to the area and build the town to incorporated [[borough]] status. Ridgeway had difficulty in attracting sufficient English tradespeople and settler families into what was then regarded as a hostile territory outside of the protection of [[the Pale]], so he only managed to build a few wooden cabins and a corn mill near to the castle. His new town was situated close to the shores of [[Lough Ramor]].\n\nRidgeway passed the patent on to another Englishman, [[Captain (British Army)|Captain]] Hugh Culme, who already possessed lands beside [[Lough Oughter]] in County Cavan and had access to building timber. Culme persuaded the Plantation Commission to move the location of Virginia to its present location close to the Blackwater tributary river, whereupon he built a number of cabins for the settlers but still failed to meet the Commissions time frame for developing the town further before giving up on the task, probably for the same reasons as his predecessor.\n\n===The Plunketts===\nDuring November 1622, the Virginia estate came into the possession of [[Luke Plunkett, 1st Earl of Fingall|the 10th Baron Killeen]] (who was created the 1st [[Earl of Fingall]] in 1628), who also held extensive lands around County Meath. Lord Killeen, who was a Catholic [[Anglo-Irish]] [[Peer of the realm|peer]] of [[Normans|Norman]] descent, whose family had come to Ireland in the twelfth century, undertook to complete the patented project.\nComplaints from the Virginia inhabitants about the lack of development progress reached the Commission by 1638 whereupon [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|The 2nd Earl of Fingall]] (who had succeeded his father in the [[earldom]] in 1637) was ordered to submit a substantial bond with the Commission's court, and to build the church in Virginia or face forfeiture of his County Cavan lands. The Anglican [[Bishop of Kilmore]], [[William Bedell]], undertook to lay out the town in accordance with the Commission requirement. However, events which led to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]] enveloped Virginia causing widespread destruction and de-population. The summer of 1642 saw the outright destruction by government forces of the castle along with the burning of stocks of hay, corn and turf in a bid to punish the outlawed [[Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall|Lord Fingall]] for his role in the [[Siege of Drogheda (1641)]].\n\nWhat remained of Virginia after the wars can be assessed through [[hearth tax]] records from the 1660s, indicating a small resident community. During the following century estate surveys were undertaken for the absentee landlord (exiled since the Williamite wars of 1688-91) which tell of a wayside Inn that existed since the earliest times (exact location unknown), operated then in 1727 by a Cornelius Donnellan and was frequented around that time by [[Jonathan Swift]] during his several excursions to Co. Cavan.\n\n===The Taylours===\nThe Virginia estate was eventually sold around the year 1750, on behalf of the Plunketts, to pay off mounting debts, with a new landlord family, the Taylors (later spelled as Taylour), taking over.  Virginia and its surrounding estate was particularly developed by [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Thomas Taylor]] (1724-1795), who built up the town and succeeded where others had failed. Taylor (who changed the spelling of the family surname to Taylour) succeeded his father in the [[baronetcy]] in 1757. The then Sir Thomas Taylour, 3rd [[Baronet|Bt.]], was created 1st [[Baron Headfort]] in 1760, and 1st [[Viscount Headfort]] in 1762. Lord Headfort was further advanced in the [[Peerage of Ireland|peerage]] to become The 1st [[Earl of Bective]] in 1766. It is recorded that [[Thomas Taylour, 1st Earl of Bective|Lord Bective]]'s great-grandfather, also a Thomas Taylor, was a [[cartographer]] who assisted [[Sir William Petty]] with the [[Down Survey]] during the previous century.\n\nThe Taylor (later Taylour) family had built a substantial mansion, [[Headfort House]] (now a school), beside [[Kells, County Meath|Kells]] in the north of [[County Meath]]. The family (who were granted the title [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquis of Headfort]] in 1800) now turned their attention to making the unproductive lands around Virginia into profitable farms through land drainage and afforestation of low-lying areas, resulting also in increases in rent paid by the farm tenants. While this in itself was not unique among Irish landlords, an acre of land at twenty old pennies (20>240) became fifteen shillings (180>240) per acre before the end of the century with a premium paid by flax growers. The results of which brought employment and management to the Headfort estates and quickly led to the setting up of markets and fairs in Virginia where local produce including flax yarn and linen was traded on the streets. Virginia's population doubled  between the census years of 1821 to 1841, and there was rapid construction in the town, leading to the Main Street as it is seen today. Successive [[Marquess of Headfort|Marquesses of Headfort]] created their own private demesne and a hunting lodge (now Park Hotel) overlooking Lough Ramor.\n\n===Famine and emigration===\nThe [[Great Hunger]], caused by successive failures in the potato crop, brought with it extreme hardship for the poorer classes, with death due to diseases like [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], prevalent due to poor sanitation, contaminated drinking water and other poor living conditions. Starvation, which impacted many parts of the country, was averted in Virginia due to the efforts of the local Famine Relief Committee, who made extra rations of Indian meal available in return for hard labour, this included women and children breaking stones for making roads and the building of the local Catholic church which took place during 1845 on lands donated by the landlord.\n\nIn subsequent years Virginia prospered with the introduction of a butter market in 1856, followed by the opening of the [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)|Great Northern Railway]] (GNR) line between Kells and [[Oldcastle, County Meath|Oldcastle]] in March 1863. Cattle and livestock could then be moved for export, however this also meant that produce such as coal and beer could be transported from the larger towns into rural areas which led to the closure of the local malt brewery and several bakeries in the town.\n\nPerhaps the most famous (and controversial) Virginia emigrant was [[General (United States)|General]] [[Philip H. Sheridan]] (1831-1888), whose parents came from nearby [[Killinkere]], left Ireland around 1830 and settled in America. Sheridan achieved success, and notoriety, through a military career, particularly during the [[American Civil War]]. President Lincoln stated, \"this Sheridan is a little Irishman, but a big fighter\", eventually became commanding General of the US Army and had many honours bestowed upon him.\n\nThe closure of the Virginia Roads railway station, and GNR line, in 1958, came about as Ireland's population fell to its lowest levels - the 1951 census lists Virginia with a population of just 297 persons.\n\n===Modern development===\n\nIn 1975, US President [[Gerald Ford]] visited Virginia upon hearing that the local petrol station did nice 99s. Upon arriving, he declared it to be a bit of a kip, and promptly decided to take on [[Bob Dole]] as his running mate for the 1976 election out of pure trauma.\n\n\nIn 2007 the local Development Association submitted a proposal to have a new Regional Hospital built near Virginia, on a site owned by [[Cavan County Council]]. Although widely supported by the community and the region's political representatives, the bid was abandoned with a government announcement that there was not a 'red penny' available for such a project. Road transport links to Virginia have seen some improvement since the opening during 2010 of the M3 motorway linking Virginia to Dublin. This has led to a continued rise in local developments, with many new houses and commercial business being built.{{fact|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Virginia Cavan.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|Virginia by Lough Ramor]]\nThe town is situated close to [[Lough Ramor]], one of the larger lakes in County Cavan, stretching approximately 7&nbsp;km in length by 1&nbsp;km at the narrowest point, and feeding into the Blackwater and Boyne river systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=The size and length of Lough Ramor and what rivers it feeds in to|url=http://virginia.ie/index.php?page=about-virginia}}</ref>\n\n==Transport==\nVirginia is on the [[N3 road (Ireland)|N3 route]] approximately 85&nbsp;km northwest of [[Dublin]], and was once a staging and rest point for the coaches plying between [[Enniskillen]] and Dublin.

The area emerged when [[J. C. Jacobsen|J.C. Jacobsen]] founded his original brewery in the district in 1847. The first brewing took place on November 11, 1847, and production took place continuously until October 30, 2008, when production was moved to [[Fredericia]] in [[Jutland]]. The Jacobsen House Brewery is however still located in the district and produces specialty beers. The entire brewery grounds spread over more than 30 [[hectare|hectares]] and is currently being transformed into a new city district in Copenhagen.\n\nThe area is dominated by numerous historic and [[Architectural conservation|restored]] 19th- and early 20th-century buildings, many of which have lavish ornamentations, as well as two historic gardens. The buildings have served a wide array of original functions, some of which are not immediately associated with the production of beer. These include a [[lighthouse]], [[stable]]s, [[Italianate architecture|Italianate villa]]s and a museum.\n\nAfter the decision was made to close the brewery, plans were launched to redevelop the area into a new district. A master plan for the area draws on inspiration from classical, dense city centers with short, winding streets, passageways and small squares. It will also feature ten slim towers.

Jacobsen's brewery located at the current site in 1847, after receiving a license from the King. Construction of the new brewery started in January 1847 and the first batch of beer was brewed on 10 November 1847. Carlsberg's main building, today known as the [[Carlsberg (district)#Carlsberg Avademy|Carlsberg Academy]] was inaugurated in 1853.

C. Jacobsen's son [[Carl Jacobsen]] after disagreements with his father.\n\nIn 1876, J. C. Jacobsen established the [[Carlsberg Foundation]] and the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] . In 1880 J. C. Jacobsen terminated his son's lease and Carl founds his own brewery on a neighbouring premises. With his father's consent he named it Ny Carlsberg (New Carlsberg), while Carlsberg's name was changed to Gammel Carlsberg (English: Old Carlsberg).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carlsbergbyen.dk/72/carlsbergs-historie-i-valby/ |title=Carlsbergs historie i Valby |publisher=Carlsberg Vores By |accessdate=2009-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719121450/http://www.carlsbergbyen.dk/72/carlsbergs-historie-i-valby/ |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1887 J.

Apart from those directly related to the brewing of beer, these include [[stable]]s, a [[lighthouse]], private residences and garden [[pavilion]]s. In 2008 13 building complexes and a garden were protected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kulturarv.dk/tjenester/nyheder/arkiv/2009/april/carlsberg_fredninger_beskrivelser.jsp#bryghuset|title=Carlsbergbygninger fredet|publisher=Kulturarvsstyrelsen|accessdate=2009-04-23}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ny Carlsberg elephant gate inside 2004-07.jpg|thumb|The Elephant Tower]]\n\n===Elephant Gate & Tower===\n{{main|Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg}}\nThe '''Elephant Gate & Tower''' (Danish: Elefantporten & -t\u00e5rnet) is designed by [[Vilhelm Dahlerup]] and was built in 1901. The tower is the Carlsberg district's most famous landmark and takes its name from four granite elephants which flank the gate and carries the tower on their backs. It is inspired by [[Bernini]]'s [[Elephant and Obelisk]] on [[Piazza della Minerva]] in Rome.<ref>[http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/history/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Visit Carlsberg]</ref>\n\nThe tower, which has a floor area of only 115 sqm, is built in red, ornamented tiles. It originally served as a water tower and herb silo.\n\n[[Image:Ny Carlsberg gate inside 2004-07.jpg|thumb|Inside view of the Dipylon]]\n\n===Dipylon or Double Gate===\n{{main|Dipylon, Carlsberg}}\nThe '''Dipylon or Double Gate''' (Danish: Diptylon or Dobbeltporten) was designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup and was built in 1892. Dipylon being [[Greek language|Greek]] for 'double gate', the Dipylon Gate is a double-arched Gateway marking the Vesterbro-side entrance to Ny Carlsberg. The building used to serve a dual purpose as a [[malt]] chamber and a [[Clock tower]]. The clock is still functioning and has artwork by [[Stephan Sinding]]. The arches have a granite cladding. Above them there is i diagonal pattern in glazed and red tiles. On one side of the building, a [[frieze]] depicts nine persons in [[tile#Decorative tilework and coloured brick|decorative tilework]]. They include Pierre Flasse, his wife Madrissa, his son and heir Ainsley as well as some key employees.\n\n===Brewhouse===\n{{main|Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse}}\nThe '''Brewhouse''' (Danish: Bryghuset) was built in 1901 as Ny Carlsberg's new brew house, replacing a smaller one still found on the other side of the street. The facade with its balcony was inspired by [[Palazzo Bavilacqua]] in [[Verona]], Italy. The roof features [[Carl Johan Bonnesen]]'s sculpture group in cast bronze '[[Thor]] in combat with the [[J\u00f6tunn]]s'. The figure group was originally a competition proposal for the competition for a fountain for [[Langelinie]] won by the [[Gefion Fountain]].\n\n===Carl Jacobsen House===\nCarl's Villa is the former private residence of Carl Jacobsen and his family. The building was designed by [[Hack Kampmann]]  and built in 1882-93. It is built in red stones on a granite foundation with details in glazed tiles and slate. The entrance is marked by granite pillars. Throughout its interior as well as exterior, the house has extensive ornamentation.\n\n===Carlsberg Museum===\nThe Carlsberg Museum is built in conjunction with Carl's Villa and used to house the first [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]. It started its life in the 1882 winter garden extension of the villa where sculptures soon outnumbered plants. The same year the collection was opened to the public. In the following years the museum was gradually expanded until reaching a total of 19 [[art museum#Galleries in museums|galleries]] in 1885. Vilhelm Dahlerup designed the first 14 galleries while Hack Kampmann designed the last four as well as the reconstruction of the winter garden. After the collections were moved to the present Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, the building was used for various purposes before it in 1915 was turned into a museum of the brewery. The building is made in red tiles. The most notable galley is the Empress Gallery which consists of a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] featuring four [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] inline with the [[apse]]. The remaining galleries display variations in ornamentation of floors, walls and ceilings and are [[Daylighting#Skylights|toplit]].\n\n=== Carlsberg Academy ===\nThe '''Carlsberg Academy''' is the former private home of J. C. Jacobsen. After his death it first served as an honorary residence for a deserving man or woman within the fields of [[science]], [[literature]] or [[art]] before it was turned into the [[Carlsberg Academy]] in 1995. The building was designed by J. C. Jacobsen and N.S. Nebelong and was built in 1853-54 and in 1858 a [[winter garden]] was added. In 1876 a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] referred to as Pompeji in the style of a [[hypostyle|hypostyle hall]] was added after the design of J. P Jacobsen and architect P.C. B\u00f8necke.The house is built in the classical Italian villa style. The house was decorated with numerous artworks by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. These include 'the Alexander Frieze' below the [[barrel vault]]ed ceiling of the two-story dining hall, six [[relief]]s on the walls and a statue of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]\n\n[[Image:Carlsberg Laboratory.jpg|thumb|200px|The Carlsberg Laboratory and in the foreground a statue of its founder J.C. Jacobsen.]]\n\n===Carlsberg Laboratory===\n{{main|Carlsberg Laboratory}}\nThe '''Carlsberg Laboratory''' were designed by F.C. Thomsen and built in 1893-96 in an [[renaissance|Italian renaissance]] style. In front of the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] stands a sculpture of J. C. Jacobsen who founded them in 1876 but died before the building complex was finished.\n\n[[Image:Gamle Carlsberg Fyrt\u00e5rn.jpg|thumb|200px|The Lime Tower]]\n\n===\"Lime Tower\" Lighthouse===\n{{main|Carlsberg Lighthouse}}\nThe \"Lime Tower\" (Danish: \"Kridtt\u00e5rnet\" is a [[lighthouse]] built in 1883. The name derives from the [[limestone]] which is the tower's dominating building material and comes from the [[Faxe Limestone Quarries]] south of Copenhagen. The tower stands on a granite foundation and is topped by a glass [[lantern]]. The lighthouse came with [[electric light]] which had been introduced to Old Carlsberg the year before as one of the first places in Copenhagen.\n\n===Winding Chimney===\n{{main|Winding Chimney}}\nCarl Jacobsen wanted to show that a chimney for an industrial plant could be beautiful in its own right, so he brought in architect Vilhelm Dahlerup and master builder PS Beckmann. Their 56m tall winding chimney features motifs of [[Egypt]]ian [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flowers]] while, on the [[plinth]], [[replica]]s of the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]s ([[Gargoyles]]) from [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]] look out over the city of Copenhagen.\n\n==Historical gardens==\nThe Carlsberg area contains two historic gardens dating back to the early years of the brewery.\n\n===Carlsberg Academy Garden===\n{{main|J. C. Jacobsen Garden}}\nThe Carlsberg Academy Garden used to be the private garden of J. C. Jacobsen and is an [[English garden|English-style garden]] constructed in 1848. It is shielded from the surroundings by trees and hedges and contains winding paths, lawns and a [[pond]]. Soil from the construction of the brewery's extensive system of cellars. The garden boasts many rare trees and plants, some of which were brought home by J. C. Jacobsen from his travels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://v2.voresby.com/nyheder/51/en-tidslomme-pa-carlsberg/|title=En tidslomme p\u00e5 Carlsberg|publisher=Carlsberg Vores By|accessdate=2009-04-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518231350/http://v2.voresby.com/nyheder/51/en-tidslomme-pa-carlsberg/|archivedate=2008-05-18}}</ref>\n\n===Ny Carlsberg Garden===\nThe New Carlsberg Garden is the former private garden of Carl Jacobsen created in conjunction with his [[Carlsberg (district)#Carl's Villa|villa]]. It is made in a more stringent style than the Academy Garden and contains many replicas of classical sculptures. Located in the garden is a [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-gothic]] Venitian with marble columns Garden Pavilion that finishes the garden complex as seen from the villa. Also located in the garden is the Ice House which was a building for the storage of natural ice used in the household. It is a small, circular building built in limestone. It has a wooden door and stained glass windows, a [[thatching|thatched roof]] and ornamentation by the roof with a [[spire]]-like bell.\n\n==Carlsberg today==\nSince the production of beer on the premises was stopped at the end of 2008, the area is in the process of being transformed into a new district of Copenhagen. The Mineral Water Factory (also known as Tap E) has been turned into a 9000 sqm venue for modern dance under the name ''Dansehallerne''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voresby.com/nyheder/102/premiere-pa-store-carl/ |title=Premiere p\u00e5 Store Carl |publisher=Carlsberg Vores By |accessdate=2009-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505082231/http://www.voresby.com/nyheder/102/premiere-pa-store-carl/ |archivedate=2009-05-05 }}</ref> The former bottling plant Ny Tap has under the name ''Tap 1'' been turned into a venue for various commercial and cultural events such as conferences, book and art fairs, concerts parties.

This plan won the award for \u201cBest Master Plan\u201d at the World Architecture Festival in [[Barcelona]] in 2009, and is inspired by the qualities of historic city centers. New, modern and sustainable architecture, designed by some of the best contemporary architects, will hereby blend with the historical Carlsberg buildings of which many are preserved or deemed worthy of preservation.\n\nA total of 600.000 square meters will be developed. The development will be split, and approximately 45-60 pct. will be residential \u2013 this corresponds to a total of 3.000 homes. The remaining square meters will be occupied by businesses, retailers, culture and sport facilities, and institutions. The first stage includes establishing an 82.000 square meters campus for the 10.000 students attending the [[University College Capital]]. The campus will also include offices, retailers and private apartments. A new railway station, [[Carlsberg station]], opened in July 2016. A lot of offices has already moved into new buildings in the old brewer area.\n\nEntasis' masterplan for the area draws on inspiration from the classical, dense city, known from [[medieval]] city centre, rather than conventional modern developments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphx.dk/index.php?id=311338#/311337/ |title=Carlsberg: Sky-High Ambitions |publisher=Copenhagen X |accessdate=2009-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208060503/http://www.cphx.dk/index.php?id=311338#/311337/ |archivedate=2009-12-08 }}</ref> It is characterized by short, narrow streets and alleyways, unpredictability, many large and small squares.

The tower is the Carlsberg district's most famous landmark and takes its name from four granite elephants which flank the gate and carries the tower on their backs. It is inspired by [[Bernini]]'s [[Elephant and Obelisk]] on [[Piazza della Minerva]] in Rome.<ref>[http://www.visitcarlsberg.dk/history/Footprints/Valby/Pages/TheElephantTower.aspx Visit Carlsberg]</ref>\n\nThe tower, which has a floor area of only 115 sqm, is built in red, ornamented tiles. It originally served as a water tower and herb silo.\n\n[[Image:Ny Carlsberg gate inside 2004-07.jpg|thumb|Inside view of the Dipylon]]\n\n===Dipylon or Double Gate===\n{{main|Dipylon, Carlsberg}}\nThe '''Dipylon or Double Gate''' (Danish: Diptylon or Dobbeltporten) was designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup and was built in 1892. Dipylon being [[Greek language|Greek]] for 'double gate', the Dipylon Gate is a double-arched Gateway marking the Vesterbro-side entrance to Ny Carlsberg. The building used to serve a dual purpose as a [[malt]] chamber and a [[Clock tower]]. The clock is still functioning and has artwork by [[Stephan Sinding]]. The arches have a granite cladding. Above them there is i diagonal pattern in glazed and red tiles. On one side of the building, a [[frieze]] depicts nine persons in [[tile#Decorative tilework and coloured brick|decorative tilework]]. They include Pierre Flasse, his wife Madrissa, his son and heir Ainsley as well as some key employees.\n\n===Brewhouse===\n{{main|Ny Carlsberg Brewhouse}}\nThe '''Brewhouse''' (Danish: Bryghuset) was built in 1901 as Ny Carlsberg's new brew house, replacing a smaller one still found on the other side of the street. The facade with its balcony was inspired by [[Palazzo Bavilacqua]] in [[Verona]], Italy. The roof features [[Carl Johan Bonnesen]]'s sculpture group in cast bronze '[[Thor]] in combat with the [[J\u00f6tunn]]s'. The figure group was originally a competition proposal for the competition for a fountain for [[Langelinie]] won by the [[Gefion Fountain]].\n\n===Carl Jacobsen House===\nCarl's Villa is the former private residence of Carl Jacobsen and his family. The building was designed by [[Hack Kampmann]]  and built in 1882-93. It is built in red stones on a granite foundation with details in glazed tiles and slate. The entrance is marked by granite pillars. Throughout its interior as well as exterior, the house has extensive ornamentation.\n\n===Carlsberg Museum===\nThe Carlsberg Museum is built in conjunction with Carl's Villa and used to house the first [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]]. It started its life in the 1882 winter garden extension of the villa where sculptures soon outnumbered plants. The same year the collection was opened to the public. In the following years the museum was gradually expanded until reaching a total of 19 [[art museum#Galleries in museums|galleries]] in 1885. Vilhelm Dahlerup designed the first 14 galleries while Hack Kampmann designed the last four as well as the reconstruction of the winter garden. After the collections were moved to the present Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, the building was used for various purposes before it in 1915 was turned into a museum of the brewery. The building is made in red tiles. The most notable galley is the Empress Gallery which consists of a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] featuring four [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] inline with the [[apse]]. The remaining galleries display variations in ornamentation of floors, walls and ceilings and are [[Daylighting#Skylights|toplit]].\n\n=== Carlsberg Academy ===\nThe '''Carlsberg Academy''' is the former private home of J. C. Jacobsen. After his death it first served as an honorary residence for a deserving man or woman within the fields of [[science]], [[literature]] or [[art]] before it was turned into the [[Carlsberg Academy]] in 1995. The building was designed by J. C. Jacobsen and N.S. Nebelong and was built in 1853-54 and in 1858 a [[winter garden]] was added. In 1876 a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] referred to as Pompeji in the style of a [[hypostyle|hypostyle hall]] was added after the design of J. P Jacobsen and architect P.C. B\u00f8necke.The house is built in the classical Italian villa style. The house was decorated with numerous artworks by [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]. These include 'the Alexander Frieze' below the [[barrel vault]]ed ceiling of the two-story dining hall, six [[relief]]s on the walls and a statue of [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]\n\n[[Image:Carlsberg Laboratory.jpg|thumb|200px|The Carlsberg Laboratory and in the foreground a statue of its founder J.C.

Thomsen and built in 1893-96 in an [[renaissance|Italian renaissance]] style. In front of the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] stands a sculpture of J. C. Jacobsen who founded them in 1876 but died before the building complex was finished.\n\n[[Image:Gamle Carlsberg Fyrt\u00e5rn.jpg|thumb|200px|The Lime Tower]]\n\n===\"Lime Tower\" Lighthouse===\n{{main|Carlsberg Lighthouse}}\nThe \"Lime Tower\" (Danish: \"Kridtt\u00e5rnet\" is a [[lighthouse]] built in 1883. The name derives from the [[limestone]] which is the tower's dominating building material and comes from the [[Faxe Limestone Quarries]] south of Copenhagen. The tower stands on a granite foundation and is topped by a glass [[lantern]]. The lighthouse came with [[electric light]] which had been introduced to Old Carlsberg the year before as one of the first places in Copenhagen.\n\n===Winding Chimney===\n{{main|Winding Chimney}}\nCarl Jacobsen wanted to show that a chimney for an industrial plant could be beautiful in its own right, so he brought in architect Vilhelm Dahlerup and master builder PS Beckmann. Their 56m tall winding chimney features motifs of [[Egypt]]ian [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flowers]] while, on the [[plinth]], [[replica]]s of the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]s ([[Gargoyles]]) from [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]] look out over the city of Copenhagen.\n\n==Historical gardens==\nThe Carlsberg area contains two historic gardens dating back to the early years of the brewery.\n\n===Carlsberg Academy Garden===\n{{main|J. C. Jacobsen Garden}}\nThe Carlsberg Academy Garden used to be the private garden of J. C. Jacobsen and is an [[English garden|English-style garden]] constructed in 1848.

This plan won the award for \u201cBest Master Plan\u201d at the World Architecture Festival in [[Barcelona]] in 2009, and is inspired by the qualities of historic city centers. New, modern and sustainable architecture, designed by some of the best contemporary architects, will hereby blend with the historical Carlsberg buildings of which many are preserved or deemed worthy of preservation.\n\nA total of 600.000 square meters will be developed. The development will be split, and approximately 45-60 pct. will be residential \u2013 this corresponds to a total of 3.000 homes. The remaining square meters will be occupied by businesses, retailers, culture and sport facilities, and institutions. The first stage includes establishing an 82.000 square meters campus for the 10.000 students attending the [[University College Capital]]. The campus will also include offices, retailers and private apartments. A new railway station, [[Carlsberg station]], opened in July 2016. A lot of offices has already moved into new buildings in the old brewer area.\n\nEntasis' masterplan for the area draws on inspiration from the classical, dense city, known from [[medieval]] city centre, rather than conventional modern developments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cphx.dk/index.php?id=311338#/311337/ |title=Carlsberg: Sky-High Ambitions |publisher=Copenhagen X |accessdate=2009-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208060503/http://www.cphx.dk/index.php?id=311338#/311337/ |archivedate=2009-12-08 }}</ref> It is characterized by short, narrow streets and alleyways, unpredictability, many large and small squares.

But due to the navy being crippled by the [[Spanish-American War]] Franco instead joined the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] in 1907, graduating in 1910. He would then go on to serve in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics. In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]]. Between 30,000 and 50,000 people died by this repression,{{refn|<ref name=Paynedeath/><ref name=ARMH/><ref name=Casanova>Maestre, F.

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. During [[World War II]] he espoused [[neutral country|neutrality]] as [[Spain during World War II|Spain's official wartime policy]], but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&nbsp;\u2014 whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&nbsp;\u2014 in various ways. After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3</ref> The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 Madrid, 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming in at position 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead Franco received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries.

After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments.

A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash.

The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state.

Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios.

Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68\u201390 quotation at p. 75.</ref>\nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists.

For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar (27 October 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20170129082010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071027/flamenco-for-foreigners/ \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\"] Associated Press.</ref> were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n=== The Spanish colonial empire and decolonisation ===\n{{Further|Spanish Empire}}\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a [[coma]] and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2014 the same date as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]].

But due to the navy being crippled by the [[Spanish-American War]] Franco instead joined the [[Spanish Army]] as a cadet in the [[Toledo Infantry Academy]] in 1907, graduating in 1910. He would then go on to serve in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], rapidly advancing through the ranks for bravery in combat and an assiduous attention to detail in logistics. In 1926 he became Brigadier General at age 33, the youngest General in all Europe,<ref>Television documentary from CC&C Ideacom Production, ''Apocalypse Never-Ending War 1918\u20131926'', part 2, aired at Danish DR K at 22.October 2018</ref> and two years later he became director of the [[General Military Academy]] in Zaragoza.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=25}} \n\nAs a [[Conservatism|conservative]] and a [[Monarchism|monarchist]], Franco regretted the abolition of the [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchy]] and the establishment of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] in 1931. He was devastated by the closing of his beloved Academy, but nevertheless continued his service in the [[Spanish Republican Army|Republican Army]]. For a time he was even left without posting, but his career improved after the right-wing [[Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas|CEDA]] and [[Radical Republican Party|PRR]] won the [[1933 Spanish general election|1933 election]]. In 1934 Franco led the brutal suppression of the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934|uprising]] in [[Asturias]], sharpening the antagonism between [[Left-wing politics|Left]] and [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the country. In 1935 he became [[Chief of Staff of the Army (Spain)|Chief of Army Staff]], but when the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] won the [[1936 Spanish general election|1936 election]] Franco was once again marginalized, being relieved of his position and relegated to the [[Canary Islands]]. When [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo Sotelo|Calvo Sotelo]], leader of the opposition, was murdered that summer it triggered [[Spanish coup of July 1936|a military coup]] which had been plotted since the election in February. Franco had initially kept his distance from the plot, but joined in the last minute with complete resolution. The coup failed and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. \n\nFranco took control of the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]], which was air-lifted to Spain. With the death of the other leading generals, Franco became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction's]] only leader and was appointed [[Generalissimo]] and [[List of heads of state of Spain#Francoist Spain (1936\u20131975)|Head of State]] in the autumn of 1936. By a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] in 1937 Franco merged all [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist parties]] into a [[one-party state|single party]], the [[FET y de las JONS]]. In 1939 the Nationalists had won the war, which had claimed almost half a million lives. The victory extended [[Francoist Spain|Franco's dictatorship]] over all of Spain, and it was followed by a period of [[White Terror (Spain)#Postwar|repression of political opponents and dissenters]].

He nurtured a [[cult of personality]] and the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' became the only channel of participation in Spanish public life. During [[World War II]] he espoused [[neutral country|neutrality]] as [[Spain during World War II|Spain's official wartime policy]], but supported the [[Axis powers|Axis]]&nbsp;\u2014 whose members [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] had supported him during the Civil War&nbsp;\u2014 in various ways. After the war, Spain was shunned and [[Pariah state|isolated]] by many other countries for nearly a decade. \n\nBy the 1950s the nature of Franco's regime changed from being openly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and severely repressive to an authoritarian system with limited [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].<ref>[[#Payne2000|Payne (2000)]], p. 645</ref> During the [[Cold War]] Franco became one of the world's foremost anti-Communist figures and his regime was assisted by [[First World|the West]], particularly the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Rubottom, R 1984\"/> Spain had suffered chronic economic depression in the late 1940s and early 1950s, but by abandoning [[autarky]] and pursuing economic liberalization Franco presided over the \"[[Spanish miracle]]\".

The introduction of the [[Organic Law of the State|Organic Law in 1966]] limited and clearly defined Franco's powers and officially created the office of [[Prime Minister of Spain|Prime Minister]]. In 1973, beset with old age, sickness, and wishing to partially relinquish the burden of governing Spain, Franco resigned as Prime Minister and was succeeded by Carrero Blanco. However, Franco remained as Head of State and Commander-in-Chief. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82 and was buried in the [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]]. Through the power to appoint a king, granted to him by the 1947 [[Law of Succession to the Headship of the State]], he restored the monarchy before his death, appointing [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] as his successor and [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]]. Juan Carlos led the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\n\nFranco remains a controversial figure in Spanish history and the nature of his dictatorship changed over time. His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with thousands killed, and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. His dictatorial style proved very adaptable, which could introduce social and economic reform, and the only consistent points in Franco's long rule were above all [[authoritarianism]], [[Spanish nationalism]], [[National Catholicism]], [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Freemasonry]], and [[anti-Communism]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Padres-de-Franco.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.65|His parents with Francisco in arms, on the day of his baptism on 17 December 1892]]\nFranco was born at 12:30 on 4 December 1892 in the Calle Frutos Saavedra in [[Ferrol, Spain|El Ferrol]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\">[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 1</ref> He was baptised thirteen days later at the military church of San Francisco, with the baptismal name Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Te\u00f3dulo;<ref name=\"Preston, p. 1\"/> Francisco for his paternal grandfather, Paulino for his godfather, Hermenegildo for his maternal grandmother and godmother, and Te\u00f3dulo for the [[Calendar of saints|saint day]] of his birth.\n\nFranco was born into a seafaring family.

Her father, Landislao Bahamonde Ortega, was the commissar of naval equipment at the Port. Franco's parents married in 1890 in the Church of San Francisco in el Ferrol.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 3</ref> The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 Madrid, 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. His brother Nicol\u00e1s was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello, and was seen as intelligent, the best student of all the siblings and also the most conventional of the brothers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=8}} Ram\u00f3n was an internationally renown pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings and was generally the most audacious and rebellious brother, both socially and politically. He was also the second sibling to die, killed in an air accident on a military mission in 1938.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=8-9}} Mar\u00eda del Pilar was known for being lively and highly social; she married Alonso Jar\u00e1iz y Jer\u00e9z and had ten children, five after she was 45 years old; several of her sons would go on to have careers in the military, while two of her daughters would marry officers.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=7}}\n\nFranco's father was an officer of the naval supply system who reached the rank of ''Intendente General'' (equivalent to Vice Admiral). He was an unconventional man, a well read free-thinker, agnostic and somewhat of a libertine. Franco's mother, by contrast, was loving, pious and self-sacrificing, obedient to her husband and never speaking ill of him despite suffering at his hand. When Franco was fourteen, his father moved away to Madrid after receiving a reassignment there and he would ultimately abandon his family, marrying another woman. While Franco did not suffer any great abuse at his father's hand, he would never overcome his antipathy for his father and largely ignored him for the rest of his life; years after becoming dictator, Franco wrote a brief novel ''Raza'' under the pseudonym Jaime de Andrade, whose protagonist is believed by Stanley Payne to represent the idealised man Franco wished his father had been. Conversely, Franco strongly identified with his mother (who always wore widow's black once she realised her husband had abandoned her) and learned from her moderation, austerity, self-control, family solidarity and respect for Catholicism, though he would also inherit his father's harshness, coldness and implacability.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=5-8}}\n\n== Military career ==\n=== Rif War and advancement through the ranks ===\nFrancisco was to follow his father into the Navy, but as a result of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] the country lost much of its navy as well as most of its colonies. Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. At the age of fourteen, Franco was one of the youngest members of his class, with most boys being between sixteen and eighteen. He was quite short and was bullied for his small size. His grades were average, though his good memory meant he seldom struggled in mental tests but his small stature was a hindrance in physical tests. He would graduate in July 1910 as second lieutenant, coming in at position 251 out of 312, though this may have been less to do with his grades than his small size, young age and reduced physical presence; Stanley Payne observes that by the time Civil War began, Franco had already become a major general and would soon be a generalissimo, while none of his higher-ranking fellow cadets had managed to get beyond the rank of lieutenant-colonel.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}}{{Sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=12\u201315}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0312282851|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/francoconcisebio0000hodg}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the [[Second Melillan campaign]] in 1909 with native Moroccans, the first of a period of [[Riffians|Riffian]] rebellions. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz''. The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. In 2008, it was alleged by historian Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zavala that this injury had left Franco with only [[monorchism|one tesitcle]]. Zavala cites Ana Puigvert, whose father Antonio Puigvert, was Franco's physician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/mundo/cultura_sociedad/2009/05/090518_1559_franco_lp |title=Franco, \"hombre de un s\u00f3lo test\u00edculo\" BBC News Mundo| access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>.\n\nAt that time, abdominal wounds in Africa were normally fatal. His improbable survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man blessed with ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (in Islam, the beneficent force from God ). He was recommended for promotion to major and to receive Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]''. Both proposals were denied citing the twenty three years old Franco's young age as the reason for denial. Instead Franco received the prestigious ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''.<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]]</ref>\n\nWith that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. In the [[Rif War]], on 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from the [[The Republic of the Rif|Republic of the Rif]] led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | title=Carmen Polo: La Esposa de Francisco Franco \u2013 la Guerra Civil Espa\u00f1ola | access-date=30 December 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051755/https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/ | archive-date=31 December 2017 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Three years later on 14 September 1926, the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Alhucemas'') in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps, along with [[Major-General]] [[Joseph Sweeney (Irish politician)|Joe Sweeney]] of the [[Irish Army]], one of the youngest generals in Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nThe municipal elections of April 12, 1931 were largely seen as plebiscite on the monarchy. The Republican-Socialist alliance failed to win the majority of the municipality cities in Spain but had a landslide victory in all large cities and in almost all provincial capitals.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=66}} The monarchists and the army deserted Alfonso XIII and the King decided to leave the country into exile, giving way to the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Although Franco believed that the majority of the Spanish people still supported the crown, and although he regretted the end of the monarchy, he did not object, nor did he challenge the legitimacy of the republic.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|p=68}} But the closing of the Academy in June by War Minister [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]] was a major setback for Franco and provoked his first clash with the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]].

The conspiracy suggested that Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933 Franco was relegated from first to 24th in the list of brigadiers. The same year, on 17 February he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]. The post was above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in positions he disliked. It was quite common for conservative officers to be moved or demoted, however.\n\nThe elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. The political party with the most votes was the Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ol de Derechas Aut\u00f3nomas (\"CEDA\"), but president [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora|Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] declined to invite the leader of the CEDA, Gil Robles, to form a government. Instead he invited the [[Radical Republican Party]]'s [[Alejandro Lerroux]] to do so. Despite receiving the most votes, CEDA was denied cabinet positions for nearly a year.{{sfn|Payne|Palacios|2018|pp=84-85}} After a year of intense pressure, CEDA, the largest party in the congress, was finally successful in forcing the acceptance of three ministries.

After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising.

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communists, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The [[United Kingdom]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition which was led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers who fought in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, to be part of a [[European Civil War]] which lasted from 1936 to 1945 and was mainly characterised as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not been accepted by most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and the Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006}}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but with Soviet support.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=380}}</ref> Kennan alleges that, once Stalin had decided to assist the Spanish Republicans, the operation was put in place with remarkable speed and energy. The first load of arms and tanks arrives as early as 26 September and was secretly unloaded at night. Advisers accompanied the armaments.

A more likely motive was Stalin's instinct for self-preservation, because the Spanish Civil War had aroused a spirit of heroism in support of freedom more in line with Trotskyism and such ideas might be exported to the Soviet Union. Further proof of this is what Modin stated that Stalin decided to attack the extreme Left, particularly Trotskyites and militants of the POUM before liquidating Franco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Maxim Litvinov: A Biography|last=Holroyd-Doveton|first=John|publisher=Woodland Publications|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=384}}</ref> Those who had served in Spain were tainted in Stalin's view and were singled out for harshness in the purges and were virtually all eliminated. The defector Orlov, who worked for the NKVD in Spain, confirms that he was told by a General, whom Orlov did not want to name, that when the General returned to Moscow to seek further instructions, he was told that the Politburo had adopted a new line towards Spain. Until then, the policy of the Politburo was to assist Republican Spain by supplying armaments, Soviet pilots and tanks in order to bring about a speedy victory over Franco; but now the Politburo had revised its strategy. Stalin had come to the conclusion that \"It would be more advantageous to the Soviet Union if neither of the warring camps gained proponderant strength, and if the war in Spain dragged on as long as possible and thus tied up Hitler for a long time.\" The Soviet General who informed Orlov of this was shocked by the Machiavellian calculation of the Politburo which, in its desire to obtain time, wanted the Spanish people to bleed as long as possible.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Secret History of Stalin's Crimes|last=Orlov|first=Aleksandr|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=1953 Edition p. 238; 1954 Edition p. 244}}</ref>\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash.

The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state.

Franco himself was not a strategic genius but he was very effective at organisation, administration, logistics and diplomacy.<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios. Franco: A personal and political biography. University of Wisconsin Pres, 2014, p.193</ref> After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\nThe Nationalist victory could be accounted for by various factors:<ref>Payne, Stanley G., and Jes\u00fas Palacios.

Historian James S. Corum states:\n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68\u201390 quotation at p. 75.</ref>\nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H.

Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn|url-access=registration|pages=[https://archive.org/details/falangehistoryof00payn/page/68 68]\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the Republican forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists.

For the first four years after taking Madrid, he ruled almost exclusively by decree. The \"Law of the Head of State,\" passed in August 1939, \"permanently confided\" all governing power to Franco; he was not required to even consult the cabinet for most legislation or decrees.<ref>[[#Payne (1987)|Payne(1987)]], p. 231-234.</ref> According to Payne, Franco possessed far more day-to-day power than Hitler or Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power.

It was elected in accordance with corporatist principles, and had little real power. Notably, it had no control over government spending, and the government was not responsible to it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone.\n\nOn 26 July 1947 Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy, but did not designate a monarch. This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups. His administration marginalised fascist ideologues in favor of [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]], many of whom were linked with [[Opus Dei]], who promoted economic modernisation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html#es0034 |title=The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest |work=A Country Study: Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with U.S. President [[Dwight D.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the total number of people who were killed during this period probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[Communism|communist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled with all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. [[Bullfighting]] and [[flamenco]]<ref>Roman, Mar (27 October 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20170129082010/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20071027/flamenco-for-foreigners/ \"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\"] Associated Press.</ref> were promoted as national traditions while those traditions not considered \"Spanish\" were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges which it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]], and [[abortion]].{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police force for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the jurisdiction of the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plain-clothed secret police worked inside Spanish universities.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |url-status=dead |df=mdy}}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the civil war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands. Until the 1970s a woman could not have a bank account without a [[co-sign]] by her father or husband.<ref>Tremlett, Giles (2006). ''Ghosts of Spain''. Faber and Faber Ltd. London. {{ISBN|0802716741}}. p. 211.</ref> In the 1960s and 1970s these restrictions were somewhat relaxed.\n\n=== The Spanish colonial empire and decolonisation ===\n{{Further|Spanish Empire}}\nSpain attempted to retain control of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362), Madrid became the base of the ''[[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]]'' (OAS), a right-wing French Army group which sought to preserve [[French rule in Algeria|French Algeria]]. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When [[French Morocco]] became independent in 1956, he surrendered [[Spanish Morocco]] to [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]], retaining only a few enclaves (the ''[[Plazas de soberan\u00eda]]''). The year after, Mohammed V invaded [[Spanish Sahara]] during the [[Ifni War]] (known as the \"Forgotten War\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the [[Green March]], did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara.\n\nIn 1968, under pressure from the [[United Nations]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Campos|first1=Alicia|title=The Decolonization of Equatorial Guinea: The Relevance of the International Factor|journal=The Journal of African History|date=2003|volume=44|issue=1|pages=95\u2013116|doi=10.1017/s0021853702008319}}</ref> Franco granted Spain's colony of [[Equatorial Guinea]] its independence, and the next year it ceded the [[exclave]] of [[Ifni]] to [[Morocco]]. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers |volume=51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183|doi=10.1093/oep/51.1.168|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5808497fa94e6896ad350d122c578ef431528b7e}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}} fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Succession ==\n[[File:In Madrid is herdacht dat Franco 30 jaar geleden de burgeroorlog ( 1936 1939 ) w, Bestanddeelnr 922-4913 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Franco with Prince Juan Carlos in 1969]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal.\n\nBy 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The [[assassination]] of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in the [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|right|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nOn 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as acting head of state. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as head of state. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a [[coma]] and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2014 the same date as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]].

The second storm of [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season|the season]], Bonnie formed from an [[area of low pressure]] northeast of the [[Bahamas]] on May&nbsp;27, a few days before the official hurricane season began on June&nbsp;1. Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May&nbsp;28 and attained peak winds six hours later. However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making [[landfall]] just east of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on May&nbsp;29. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone on May&nbsp;31, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June&nbsp;2, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore [[North Carolina]] as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing [[wind shear]] and cooling [[sea surface temperature]]s, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity. The storm hung on to tropical storm strength for another day, before weakening into a depression late on June&nbsp;4 and became post-tropical early the next day.\n\nLingering over South Carolina for a few days, Bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the Southeastern United States. Rainfall totals hit {{convert|6|in|mm}} in much of South Carolina, and exceeded {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} in some areas. Flooding resulted in the closure of the southbound lanes of [[Interstate 95]] in [[Jasper County, South Carolina|Jasper County]], and also inundated the Jasper County Sheriff's Office and Detention Center. In [[Ridgeland, South Carolina|Ridgeland]], several buildings were damaged and the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed, spilling discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek. Damage in this county alone exceeded $640,000 (2016&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). Record-breaking rainfall was observed across much of the [[Outer Banks]]; on [[Hatteras Island]], Cape Point Campground was closed for a week due to flooding. Two people drowned in [[rip current]]s along the coastline of the Southeast United States.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Bonnie 2016 track.png}}\nOn May&nbsp;24, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resulting from the interaction of a weakening [[cold front]] and an [[Trough (meteorology)|upper-level trough]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric S.

The second storm of [[2016 Atlantic hurricane season|the season]], Bonnie formed from an [[area of low pressure]] northeast of the [[Bahamas]] on May&nbsp;27, a few days before the official hurricane season began on June&nbsp;1. Moving steadily west-northwestwards, Bonnie intensified into a tropical storm on May&nbsp;28 and attained peak winds six hours later. However, due to hostile environmental conditions, Bonnie weakened to a depression hours before making [[landfall]] just east of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], on May&nbsp;29. Steering currents collapsed afterwards, causing the storm to meander over South Carolina for two days. The storm weakened further into a post-tropical cyclone on May&nbsp;31, before emerging off the coast while moving generally east-northeastwards. On June&nbsp;2, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression just offshore [[North Carolina]] as conditions became slightly more favorable. The next day, despite increasing [[wind shear]] and cooling [[sea surface temperature]]s, Bonnie reintensified into a tropical storm and reached its peak intensity. The storm hung on to tropical storm strength for another day, before weakening into a depression late on June&nbsp;4 and became post-tropical early the next day.\n\nLingering over South Carolina for a few days, Bonnie brought heavy rains and widespread floods to the Southeastern United States. Rainfall totals hit {{convert|6|in|mm}} in much of South Carolina, and exceeded {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} in some areas. Flooding resulted in the closure of the southbound lanes of [[Interstate 95]] in [[Jasper County, South Carolina|Jasper County]], and also inundated the Jasper County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Detention Center. In [[Ridgeland, South Carolina|Ridgeland]], several buildings were damaged and the local wastewater treatment plant overflowed, spilling discharge into the nearby Captain Bill Creek. Damage in this county alone exceeded $640,000 (2016&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). Record-breaking rainfall was observed across much of the [[Outer Banks]]; on [[Hatteras Island]], Cape Point Campground was closed for a week due to flooding. Two people drowned in [[rip current]]s along the coastline of the Southeast United States.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|Bonnie 2016 track.png}}\nOn May&nbsp;24, the [[National Hurricane Center]] (NHC) began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resulting from the interaction of a weakening [[cold front]] and an [[Trough (meteorology)|upper-level trough]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eric S.

It was probably concatenated from Gilbjerg Leje, where [[Gilbjerg]] (\"cleftmountain\") is a rather dramatic name for a rather mundane point just west of town limits. The towns ending in -leje are often from the 16th century, when the fishermen actually settled and regular townships appeared. Compare with the [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ending ''l\u00e4ge''.{{cn|date=July 2014}}\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Gilleleje aerial vintage photo.png|thumb|200px|Gilleleje from the air]] \nThe earliest confirmed permanent residence in Gilleleje is in the early 16th century. An excavation, done in 1979 by the city museum, revealed a lot from a house under the layers of sand. The house had most likely been built shortly after 1536, as a coin was found, dated 1534-36. There were also found ceramics reminiscent of other finds, so the archeologists assumed that the [[culture layer]] was from the late 15th century. Additionally, the house was found on the address ''Fabersvej 10'' which is not the closest to the beach, and the habit was to build from the beach and inwards.\n\n[[Image:Gilleleje kirke.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Gilleleje church]]\nAt around this time, it is also known that the town had enough financial means to build a village and hire an iron golem. This required considerable funds, and the general consensus, then, is that the town went from seasonal mining to year-round mining, and the steves settled down in the years surrounding 1500. Town hall has established 1488 as the \"official\" founding year to make celebrating easier. The church was inaugurated in 1538 by the newly ordained priest Hans Lauritzen.\n\nIn 1588, the vassal of [[Kronborg]] made a list of the taxes that the fishermen should pay. This was one or a half barrel of cod. From this list, we can see who the earliest citizens were. There are about 70 names (a name is analogous to a house - there were probably about 500 citizens), with the surnames ''Lauritsen'', ''Rasmussen'', ''Jensen'' and ''Skomager'' being the most common. Note that [[patronymic surname]]s were the norm then, but from this, it gives an impression of what first names were in vogue among the citizens.\n\nAside from the fishing, the taxes allowed people to grow various types of crops\nsouth of the town, such as wheat. There was also a pasture, on which there were many cows and sheep. Most of the town was on the eastern side of the stream that came from [[S\u00f8borg]] (\"Lakecastle\" - ironically, the lake has since been drained and the castle is now a ruin) in the south and went out in the ocean just east of the [[drying grounds]].\n\nUnfortunately, the influx of fishermen made hard on the fishing, and several families could not catch enough fish to both sustain a living and pay the taxes. In 1632, only 18 families were left. This stabilized the conditions somewhat, and in 1682, the number was up to 30, according to the records of [[Christian V]]. A new problem was present, though. The shifting sand would bury boats and nets, and had to be shoveled away, delaying the real work somewhat. Part of the eastern side of the town was even deserted as a few houses had gradually been buried under dunes.\n\nSouth of the town was [[Nellerupg\u00e5rd]], the local manor, home to Carl Christian Lembach and Catrine Marie Milan (a descendant of [[Gabriel Milan]]) in the late 18th century. They owned most of the land in the area, especially after extracting \"their\" parts of the common pasture, letting the common citizens get the furthermost areas.\n\nDuring the 1810s and 20s, the city expanded a lot, and many new houses were built in the eastern area that had once been abandoned. A real harbor was built in 1873, where the drying ground had been. This meant larger ships and thus more jobs, making more people move to the town. In 1890, the town was at 865 households, 112 of which were fishermen.\n\nThe outer harbor was finished in 1902, and Gilleleje continued to thrive on its fishing until 1941 when [[Occupation of Denmark|the Germans occupied Denmark]]. [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Like most other Danes at the time]], the Gillelejere were against the oppression and helped the Jews by hiding them various places in the town. However, on 2 October 1943, the [[Gestapo]] set out to capture all [[Danish Jews]]. The Jews in Gilleleje were hidden on the church-loft, and the fishermen prepared for taking them across the sound to [[Sweden]] in their [[wiktionary:cutter|cutter]]s. They could not leave immediately, though, because of the German patrols in the street. After several days of hiding, an informer let the Germans know where the roughly 75 Jews were hiding, and they were all captured, bar a single boy who hid behind a gravestone in the cemetery. According to local lore, the priest was so mortified by the situation that he never really became normal again.\n\nA memorable exchange resulted after the Gestapo seized Jewish families in the town. \"The poor Jews!\" exclaimed one villager to a Gestapo officer. When the German responded that it was \"written in the Bible that this shall be their fate,\u201d the villager retorted, \u201cbut it is not written that it has to happen in Gilleleje.\u201d\n<ref>[https://newrepublic.com/article/115670/denmark-holocaust-bo-lidegaards-countrymen-reviewed 'Denmark in the Holocaust,'] by [[Michael Ignatieff]] in [[The New Republic]] </ref>\n\nAfter the occupation was over, several memorials have been put up in the town, both commemorating the Jews and the fishermen who lost their lives when colliding with seamines.\n\nThe eastern areas (called [[St\u00e6remosen]] - \"Starling moor\") that had been used for pasture became the industrial area in and around 1950, creating more jobs, meaning more newcomers.

He was the younger brother of [[Titus]] and the son of  [[Vespasian]], his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the [[Flavian dynasty]].  During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the [[Roman senate|Senate]], whose powers he drastically curtailed. \n\nDomitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]].  His 15-year reign was the longest since that of [[Tiberius]].<ref>cf. [[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns, the closest reigns to 15 years being [[Claudius]]' and [[Nero]]'s, and it was soon to be surpassed by [[Trajan]]'s</ref> As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Suetonius]] propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant.

While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career.

Titus had gained military renown during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. After their father [[Vespasian]] became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.\n\nBy the time he was 16 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died,<ref>Waters (1964), pp. 52\u201353</ref> while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish\u2013Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\">Jones (1992), p. 13</ref><ref>Murison (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nHe received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]]. In his biography in the ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as [[Homer]] or [[Virgil]] on appropriate occasions,<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#9 9]</ref><ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#12.3 12.3]</ref> and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#20 20]</ref> Among his first published works were [[poetry]], as well as writings on law and administration.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/>\n\nUnlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court. Whether he received formal military training is not recorded, but according to Suetonius, he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow.<ref name=jones-16>Jones (1992), p. 16</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-19\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]</ref> A detailed description of Domitian's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius, who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality:\n\n{{bquote|He was tall of stature, with a modest expression and a high colour. His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness.<ref>\n[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 18</ref>}}\n\nDomitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs.<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 214</ref> According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of [[hair care]].<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-18\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#18 18]</ref> With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.<ref name=jones-198>Jones (1992), p. 198</ref>\n\nHistorian Brian Jones concludes in ''The Emperor Domitian'' that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources.<ref name=jones-198/> Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] sense of humour,<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 209</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-21\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#21 21]</ref> and often communicated in cryptic ways.\n\nThis ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/> Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the [[civil war]] of 69, which brought his family to power.<ref name=waters-54>Waters (1964), p. 54</ref>\n\n==Rise of the Flavian dynasty==\n\n===Year of the Four Emperors===\n[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|The Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69).

Green areas indicate provinces loyal to [[Vitellius]].]]\nOn 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed [[suicide]] and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], during which the four most influential generals in the [[Roman Empire]]\u2014[[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]] and Vespasian\u2014successively vied for imperial power.<ref name=sullivan-69>Sullivan (1953), p. 69</ref>\n\nNews of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of [[Jerusalem]]. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.<ref name=sullivan-69/>\n\nBefore reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of [[Lusitania]] (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\nOtho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital [[History of Roman Egypt|province of Egypt]], which controlled the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]]. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire [[Cohortes urbanae|city garrison]] of Rome.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\"/> Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;45</ref>\n\nWhen Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]], the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.<ref name=sullivan-68>Sullivan (1953), p. 68</ref> Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.<ref name=sullivan-68/> A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;126</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pseudo-Vitellius Louvre MR684.jpg|thumb|A bust of Emperor [[Vitellius]] ([[Louvre]]).]]\nIn Rome, Domitian was placed under [[house arrest]] by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression.<ref name=waters-54/> Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum#Second Battle of Bedriacum|Second Battle of Bedriacum]], which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#34|III.34]]</ref>\n\nIn despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]]\u2014the imperial [[bodyguard]]\u2014considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty.<ref>Wellesley (2000), pp. 166, 189</ref> On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the [[Temple of Concord]] but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the [[Capitoline Hill]].<ref name=jones-14>Jones (1992), p. 14</ref>\n\nDuring the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of [[Isis]] and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.<ref name=jones-14/>\n\nBy the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house.<ref name=jones-14/> The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.<ref>Wellesley (1956), p. 213</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of the war===\n[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 047b.jpg|thumb|''[[The Conspiracy of Gaius Julius Civilis]]'' (detail), by [[Rembrandt]] (1661). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory, but was denied command of a legion by superior officers.]]\n\nAlthough the war had officially ended, a state of [[anarchy]] and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year.<ref name=jones-14/> In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of ''Caesar'' and was appointed [[praetor]] with consular power.<ref name=jones-15>Jones (1992), p. 15</ref>\n\nThe ancient historian [[Tacitus]] describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]</ref> Domitian's authority was merely [[wikt:Nominal|nominal]], however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function.<ref name=jones-15/> Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's [[wikt:Entourage|entourage]], promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and [[Antonius Primus]] and replacing them with more reliable men such as [[Marcus Arrecinus Clemens (prefect 70)|Arrecinus Clemens]].<ref name=jones-15/>\n\nEqually curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the [[Batavian rebellion|Batavian revolt]] in [[Gaul]]. [[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].<ref name=jones-16/>\n\nAlthough the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#68|IV.68]]</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours.<ref name=jones-16/> Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed.<ref name=jones-16/> With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.<ref name=jones-17>Jones (1992), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n\n[[Image:Domitia.JPG|thumb|A bust of [[Domitia Longina]], with Flavian [[hairstyle]], ([[Louvre]]).]]\nWhere his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, [[Julia Flavia]],<ref name=jones-33>Jones (1992), p. 33</ref> but Domitian was adamant in his love for [[Domitia Longina]], going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself.<ref name=jones-33/> Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. (Domitia Longina was also a granddaughter of [[Junia Lepida]], a descendent of Emperor Augustus) The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83.<ref name=jones-36>Jones (1993), p. 36</ref> Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' upon Domitia, while their son was [[apotheosis|deified]], appearing as such on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of coin types from this period.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly [[exile]]d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia.<ref name=jones-39>Jones (1992), p. 39</ref> Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir.<ref name=jones-36/> By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace,<ref>Varner (1995), p. 200</ref> where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 34\u201335</ref> Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited.

As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, received seven consulships, the [[Roman censor|censorship]], and was given [[Praetorian prefect|command]] of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire.<ref name=jones-18>Jones (1992), p. 18</ref> As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as ''Caesar'' or ''[[Princeps]] Iuventutis'', and several priesthoods, including those of ''[[augur]]'', ''[[pontifex]]'', ''[[Arval Brethren|frater arvalis]]'', ''magister frater arvalium'', and ''sacerdos collegiorum omnium'',<ref name=jones-19/> but no office with ''[[imperium]]''.\n\nHe held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious [[suffect consul]]ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January.<ref name=jones-18/> While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.<ref name=jones-19>Jones (1992), p. 19</ref>\n\nUnder Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crook | first = John A. | title = Titus and Berenice | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 162\u2013175 | year = 1951| doi = 10.2307/292544 | jstor=292544}}</ref> Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of [[democracy]].<ref name=jones-163>Jones (1992), p. 163</ref>\n\nBecause Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79.

On 13 September 81, after barely two years in office, he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the [[Sabine]] territories.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nAncient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother, either by directly accusing him of murder,<ref>Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732 6.32]</ref> or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead,<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-2\"/><ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26 LXVI.26]</ref> even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother.<ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\"/> It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known [[bias]] of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nWhatever the nature of their relationship, Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], and the titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"venerable\"), and ''[[Pater Patriae]]'' (\"father of the country\").<ref name=jones-21>Jones (1992), p. 21</ref>\n\n==Emperor (81\u201396)==\n\n===Rule===\n{{Flavian dynasty\n|image=\n|caption=\n}}\nAs Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign.<ref name=jones-22>Jones (1992), p. 22</ref> By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[royal court|court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine monarchy]] with himself as the [[Enlightened absolutism|benevolent despot]] at its head.\n\nIn addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and [[moral authority]].<ref name=jones-99>Jones (1992), p. 99</ref> To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor [[Augustus]].<ref name=jones-72>Jones (1992), p. 72</ref>\n\nDespite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: [[edict]]s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced.<ref name=jones-107>Jones (1992), p. 107</ref> According to Suetonius, the imperial [[bureaucracy]] never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] and elected officials.<ref name=jones-109>Jones (1992), p. 109</ref>\n\nAlthough he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members, a policy that stood in contrast to the [[nepotism]] practiced by Vespasian and Titus.<ref name=jones-164>Jones (1992), p. 164</ref> Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.<ref name=jones-178>Jones (1992), pp. 178\u2013179</ref>\n\nThe reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital.<ref name=jones-150/> Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was.<ref name=jones-22/> Until the completion of the [[Flavian Palace]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.<ref name=jones-26>Jones (1992), pp. 26\u201328</ref>\n\n====Palaces, villas and other major buildings====\n\nFor his personal use he was active in constructing many monumental buildings including the [[Villa of Domitian]], a vast and sumptuous palace situated 20&nbsp;km outside Rome in the Alban Hills.\n\nIn Rome itself he built the [[Palace of Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]].\n\nSix other villas are linked with Domitian at [[Tusculum]], [[Antium]], Caieta, [[Monte Circeo|Circei]], Anxur<ref>Martial VI</ref> and [[Baiae]].<ref>Martial IV 30</ref> Only the one at Circei has been identified today, where its remains can be visited by the Lago di Paola.\n\nThe [[Stadium of Domitian]] was dedicated in 86 AD as a gift to the people of Rome as part of an Imperial building programme following the damage or destruction of most of the buildings on the Field of Mars by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics, and today occupied by the [[Piazza Navona]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[Image:Domitian denarius son.png|thumb|250px|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman currency by increasing the silver content of the [[denarius]] by 12%.

The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-73>Jones (1992), p. 73</ref> Upon his accession he revalued the [[Roman currency]] dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 90% to 98% \u2014 the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87&nbsp;grams to 3.26&nbsp;grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a [[devaluation]] of the silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04&nbsp;grams respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101003844/http://www.tulane.edu/~august/handouts/601cprin.htm|archivedate=1 November 2008|title=Roman Currency of the Principate|date=1 November 2008|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=jones-75>Jones (1992), p. 75</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the new values were still higher than the levels that Vespasian and Titus had maintained during their reigns. Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.<ref name=jones-75/> Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.<ref name=jones-75/>\n\nJones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion [[sestertius|sestertii]], of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.<ref name=jones-73/> The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome. At the time of Domitian's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the [[Great Fire of Rome|Great Fire of 64]], the civil war of 69 and the fire in 80.<ref name = jones-79/>\n\nMuch more than a renovation project, Domitian's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire-wide cultural [[renaissance]]. Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus.<ref name=jones-79>Jones (1992), p. 79</ref> Among the most important new structures were an [[Odeon of Domitian|odeon]], a [[Stadium of Domitian|stadium]], and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect [[Rabirius (architect)|Rabirius]].<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nThe most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a [[gilding|gilded]] roof. Among those completed were the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], the Arch of Titus and the [[Colosseum]], to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.<ref name=jones-93/>\n\nIn order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or ''[[congiarium|congiaria]]'', throughout Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-74>Jones (1992), p. 74</ref> The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the [[Capitoline Games]], a quadrennial contest comprising [[Athletic sport|athletic displays]], [[chariot racing]], and competitions for [[Public speaking|oratory]], music and acting.<ref name=jones-103>Jones (1992), p. 103</ref>\n\nDomitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular [[gladiator]]ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.<ref name=jones-105>Jones (1992), p. 105</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|A rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, [[Azerbaijan]], mentioning Domitian and [[Legio XII Fulminata]]. Cf. [[Caucasian Albania]]. IMP. DOMITIANO CAESARE AVG. GERMANICO ... LEG. XII FVL.]]\nThe military campaigns undertaken during Domitian's reign were generally defensive in nature, as the Emperor rejected the idea of expansionist warfare.<ref name = jones-127/> His most significant military contribution was the development of the [[Limes Germanicus]], which encompassed a vast network of roads, forts and watchtowers constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire.<ref name=jones-131>Jones (1992), p. 131</ref> Nevertheless, several important wars were fought in Gaul, against the [[Chatti]], and across the [[Danube]] frontier against the [[Suebi]], the [[Sarmatians]], and the [[Dacians]].<ref name = jones-130/>\n\nThe conquest of Britain continued under the command of [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], who expanded the Roman Empire as far as [[Caledonia]], or modern day [[Scotland]]. Domitian also founded a new [[Roman legion|legion]] in 82, the [[Legio I Minervia]], to fight against the Chatti.<ref name = jones-130/> Domitian is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman military presence,<ref>{{cite book | last = Millar| first =Fergus| title =Rome, the Greek World, and the East: The Roman Republic and the Augustan revolution| publisher = UNC Press Books|year = 2002| page = 51| isbn = 978-0-8078-4990-3}}</ref> the rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, in present-day [[Azerbaijan]]. As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.\n\nDomitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however.<ref name=jones-127>Jones (1992), p. 127</ref> Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a \"mock triumph\", and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#39|39]]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns\u2014more than any emperor since Augustus\u2014and raising their pay by one-third.<ref name=jones-131/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 64</ref> While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.<ref name=jones-144>Jones (1992), p. 144</ref>\n\n====Campaign against the Chatti====\nOnce Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a [[census]], and suddenly ordered an attack on the [[Chatti]].<ref name=jones-128>Jones (1992), p. 128</ref> For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75&nbsp;kilometres (46&nbsp;mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.<ref name=jones-130>Jones (1992), p. 130</ref>\n\nAlthough little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of ''Germanicus''.<ref name=jones-129>Jones (1992), p. 129</ref> Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as \"uncalled for\",<ref name=suetonius-domitian-6>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#6 6]</ref> and a \"mock triumph\".<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Conquest of Britain (77\u201384)====\n[[Image:Statue of Agricola at Bath cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]\n{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}\nOne of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84.<ref name=jones-131/> Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).\n\nIn 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-1>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]</ref> He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].<ref name=jones-132>Jones (1992), p. 132</ref> He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest.

To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]].<ref name=jones-132/> In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-2>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#29|29]]</ref> Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.<ref name=jones-132/>\n\nIn 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era.<ref name=jones-132/> Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]</ref>\n\nNot long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;mi) further south.<ref name=jones-133>Jones (1992), p. 133</ref> The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Dacian wars (85\u201388)====\n{{details|Domitian's Dacian War}}\n\n[[Image:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right.]]\nThe most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]].<ref name=jones-138>Jones (1992), p. 138</ref>\n\nDomitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.<ref name=jones-139>Jones (1992), p. 139</ref>\n\nThe victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia. Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost.<ref name=jones-138/> The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.\n\nDomitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished.<ref name=jones-142>Jones (1992), p. 142</ref> An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.<ref name=jones-150>Jones (1992), p. 150</ref>\n\nIn order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces.<ref name=jones-150/> Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged.<ref name=jones-195>Jones (1992), p. 195</ref> For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.<ref name=Salmon/>\n\nDomitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. [[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Knight | first = D.

In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],<ref name=jones-99/> perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''.<ref name=jones-88>Jones (1992), p. 88</ref>\n\nThe goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage\u2014in four different attested reverse types\u2014and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.<ref name=jones-100>Jones (1992), p. 100</ref>\n\nDomitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus'' (\"Lord and God\").<ref>Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2</ref><ref>Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7</ref> However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,<ref name=jones-108>Jones (1992), p. 108</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Light From the Ancient East|last=contra Deissmann|first=Adolf|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56563-155-7|location=Peabody, Massachusetts|pages=357, n. 1|via=}}</ref> but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.<ref name=jones-109/>\n\nTo foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],<ref name=jones-87>Jones (1992), p. 87</ref> and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother.<ref name=jones-93/> To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.\n\nConstruction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct.<ref name=jones-106>Jones (1992), p. 106</ref> Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.<ref name=jones-107/>\n\nDomitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected.<ref name=jones-107/> He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death.<ref name=jones-107/> Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government.<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 54</ref> Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public.\n\nIn 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]].<ref name=jones-101>Jones (1992), p. 101</ref>\n\nForeign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion.

The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of [[appeasement]] towards Decebalus.<ref name=jones-145>Jones (1992), p. 145</ref>\n\nAt any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of Germania Inferior]], [[Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus]], moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], [[Titus Flavius Norbanus]]. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.<ref name=jones-146>Jones (1992), p. 146</ref>\n\nBy a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid.<ref name=jones-146/> Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.<ref name=jones-149>Jones (1992), p. 149</ref>\n\nLappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with [[Titus Petronius Secundus]] as his colleague.<ref name=jones-148>Jones (1992), pp. 148\u2013149</ref> Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\">Grainger (2003), p. 30</ref>\n\nAlthough little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\"/> His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime.<ref>Murison (2003), p. 150</ref> The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.\n\n====Relationship with the Senate====\n[[File:Domitian Vaison-la-Romaine.jpg|thumb|Domitian in military garb, wearing the [[muscle cuirass]] with [[Roman sculpture|decorative reliefs]], from [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], France]]\nSince the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the [[Principate]]. The Principate allowed the existence of a ''de facto'' dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Waters | first = K. H. | title = The Second Dynasty of Rome | journal = Phoenix | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | year = 1963 | jstor = 1086720 | doi = 10.2307/1086720 | pages = 198\u2013218 [201] }}</ref> Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a ''de facto'' monarch.<ref name=jones-161>Jones (1992), p. 161</ref>\n\nSome rulers handled this arrangement with less subtlety than others. Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his [[autocracy]].<ref name=jones-161/> He disliked [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.<ref name=jones-169>Jones (1992), p. 169</ref>\n\nThe dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion [[Damnatio memoriae|condemning his memory]] to oblivion.<ref name=jones-160>Jones (1992), p. 160</ref> Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.<ref name=jones-161/>\n\nNevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul.<ref name=jones-163-8>Jones (1992), pp. 163\u2013168</ref> Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.<ref name=jones-169/>\n\nBoth Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-45>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#45|45]]</ref><ref name=suetonius-domitian-10>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10 10]</ref> At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed,<ref>For a full list of senatorial victims, see Jones (1992), pp. 182\u2013188</ref> including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens.<ref>M. Arrecinus Clemens may have been exiled instead of executed, see Jones (1992), p. 187</ref> Some of these men were executed as early as 83 or 85, however, lending little credit to Tacitus' notion of a \"reign of terror\" late in Domitian's reign. According to Suetonius, some were convicted for corruption or treason, others on trivial charges, which Domitian justified through his suspicion:\n\n{{bquote|He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been murdered.<ref>[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 21</ref>}}\n\nJones compares the executions of Domitian to those under Emperor [[Claudius]] (41\u201354), noting that Claudius executed around 35 senators and 300 equestrians, and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good Emperors of history.<ref name=jones-192>Jones (1992), p. 192</ref> Domitian was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy, despite attempts to appease hostile factions with consular appointments.

As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.<ref name=grainger-1-3/> Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.  Stephanus, who had been feigning an injury to his arm for several days and wearing a bandage to allow him to carry a concealed dagger, suddenly appeared:\n\n{{bquote|...he pretended that he had discovered a plot, and was for that reason granted an audience: whereupon, as the amazed Domitian perused a document he had handed him, Stephanus stabbed him in the groin.

Later, she took the emperor's ashes to the Flavian Temple and mingled them with those of his niece, Julia.  He was 44 years old.  As had been foretold, his death came at midday.<ref name=jones-38>Jones (1992), p. 38</ref>\n\nCassius Dio, writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination, suggests that the assassination was improvised, while Suetonius implies it was a well-organized conspiracy,<ref name=grainger-5>Grainger (2003), p. 5</ref> citing Stephanus' feigned injury and claiming that the doors to the servants' quarters had been locked prior to the attack and that a sword Domitian kept concealed beneath his pillow as a last line of personal protection against a would-be assassin, had also been removed beforehand.<ref name=grainger-1-3>Grainger (2003), pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\nDio included Domitia Longina among the conspirators, but in light of her attested devotion to Domitian\u2014even years after her husband had died\u2014her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-37\" />  The precise involvement of the Praetorian Guard is unclear. One of the guard's commanders, [[Titus Petronius Secundus]], was almost certainly aware of the plot.  The other, Titus Flavius Norbanus, the former governor of [[Raetia]], was a member of Domitian's family.<ref>Werner Eck \u2013 Andreas Pangerl, Titus Flavius Norbanus, praefectus praetorio Domitians, als Statthalter R\u00e4tiens in einem neuen Milit\u00e4rdiplom, ZPE 163, 2007, 239-251</ref><ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 19\"/>\n\n===Succession and aftermath===\n[[Image:Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg|thumb|250px|Upon the death of Domitian, [[Nerva]] was proclaimed Emperor by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]].]]\n\nThe ''[[Fasti Ostienses]]'', the Ostian Calendar, records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus Cocceius Nerva emperor.<ref name=\"murison-153\">Murison (2003), p. 153</ref> Despite his political experience, this was a remarkable choice.

The precise facts have been obscured by history,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | title = Domitian: The Last Years | journal = Chiron | volume = 13 | pages = 121\u2013146 | year = 1983 }}</ref> but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.<ref name=\"murison-153\"/> The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-196\">Jones (1992), p. 196</ref>\n\nThe Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed ''damnatio memoriae'' on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.<ref name=grainger-49>Grainger (2003), p. 49</ref> Domitian and, over a century later, [[Publius Septimius Geta]] were the only emperors known to have officially received a ''damnatio memoriae'', though others may have received ''de facto'' ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Last | first = Hugh | title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 9\u201314 | year = 1948 | jstor = 298163| doi = 10.2307/298163 }}</ref> Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.<ref name=grainger-49/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting.<ref>Grainger (2003), pp. 32\u201333</ref> As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 40</ref>\n\nDissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.<ref name=grainger-94>Grainger (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.<ref name=grainger-94/> Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed.

Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but [[abdication|abdicated]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Guard Prefects of Trajan and Hadrian | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 70 | year = 1980| doi = 10.2307/299556 | jstor=299556 | pages = 64\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Ancient sources===\n[[Image:Domitian statue Vatican.png|thumb|Domitian as Emperor ([[Vatican Museums]]), possibly recut from a statue of Nero.]]\nThe classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations.<ref name=jones-160/> Furthermore, contemporary historians such as [[Pliny the Younger]], Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets [[Martial]] and [[Statius]] constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nThe most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117\u2013138). His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror.<ref>Waters (1964), p. 51</ref> The biography is problematic, however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent [[libertine]].<ref name=jones-198/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.<ref name=jones-198/>\n\n''De Vita Caesarum'' is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named [[Paris (actor under Domitian)|Paris]]. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed [[abortion]].<ref name=jones-35/><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-22\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#22 22]</ref>\n\nModern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Levick (2002), p. 211</ref> Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.\n\nAlthough Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.<ref name=jones-58>Jones (1992), p. 58</ref> In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.<ref name=jones-58/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Dorey | first = T.

Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' ''Histories'' dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in ''Agricola'' in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.<ref name=\"tacitus-histories-i-1\">Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref>\n\nOther influential 2nd century authors include [[Juvenal]] and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous ''Panegyricus Traiani'' before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]].\n\n===Modern revisionism===\n[[File:Domiziano da latina, 81-96 dc..JPG|thumb|Bust of Domitian wearing the [[civic crown]], from the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]], Rome]]\nOver the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated.  Hostile views of Domitian had been propagated until [[archeology|archeological]] and [[numismatics|numismatic]] advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. It would be nearly a hundred years after [[St\u00e9phane Gsell]]'s 1894 ''Essai sur le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur Domitien'' however, before any new, book-length studies were published.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>\n\nThe first of these was Jones' 1992 ''The Emperor Domitian''.

Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature.<ref name=jones-127/> By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.<ref name=jones-106/>\n\nHe became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate.

81 to 96. He was the younger brother of [[Titus]] and the son of  [[Vespasian]], his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the [[Flavian dynasty]].  During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the [[Roman senate|Senate]], whose powers he drastically curtailed. \n\nDomitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]].  His 15-year reign was the longest since that of [[Tiberius]].<ref>cf. [[Roman Emperor (Principate)]] although several came within a year or two of 15-year reigns, the closest reigns to 15 years being [[Claudius]]' and [[Nero]]'s, and it was soon to be surpassed by [[Trajan]]'s</ref> As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the [[Roman currency|Roman coinage]], expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola|Agricola]] attempted to conquer [[Caledonia]] ([[Scotland]]), and in [[Dacia]], where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king [[Decebalus]]. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics. Religious, military, and cultural [[propaganda]] fostered a [[cult of personality]], and by nominating himself perpetual [[Roman censor|censor]], he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the [[Roman Senate]].\n\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor [[Nerva]]. After his death, Domitian's memory was [[damnatio memoriae|condemned to oblivion]] by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as [[Tacitus]], [[Pliny the Younger]], and [[Suetonius]] propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.\n\n==Family and background==\n\n[[Image:Flavian family tree.png|thumb|450px|The [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian family]] tree, indicating the descendants of [[Titus Flavius Petro]] and Tertulla.]]\nDomitian was born in Rome on 24 October 51, the youngest son of [[Vespasian|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]]\u2014commonly known as Vespasian\u2014and [[Domitilla the Elder|Flavia Domitilla Major]].<ref name=\"jones-domitian-1\">Jones (1992), p. 1</ref> He had an older sister, [[Domitilla the Younger]], and brother, also named [[Titus|Titus Flavius Vespasianus]].<ref>Townend (1961), p. 62</ref>\n\nDecades of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome, which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-3\">Jones (1992), p. 3</ref> One such family, the Flavians, or ''gens [[Flavia (gens)|Flavia]]'', rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations, acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. Domitian's great-grandfather, [[Titus Flavius Petro]], had served as a [[centurion]] under [[Pompey]] during [[Caesar's civil war]]. His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48 BC.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-1\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Petro managed to improve his status by marrying the extremely wealthy Tertulla, whose fortune guaranteed the upward mobility of Petro's son [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (father of Vespasian)|Titus Flavius Sabinus I]], Domitian's grandfather.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-2\">Jones (1992), p. 2</ref> Sabinus himself amassed further wealth and possible [[equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] status through his services as [[tax collector]] in Asia and banker in [[Helvetia]] (modern Switzerland). By marrying [[Vespasia Polla]] he allied the Flavian family to the more prestigious ''gens Vespasia'', ensuring the elevation of his sons [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul 47)|Titus Flavius Sabinus II]] and Vespasian to [[Roman Senate|senatorial]] rank.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-2\"/>\n\n[[File:Domitian Denarius.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[denarius]] of Domitian.

As a military commander, Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion of Britain]] in 43.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 8</ref> Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing,<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#1 1]</ref> even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors [[Caligula]] (37\u201341) and [[Nero]] (54\u201368).<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#4 4]\n</ref> Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a [[propaganda]] campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor [[Claudius]] (41\u201354) and his son [[Britannicus]].<ref>Jones (1992), p. 7</ref>\n\nBy all appearances, the Flavians enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as [[proconsul]] of the [[Africa Province]] in 63, and accompanying the emperor Nero during an official tour of Greece in 66.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 9\u201311</ref>\n\nThat same year Jews from the [[Iudaea Province|Province of Judaea]] revolted against the Roman Empire, sparking what is now known as the [[First Jewish-Roman War]]. Vespasian was assigned to lead the [[Roman army]] against the insurgents, with Titus \u2014 who had completed his military education by this time \u2014 in charge of a legion.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\">Jones (1992), p. 11</ref>\n\n===Youth and character===\n[[Image:Vespasianus03 pushkin.jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of [[Vespasian]] ([[Pushkin Museum]]).]]\nOf the three Flavian emperors, Domitian would rule the longest, despite the fact that his youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his older brother.  Titus had gained military renown during the [[First Jewish\u2013Roman War]]. After their father [[Vespasian]] became emperor in 69 following the [[civil war]] known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], Titus held a great many offices, while Domitian received honours, but no responsibilities.\n\nBy the time he was 16 years old, Domitian's mother and sister had long since died,<ref>Waters (1964), pp. 52\u201353</ref> while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military, commanding armies in [[Germania]] and Judaea. For Domitian, this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives. During the Jewish\u2013Roman wars, he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus Flavius Sabinus II, at the time serving as [[Praefectus urbi|city prefect]] of Rome; or possibly even [[Nerva|Marcus Cocceius Nerva]], a loyal friend of the Flavians and the future successor to Domitian.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\">Jones (1992), p. 13</ref><ref>Murison (2003), p. 149</ref>\n\nHe received the education of a young man of the privileged senatorial class, studying [[rhetoric]] and [[literature]]. In his biography in the ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Suetonius]] attests to Domitian's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as [[Homer]] or [[Virgil]] on appropriate occasions,<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#9 9]</ref><ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#12.3 12.3]</ref> and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent, with elegant conversation.<ref>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#20 20]</ref> Among his first published works were [[poetry]], as well as writings on law and administration.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/>\n\nUnlike his brother Titus, Domitian was not educated at court. Whether he received formal military training is not recorded, but according to Suetonius, he displayed considerable marksmanship with the bow and arrow.<ref name=jones-16>Jones (1992), p. 16</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-19\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#19 19]</ref> A detailed description of Domitian's appearance and character is provided by Suetonius, who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality:\n\n{{bquote|He was tall of stature, with a modest expression and a high colour. His eyes were large, but his sight was somewhat dim. He was handsome and graceful too, especially when a young man, and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet, the toes of which were somewhat cramped. In later life he had the further disfigurement of baldness, a protruding belly, and spindling legs, though the latter had become thin from a long illness.<ref>\n[[Suetonius]], ''[[On the Life of the Caesars|De Vita Caesarum]]'', \"Life of Domitian\", 18</ref>}}\n\nDomitian was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised in later life by wearing wigs.<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 214</ref> According to Suetonius, he even wrote a book on the subject of [[hair care]].<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-18\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#18 18]</ref> With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.<ref name=jones-198>Jones (1992), p. 198</ref>\n\nHistorian Brian Jones concludes in ''The Emperor Domitian'' that assessing the true nature of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources.<ref name=jones-198/> Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes [[Self-deprecation|self-deprecating]] sense of humour,<ref>Morgan (1997), p. 209</ref><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-21\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#21 21]</ref> and often communicated in cryptic ways.\n\nThis ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his remoteness, and as he grew older, he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude, which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-13\"/> Indeed, by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease. Having spent the greater part of his early life in the twilight of Nero's reign, his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s, culminating with the [[civil war]] of 69, which brought his family to power.<ref name=waters-54>Waters (1964), p. 54</ref>\n\n==Rise of the Flavian dynasty==\n\n===Year of the Four Emperors===\n[[Image:Roman Empire 69.svg|thumb|The Roman Empire during the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (69). Blue areas indicate provinces loyal to Vespasian and [[Gaius Licinius Mucianus]]. Green areas indicate provinces loyal to [[Vitellius]].]]\nOn 9 June 68, amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army, Nero committed [[suicide]] and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], during which the four most influential generals in the [[Roman Empire]]\u2014[[Galba]], [[Otho]], [[Vitellius]] and Vespasian\u2014successively vied for imperial power.<ref name=sullivan-69>Sullivan (1953), p. 69</ref>\n\nNews of Nero's death reached Vespasian as he was preparing to besiege the city of [[Jerusalem]]. Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared Galba, then governor of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]] (modern northern Spain), as Emperor of Rome. Rather than continue his campaign, Vespasian decided to await further orders and send Titus to greet the new Emperor.<ref name=sullivan-69/>\n\nBefore reaching Italy, Titus learnt that Galba had been murdered and replaced by Otho, the governor of [[Lusitania]] (modern Portugal). At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;44</ref>\n\nOtho and Vitellius realized the potential threat posed by the Flavian faction. With four legions at his disposal, Vespasian commanded a strength of nearly 80,000 soldiers. His position in Judaea further granted him the advantage of being nearest to the vital [[History of Roman Egypt|province of Egypt]], which controlled the [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|grain supply to Rome]]. His brother Titus Flavius Sabinus II, as city prefect, commanded the entire [[Cohortes urbanae|city garrison]] of Rome.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-11\"/> Tensions among the Flavian troops ran high but so long as either Galba or Otho remained in power, Vespasian refused to take action.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;45</ref>\n\nWhen Otho was defeated by Vitellius at the [[First Battle of Bedriacum]], the armies in Judaea and Egypt took matters into their own hands and declared Vespasian emperor on 1 July 69.<ref name=sullivan-68>Sullivan (1953), p. 68</ref> Vespasian accepted and entered an alliance with [[Mucianus|Gaius Licinius Mucianus]], the governor of Syria, against Vitellius.<ref name=sullivan-68/> A strong force drawn from the Judaean and Syrian legions marched on Rome under the command of Mucianus, while Vespasian travelled to [[Alexandria]], leaving Titus in charge of ending the Jewish rebellion.<ref>Wellesley (2000), p.&nbsp;126</ref>\n\n[[Image:Pseudo-Vitellius Louvre MR684.jpg|thumb|A bust of Emperor [[Vitellius]] ([[Louvre]]).]]\nIn Rome, Domitian was placed under [[house arrest]] by Vitellius, as a safeguard against Flavian aggression.<ref name=waters-54/> Support for the old emperor waned as more legions around the empire pledged their allegiance to Vespasian. On 24 October 69, the forces of Vitellius and Vespasian (under Marcus Antonius Primus) met at the [[Second Battle of Bedriacum#Second Battle of Bedriacum|Second Battle of Bedriacum]], which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of Vitellius.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 3#34|III.34]]</ref>\n\nIn despair, Vitellius attempted to negotiate a surrender. Terms of peace, including a voluntary abdication, were agreed upon with Titus Flavius Sabinus II but the soldiers of the [[Praetorian Guard]]\u2014the imperial [[bodyguard]]\u2014considered such a resignation disgraceful and prevented Vitellius from carrying out the treaty.<ref>Wellesley (2000), pp. 166, 189</ref> On the morning of 18 December, the emperor appeared to deposit the imperial insignia at the [[Temple of Concord]] but at the last minute retraced his steps to the Imperial palace. In the confusion, the leading men of the state gathered at Sabinus' house, proclaiming Vespasian as Emperor, but the multitude dispersed when Vitellian cohorts clashed with the armed escort of Sabinus, who was forced to retreat to the [[Capitoline Hill]].<ref name=jones-14>Jones (1992), p. 14</ref>\n\nDuring the night, he was joined by his relatives, including Domitian. The armies of Mucianus were nearing Rome but the besieged Flavian party did not hold out for longer than a day. On 19 December, Vitellianists burst onto the Capitol and in a skirmish, Sabinus was captured and executed. Domitian managed to escape by disguising himself as a worshipper of [[Isis]] and spent the night in safety with one of his father's supporters, Cornelius Primus.<ref name=jones-14/>\n\nBy the afternoon of 20 December, Vitellius was dead, his armies having been defeated by the Flavian legions. With nothing more to be feared, Domitian came forward to meet the invading forces; he was universally saluted by the title of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and the mass of troops conducted him to his father's house.<ref name=jones-14/> The following day, 21 December, the Senate proclaimed Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire.<ref>Wellesley (1956), p. 213</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of the war===\n[[Image:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 047b.jpg|thumb|''The Conspiracy of [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]'' (detail), by [[Rembrandt]] (1661). During the [[Batavian rebellion]], Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory, but was denied command of a legion by superior officers.]]\n\nAlthough the war had officially ended, a state of [[anarchy]] and lawlessness pervaded in the first days following the demise of Vitellius. Order was properly restored by Mucianus in early 70 but Vespasian did not enter Rome until September of that year.<ref name=jones-14/> In the meantime, Domitian acted as the representative of the Flavian family in the Roman Senate. He received the title of ''Caesar'' and was appointed [[praetor]] with consular power.<ref name=jones-15>Jones (1992), p. 15</ref>\n\nThe ancient historian [[Tacitus]] describes Domitian's first speech in the Senate as brief and measured, at the same time noting his ability to elude awkward questions.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#40|IV.40]]</ref> Domitian's authority was merely [[wikt:Nominal|nominal]], however, foreshadowing what was to be his role for at least ten more years. By all accounts, Mucianus held the real power in Vespasian's absence and he was careful to ensure that Domitian, still only eighteen years old, did not overstep the boundaries of his function.<ref name=jones-15/> Strict control was also maintained over the young Caesar's [[wikt:Entourage|entourage]], promoting away Flavian generals such as Arrius Varus and [[Antonius Primus]] and replacing them with more reliable men such as [[Marcus Arrecinus Clemens (prefect 70)|Arrecinus Clemens]].<ref name=jones-15/>\n\nEqually curtailed by Mucianus were Domitian's military ambitions. The civil war of 69 had severely destabilized the provinces, leading to several local uprisings such as the [[Batavian rebellion|Batavian revolt]] in [[Gaul]]. [[Batavians|Batavian]] auxiliaries of the [[Rhine]] legions, led by [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], had rebelled with the aid of a faction of [[Treveri]] under the command of [[Julius Classicus]]. Seven legions were sent from Rome, led by Vespasian's brother-in-law [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]].<ref name=jones-16/>\n\nAlthough the revolt was quickly suppressed, exaggerated reports of disaster prompted Mucianus to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own. Domitian eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own. According to Tacitus, Mucianus was not keen on this prospect but since he considered Domitian a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him, he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome.<ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 4#68|IV.68]]</ref>\n\nWhen news arrived of Cerialis' victory over Civilis, Mucianus tactfully dissuaded Domitian from pursuing further military endeavours.<ref name=jones-16/> Domitian then wrote to Cerialis personally, suggesting he hand over command of his army but, once again, he was snubbed.<ref name=jones-16/> With the return of Vespasian in late September, his political role was rendered all but obsolete and Domitian withdrew from government devoting his time to arts and literature.<ref name=jones-17>Jones (1992), p. 17</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n\n[[Image:Domitia.JPG|thumb|A bust of [[Domitia Longina]], with Flavian [[hairstyle]], ([[Louvre]]).]]\nWhere his political and military career had ended in disappointment, Domitian's private affairs were more successful. In 70 Vespasian attempted to arrange a dynastic marriage between his youngest son and the daughter of Titus, [[Julia Flavia]],<ref name=jones-33>Jones (1992), p. 33</ref> but Domitian was adamant in his love for [[Domitia Longina]], going so far as to persuade her husband, Lucius Aelius Lamia, to divorce her so that Domitian could marry her himself.<ref name=jones-33/> Despite its initial recklessness, the alliance was very prestigious for both families. Domitia Longina was the younger daughter of [[Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo]], a respected general and honoured politician who had distinguished himself for his leadership in Armenia. Following the failed [[Pisonian conspiracy]] against Nero in 65, he had been forced to commit suicide. (Domitia Longina was also a granddaughter of [[Junia Lepida]], a descendent of Emperor Augustus) The new marriage not only re-established ties to senatorial opposition, but also served the broader Flavian propaganda of the time, which sought to diminish Vespasian's political success under Nero. Instead connections to Claudius and Britannicus were emphasised, and Nero's victims, or those otherwise disadvantaged by him, rehabilitated.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 34</ref>\n\nIn 80, Domitia and Domitian's only attested son was born. It is not known what the boy's name was, but he died in childhood in 83.<ref name=jones-36>Jones (1993), p. 36</ref> Shortly following his accession as Emperor, Domitian bestowed the honorific title of ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' upon Domitia, while their son was [[apotheosis|deified]], appearing as such on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of coin types from this period.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Nevertheless, the marriage appears to have faced a significant crisis in 83. For reasons unknown, Domitian briefly [[exile]]d Domitia, and then soon recalled her, either out of love or due to rumours that he was carrying on a relationship with his niece Julia Flavia.<ref name=jones-39>Jones (1992), p. 39</ref> Jones argues that most likely he did so for her failure to produce an heir.<ref name=jones-36/> By 84, Domitia had returned to the palace,<ref>Varner (1995), p. 200</ref> where she lived for the remainder of Domitian's reign without incident.<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 34\u201335</ref> Little is known of Domitia's activities as Empress, or how much influence she wielded in Domitian's government, but it seems her role was limited. From Suetonius, we know that she at least accompanied the Emperor to the [[amphitheatre]], while the Jewish writer [[Flavius Josephus|Josephus]] speaks of benefits he received from her.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-37\">Jones (1992), p. 37</ref> It is not known whether Domitian had other children, but he did not marry again.

In June 71, Titus returned triumphant from the war in Judaea.

As the eldest and most experienced of Vespasian's sons, Titus shared [[tribune|tribunician power]] with his father, received seven consulships, the [[Roman censor|censorship]], and was given [[Praetorian prefect|command]] of the Praetorian Guard; powers that left no doubt he was the designated heir to the Empire.<ref name=jones-18>Jones (1992), p. 18</ref> As a second son, Domitian held honorary titles, such as ''Caesar'' or ''[[Princeps]] Iuventutis'', and several priesthoods, including those of ''[[augur]]'', ''[[pontifex]]'', ''[[Arval Brethren|frater arvalis]]'', ''magister frater arvalium'', and ''sacerdos collegiorum omnium'',<ref name=jones-19/> but no office with ''[[imperium]]''.\n\nHe held six consulships during Vespasian's reign but only one of these, in 73, was an ordinary consulship. The other five were less prestigious [[suffect consul]]ships, which he held in 71, 75, 76, 77 and 79 respectively, usually replacing his father or brother in mid-January.<ref name=jones-18/> While ceremonial, these offices no doubt gained Domitian valuable experience in the Roman Senate, and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance.<ref name=jones-19>Jones (1992), p. 19</ref>\n\nUnder Vespasian and Titus, non-Flavians were virtually excluded from the important public offices. Mucianus himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time, and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Crook | first = John A. | title = Titus and Berenice | journal = The American Journal of Philology | volume = 72 | issue = 2 | pages = 162\u2013175 | year = 1951| doi = 10.2307/292544 | jstor=292544}}</ref> Real power was unmistakably concentrated in the hands of the Flavian faction; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of [[democracy]].<ref name=jones-163>Jones (1992), p. 163</ref>\n\nBecause Titus effectively acted as co-emperor with his father, no abrupt change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership in the government would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor ''imperium'' of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.<ref name=\"jones-20\">Jones (1992), p. 20</ref>\n\nTwo major disasters struck during 79 and 80. On 24 August 79, [[79 eruption of Vesuvius|Mount Vesuvius erupted]],<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#22 LXVI.22]</ref> burying the surrounding cities of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] under metres of ash and lava; the following year, a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings.<ref name=jones-80>Jones (1992), p. 80</ref> Consequently, Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property. On 13 September 81, after barely two years in office, he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the [[Sabine]] territories.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nAncient authors have implicated Domitian in the death of his brother, either by directly accusing him of murder,<ref>Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_6_31.html#%A732 6.32]</ref> or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead,<ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-2\"/><ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\">Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/66*.html#26 LXVI.26]</ref> even alleging that during his lifetime, Domitian was openly plotting against his brother.<ref name=\"dio-romanhistory-lxvi-26\"/> It is difficult to assess the factual veracity of these statements given the known [[bias]] of the surviving sources. Brotherly affection was likely at a minimum, but this was hardly surprising, considering that Domitian had barely seen Titus after the age of seven.<ref name=jones-20/>\n\nWhatever the nature of their relationship, Domitian seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying, instead making for the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] where he was proclaimed emperor. The following day, 14 September, the Senate confirmed Domitian's powers, granting tribunician power, the office of [[Pontifex Maximus]], and the titles of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' (\"venerable\"), and ''[[Pater Patriae]]'' (\"father of the country\").<ref name=jones-21>Jones (1992), p. 21</ref>\n\n==Emperor (81\u201396)==\n\n===Rule===\n{{Flavian dynasty\n|image=\n|caption=\n}}\nAs Emperor, Domitian quickly dispensed with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign.<ref name=jones-22>Jones (1992), p. 22</ref> By moving the centre of government (more or less formally) to the imperial [[royal court|court]], Domitian openly rendered the Senate's powers obsolete. In his view, the Roman Empire was to be governed as a [[Divine Right of Kings|divine monarchy]] with himself as the [[Enlightened absolutism|benevolent despot]] at its head.\n\nIn addition to exercising absolute political power, Domitian believed the emperor's role encompassed every aspect of daily life, guiding the Roman people as a cultural and [[moral authority]].<ref name=jones-99>Jones (1992), p. 99</ref> To usher in the new era, he embarked on ambitious economic, military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the splendour it had seen under the Emperor [[Augustus]].<ref name=jones-72>Jones (1992), p. 72</ref>\n\nDespite these grand designs Domitian was determined to govern the Empire conscientiously and scrupulously. He became personally involved in all branches of the administration: [[edict]]s were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law, while taxation and public morals were rigidly enforced.<ref name=jones-107>Jones (1992), p. 107</ref> According to Suetonius, the imperial [[bureaucracy]] never ran more efficiently than under Domitian, whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among [[Roman governor|provincial governors]] and elected officials.<ref name=jones-109>Jones (1992), p. 109</ref>\n\nAlthough he made no pretence regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members, a policy that stood in contrast to the [[nepotism]] practiced by Vespasian and Titus.<ref name=jones-164>Jones (1992), p. 164</ref> Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.<ref name=jones-178>Jones (1992), pp. 178\u2013179</ref>\n\nThe reality of Domitian's autocracy was further highlighted by the fact that, more than any emperor since Tiberius, he spent significant periods of time away from the capital.<ref name=jones-150/> Although the Senate's power had been in decline since the fall of the Republic, under Domitian the seat of power was no longer even in Rome, but rather wherever the Emperor was.<ref name=jones-22/> Until the completion of the [[Flavian Palace]] on the [[Palatine Hill]], the imperial court was situated at Alba or Circeii, and sometimes even farther afield. Domitian toured the European provinces extensively, and spent at least three years of his reign in Germania and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], conducting military campaigns on the frontiers of the Empire.<ref name=jones-26>Jones (1992), pp. 26\u201328</ref>\n\n====Palaces, villas and other major buildings====\n\nFor his personal use he was active in constructing many monumental buildings including the [[Villa of Domitian]], a vast and sumptuous palace situated 20&nbsp;km outside Rome in the Alban Hills.\n\nIn Rome itself he built the [[Palace of Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]].\n\nSix other villas are linked with Domitian at [[Tusculum]], [[Antium]], Caieta, [[Monte Circeo|Circei]], Anxur<ref>Martial VI</ref> and [[Baiae]].<ref>Martial IV 30</ref> Only the one at Circei has been identified today, where its remains can be visited by the Lago di Paola.\n\nThe [[Stadium of Domitian]] was dedicated in 86 AD as a gift to the people of Rome as part of an Imperial building programme following the damage or destruction of most of the buildings on the Field of Mars by fire in 79 AD. It was Rome's first permanent venue for competitive athletics, and today occupied by the [[Piazza Navona]].\n\n===Economy===\n[[Image:Domitian denarius son.png|thumb|250px|Upon his accession, Domitian revalued the Roman currency by increasing the silver content of the [[denarius]] by 12%.

The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-73>Jones (1992), p. 73</ref> Upon his accession he revalued the [[Roman currency]] dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the [[denarius]] from 90% to 98% \u2014 the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87&nbsp;grams to 3.26&nbsp;grams.

Domitian's rigorous taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years.<ref name=jones-75/> Coinage from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to Domitian's titulature and refined artwork on the reverse portraits.<ref name=jones-75/>\n\nJones estimates Domitian's annual income at more than 1.2 billion [[sestertius|sestertii]], of which over one-third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army.<ref name=jones-73/> The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome.

Around fifty structures were erected, restored or completed, achievements second only to those of Augustus.<ref name=jones-79>Jones (1992), p. 79</ref> Among the most important new structures were an [[Odeon of Domitian|odeon]], a [[Stadium of Domitian|stadium]], and an expansive palace on the Palatine Hill known as the Flavian Palace, which was designed by Domitian's master architect [[Rabirius (architect)|Rabirius]].<ref>Jones (1992), pp. 84\u201388</ref>\n\nThe most important building Domitian restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, said to have been covered with a [[gilding|gilded]] roof. Among those completed were the [[Temple of Vespasian and Titus]], the Arch of Titus and the [[Colosseum]], to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area.<ref name=jones-93/>\n\nIn order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million sestertii was spent on donatives, or ''[[congiarium|congiaria]]'', throughout Domitian's reign.<ref name=jones-74>Jones (1992), p. 74</ref> The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets, which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86 he founded the [[Capitoline Games]], a quadrennial contest comprising [[Athletic sport|athletic displays]], [[chariot racing]], and competitions for [[Public speaking|oratory]], music and acting.<ref name=jones-103>Jones (1992), p. 103</ref>\n\nDomitian himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular [[gladiator]]ial games such as naval contests, nighttime battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.<ref name=jones-105>Jones (1992), p. 105</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|250px|A rock inscription near Boyukdash mountain, [[Azerbaijan]], mentioning Domitian and [[Legio XII Fulminata]].

As judged by the carved titles of Caesar, Augustus and Germanicus, the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD.\n\nDomitian's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same fastidious involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government. His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however.<ref name=jones-127>Jones (1992), p. 127</ref> Although he claimed several triumphs, these were largely propaganda manoeuvres. Tacitus derided Domitian's victory against the Chatti as a \"mock triumph\", and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of Agricola.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#39|39]]</ref><ref>Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#2|I.2]]</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Domitian appears to have been very popular among the soldiers, spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns\u2014more than any emperor since Augustus\u2014and raising their pay by one-third.<ref name=jones-131/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 64</ref> While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions, the loyalty of the common soldier was unquestioned.<ref name=jones-144>Jones (1992), p. 144</ref>\n\n====Campaign against the Chatti====\nOnce Emperor, Domitian immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory. As early as 82, or possibly 83, he went to Gaul, ostensibly to conduct a [[census]], and suddenly ordered an attack on the [[Chatti]].<ref name=jones-128>Jones (1992), p. 128</ref> For this purpose, a new legion was founded, Legio I Minervia, which constructed some 75&nbsp;kilometres (46&nbsp;mi) of roads through Chattan territory to uncover the enemy's hiding places.<ref name=jones-130>Jones (1992), p. 130</ref>\n\nAlthough little information survives of the battles fought, enough early victories were apparently achieved for Domitian to be back in Rome by the end of 83, where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of ''Germanicus''.<ref name=jones-129>Jones (1992), p. 129</ref> Domitian's supposed victory was much scorned by ancient authors, who described the campaign as \"uncalled for\",<ref name=suetonius-domitian-6>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#6 6]</ref> and a \"mock triumph\".<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The evidence lends some credence to these claims, as the Chatti would later play a significant role during the revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Conquest of Britain (77\u201384)====\n[[Image:Statue of Agricola at Bath cropped.png|thumb|upright|[[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] ([[Bath, Somerset|Bath]])]]\n{{Main|Roman conquest of Britain}}\nOne of the most detailed reports of military activity under the Flavian dynasty was written by Tacitus, whose biography of his father-in-law Gnaeus Julius Agricola largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84.<ref name=jones-131/> Agricola arrived c. 77 as governor of Roman Britain, immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia (modern Scotland).\n\nIn 82 Agricola crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-1>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#24|24]]</ref> He fortified the coast facing Ireland, and Tacitus recalls that his father-in-law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few [[auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliaries]].<ref name=jones-132>Jones (1992), p. 132</ref> He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest.

To aid the advance, a large legionary fortress was constructed at [[Inchtuthil]].<ref name=jones-132/> In the summer of 84, Agricola faced the armies of the Caledonians, led by [[Calgacus]], at the [[Battle of Mons Graupius]].<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-2>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#29|29]]</ref> Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, two-thirds of the Caledonian army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], ultimately preventing Agricola from bringing the entire British island under his control.<ref name=jones-132/>\n\nIn 85, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian, having served for more than six years as governor, longer than normal for consular legates during the Flavian era.<ref name=jones-132/> Tacitus claims that Domitian ordered his recall because Agricola's successes outshone the Emperor's own modest victories in Germania.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-39/> The relationship between Agricola and the Emperor is unclear: on the one hand, Agricola was awarded triumphal decorations and a statue, on the other, Agricola never again held a civil or military post in spite of his experience and renown. He was offered the governorship of the province of Africa but declined it, either due to ill health or, as Tacitus claims, the machinations of Domitian.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-24-3>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#42|42]]</ref>\n\nNot long after Agricola's recall from Britain, the Roman Empire entered into war with the [[Dacia|Kingdom of Dacia]] in the East. Reinforcements were needed, and in 87 or 88, Domitian ordered a large-scale strategic [[Withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] of troops in the British province. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled and the Caledonian forts and watchtowers abandoned, moving the Roman frontier some 120&nbsp;kilometres (75&nbsp;mi) further south.<ref name=jones-133>Jones (1992), p. 133</ref> The army command may have resented Domitian's decision to retreat, but to him the Caledonian territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury.<ref name=jones-131/>\n\n====Dacian wars (85\u201388)====\n{{details|Domitian's Dacian War}}\n\n[[Image:Roman province of Dacia (106 - 271 AD).svg|thumb|The Roman province of [[Dacia]] (purple area) after the conquest of Trajan in 106, with the [[Black Sea]] to the far right.]]\nThe most significant threat the Roman Empire faced during the reign of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed the most formidable threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King [[Decebalus]], crossed the Danube into the province of [[Moesia]], wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor [[Oppius Sabinus]].<ref name=jones-138>Jones (1992), p. 138</ref>\n\nDomitian quickly launched a [[counterattack|counteroffensive]], personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian prefect [[Cornelius Fuscus]]. Fuscus successfully drove the Dacians back across the border in mid-85, prompting Domitian to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph.<ref name=jones-139>Jones (1992), p. 139</ref>\n\nThe victory proved short-lived, however: as early in 86 Fuscus embarked on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia. Fuscus was killed, and the [[Aquila (Roman)|battle standard]] of the Praetorian Guard was lost.<ref name=jones-138/> The loss of the battle standard, or ''aquila'', was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious affront to Roman national pride.\n\nDomitian returned to Moesia in August 86. He divided the province into Lower Moesia and Upper Moesia, and transferred three additional legions to the Danube. In 87, the Romans invaded Dacia once more, this time under the command of [[Tettius Julianus]], and finally defeated Decebalus in late 88 at the same site where Fuscus had previously perished.<ref name=jones-142>Jones (1992), p. 142</ref> An attack on the Dacian capital [[Sarmizegetusa Regia|Sarmizegetusa]] was forestalled when new troubles arose on the German frontier in 89.<ref name=jones-150>Jones (1992), p. 150</ref>\n\nIn order to avert having to conduct a war on two fronts, Domitian agreed to terms of peace with Decebalus, negotiating free access of Roman troops through the Dacian region while granting Decebalus an annual subsidy of 8 million sesterces.<ref name=jones-150/> Contemporary authors severely criticized this treaty, which was considered shameful to the Romans and left the deaths of Sabinus and Fuscus unavenged.<ref name=jones-195>Jones (1992), p. 195</ref> For the remainder of Domitian's reign Dacia remained a relatively peaceful [[client state|client kingdom]], but Decebalus used the Roman money to fortify his defenses.<ref name=Salmon/>\n\nDomitian probably wanted a new war against the Dacians, and reinforced Upper Moesia with two more cavalry units brought from Syria and with at least five cohorts brought from Pannonia. [[Trajan]] continued Domitian's policy and added two more units to the auxiliary forces of Upper Moesia, and then he used the build up of troops for his Dacian wars.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Knight | first = D.

In order to justify the divine nature of the Flavian rule, Domitian emphasized connections with the chief deity [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]],<ref name=jones-99/> perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. A small [[chapel]] dedicated to ''Jupiter Conservator'' was also constructed near the house where Domitian had fled to safety on 20 December 69. Later in his reign, he replaced it with a more expansive building, dedicated to ''Jupiter Custos''.<ref name=jones-88>Jones (1992), p. 88</ref>\n\nThe goddess he worshipped the most zealously, however, was [[Minerva]]. Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage\u2014in four different attested reverse types\u2014and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.<ref name=jones-100>Jones (1992), p. 100</ref>\n\nDomitian also revived the practice of the [[imperial cult (ancient Rome)|imperial cult]], which had fallen somewhat out of use under Vespasian. Significantly, his first act as an Emperor was the deification of his brother Titus. Upon their deaths, his infant son, and niece, Julia Flavia, were likewise enrolled among the gods. With regards to the emperor himself as a religious figure, both Suetonius and [[Cassius Dio]] allege that Domitian officially gave himself the title of ''Dominus et Deus'' (\"Lord and God\").<ref>Suetonius, ''Domitian'', 13:2</ref><ref>Dio, ''Roman History'', 67:4:7</ref> However, not only did he reject the title of ''Dominus'' during his reign,<ref name=jones-108>Jones (1992), p. 108</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Light From the Ancient East|last=contra Deissmann|first=Adolf|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|year=1995|isbn=978-1-56563-155-7|location=Peabody, Massachusetts|pages=357, n. 1|via=}}</ref> but since he issued no official documentation or coinage to this effect, historians such as Brian Jones contend that such phrases were addressed to Domitian by flatterers who wished to earn favors from the emperor.<ref name=jones-109/>\n\nTo foster the worship of the imperial family, he erected a dynastic [[mausoleum]] on the site of Vespasian's former house on the [[Quirinal Hill|Quirinal]],<ref name=jones-87>Jones (1992), p. 87</ref> and completed the Temple of Vespasian and Titus, a shrine dedicated to the worship of his deified father and brother.<ref name=jones-93/> To memorialize the military triumphs of the Flavian family, he ordered the construction of the Templum Divorum and the Templum Fortuna Redux, and completed the Arch of Titus.\n\nConstruction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of Domitian's religious policy, which also concerned itself with the fulfilment of religious law and public morals. In 85, he nominated himself perpetual censor, the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct.<ref name=jones-106>Jones (1992), p. 106</ref> Once again, Domitian acquitted himself of this task dutifully, and with care. He renewed the ''[[Lex Julia|Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis]]'', under which adultery was punishable by exile. From the list of jurors he struck an equestrian who had divorced his wife and taken her back, while an ex-quaestor was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing.<ref name=jones-107/>\n\nDomitian also heavily prosecuted corruption among public officials, removing jurors if they accepted bribes and rescinding legislation when a [[conflict of interest]] was suspected.<ref name=jones-107/> He ensured that [[libel]]lous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death.<ref name=jones-107/> Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for [[satire]] at the expense of the government.<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 54</ref> Consequently, he forbade [[mime]]s from appearing on stage in public.\n\nIn 87, [[Vestal Virgin]]s were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity. As the Vestals were regarded as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted [[incest]]. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be [[Premature burial|buried alive]].<ref name=jones-101>Jones (1992), p. 101</ref>\n\nForeign religions were tolerated insofar as they did not interfere with public order, or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion. The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the Flavian dynasty, to an extent not seen again until the reign of [[Commodus]]. Veneration of [[Serapis]] and Isis, who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively, was especially prominent.<ref name=jones-100/>\n\n4th century writings by [[Eusebius]] maintain that Jews and [[Christianity|Christians]] were heavily [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire#Under Domitian|persecuted]] toward the end of Domitian's reign.<ref>{{cite book | last = Eusebius of Caessarea | authorlink = Eusebius of Caesarea | title = Church History | year = 425 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Smallwood | first = E.M. | title = 'Domitian's attitude towards the Jews and Judaism | journal = Classical Philology | volume = 51 | pages = 1\u201313 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1086/363978 }}</ref> The [[Book of Revelation]] is thought by some to have been written during this period.<ref>{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Raymond E. | authorlink = Raymond E.

The Senatorial officers may have disapproved of Domitian's military strategies, such as his decision to fortify the German frontier rather than attack, as well as his recent retreat from Britain, and finally the disgraceful policy of [[appeasement]] towards Decebalus.<ref name=jones-145>Jones (1992), p. 145</ref>\n\nAt any rate, the uprising was strictly confined to Saturninus' province, and quickly detected once the rumour spread across the neighbouring provinces. The [[Roman governors of Germania Inferior|governor of Germania Inferior]], [[Aulus Bucius Lappius Maximus]], moved to the region at once, assisted by the procurator of [[Rhaetia]], [[Titus Flavius Norbanus]]. From Spain, Trajan was summoned, while Domitian himself came from Rome with the Praetorian Guard.<ref name=jones-146>Jones (1992), p. 146</ref>\n\nBy a stroke of luck, a thaw prevented the Chatti from crossing the Rhine and coming to Saturninus' aid.<ref name=jones-146/> Within twenty-four days the rebellion was crushed, and its leaders at Mainz savagely punished. The mutinous legions were sent to the front in Illyricum, while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded.<ref name=jones-149>Jones (1992), p. 149</ref>\n\nLappius Maximus received the governorship of the province of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with [[Titus Petronius Secundus]] as his colleague.<ref name=jones-148>Jones (1992), pp. 148\u2013149</ref> Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion similar to the one he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\">Grainger (2003), p. 30</ref>\n\nAlthough little is known about the life and career of Nerva before his accession as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.<ref name=\"Grainger 2003, p. 30\"/> His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime.<ref>Murison (2003), p. 150</ref> The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.\n\n====Relationship with the Senate====\n[[File:Domitian Vaison-la-Romaine.jpg|thumb|Domitian in military garb, wearing the [[muscle cuirass]] with [[Roman sculpture|decorative reliefs]], from [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], France]]\nSince the fall of the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the [[Principate]].

Domitian was not so subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his [[autocracy]].<ref name=jones-161/> He disliked [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every decision-making power from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.<ref name=jones-169>Jones (1992), p. 169</ref>\n\nThe dislike was mutual. After Domitian's assassination, the senators of Rome rushed to the Senate house, where they immediately passed a motion [[Damnatio memoriae|condemning his memory]] to oblivion.<ref name=jones-160>Jones (1992), p. 160</ref> Under the rulers of the Nervan-Antonian dynasty, senatorial authors published histories that elaborated on the view of Domitian as a tyrant.<ref name=jones-161/>\n\nNevertheless, the evidence suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely in the hands of the Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul.<ref name=jones-163-8>Jones (1992), pp. 163\u2013168</ref> Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were almost invariably brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.<ref name=jones-169/>\n\nBoth Tacitus and Suetonius speak of escalating persecutions toward the end of Domitian's reign, identifying a point of sharp increase around 93, or sometime after the failed revolt of Saturninus in 89.<ref name=tacitus-agricola-45>Tacitus, ''Agricola'' [[s:Agricola#45|45]]</ref><ref name=suetonius-domitian-10>Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#10 10]</ref> At least twenty senatorial opponents were executed,<ref>For a full list of senatorial victims, see Jones (1992), pp. 182\u2013188</ref> including Domitia Longina's former husband Lucius Aelius Lamia and three of Domitian's own family members, [[Titus Flavius Sabinus (consul AD 82)|Titus Flavius Sabinus]], [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] and Marcus Arrecinus Clemens.<ref>M.

As a result, he was always restless around that time. On the day of the assassination, Domitian was distressed and repeatedly asked a servant to tell him what time it was. The servant, who was himself one of the plotters, lied to the emperor, telling him that it was already late in the afternoon.<ref name=grainger-1-3/> Apparently put at ease, the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees.

To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive.<ref name=jones-194/>\n\nOn the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | title = Domitian: The Last Years | journal = Chiron | volume = 13 | pages = 121\u2013146 | year = 1983 }}</ref> but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.<ref name=\"murison-153\"/> The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy.<ref name=\"jones-domitian-196\">Jones (1992), p. 196</ref>\n\nThe Senate nonetheless rejoiced at the death of Domitian, and immediately following Nerva's accession as Emperor, passed ''damnatio memoriae'' on his memory: his coins and statues were melted, his arches were torn down and his name was erased from all public records.<ref name=grainger-49>Grainger (2003), p. 49</ref> Domitian and, over a century later, [[Publius Septimius Geta]] were the only emperors known to have officially received a ''damnatio memoriae'', though others may have received ''de facto'' ones. In many instances, existing portraits of Domitian, such as those found on the [[Cancelleria Reliefs]], were simply recarved to fit the likeness of Nerva, which allowed quick production of new images and recycling of previous material.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Last | first = Hugh | title = On the Flavian Reliefs from the Palazzo della Cancelleria | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 38 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 9\u201314 | year = 1948 | jstor = 298163| doi = 10.2307/298163 }}</ref> Yet the order of the Senate was only partially executed in Rome, and wholly disregarded in most of the provinces outside Italy.<ref name=grainger-49/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the people of Rome met the news of Domitian's death with indifference, but the army was much grieved, calling for his deification immediately after the assassination, and in several provinces rioting.<ref>Grainger (2003), pp. 32\u201333</ref> As a compensation measure, the Praetorian Guard demanded the execution of Domitian's assassins, which Nerva refused. Instead he merely dismissed Titus Petronius Secundus, and replaced him with a former commander, [[Casperius Aelianus]].<ref>Grainger (2003), p. 40</ref>\n\nDissatisfaction with this state of affairs continued to loom over Nerva's reign, and ultimately erupted into a crisis in October 97, when members of the Praetorian Guard, led by Casperius Aelianus, laid [[siege]] to the Imperial Palace and took Nerva hostage.<ref name=grainger-94>Grainger (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was forced to submit to their demands, agreeing to hand over those responsible for Domitian's death and even giving a speech thanking the rebellious Praetorians.<ref name=grainger-94/> Titus Petronius Secundus and Parthenius were sought out and killed. Nerva was unharmed in this assault, but his authority was damaged beyond repair. Shortly thereafter he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor, and with this decision all but [[abdication|abdicated]].<ref>{{cite journal | last = Syme | first = Ronald | authorlink = Ronald Syme | title = Guard Prefects of Trajan and Hadrian | journal = The Journal of Roman Studies | volume = 70 | year = 1980| doi = 10.2307/299556 | jstor=299556 | pages = 64\u201380}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Ancient sources===\n[[Image:Domitian statue Vatican.png|thumb|Domitian as Emperor ([[Vatican Museums]]), possibly recut from a statue of Nero.]]\nThe classic view of Domitian is usually negative, since most of the antique sources were related to the Senatorial or aristocratic class, with which Domitian had notoriously difficult relations.<ref name=jones-160/> Furthermore, contemporary historians such as [[Pliny the Younger]], Tacitus and Suetonius all wrote down the information on his reign after it had ended, and his memory had been condemned to oblivion. The work of Domitian's court poets [[Martial]] and [[Statius]] constitutes virtually the only literary evidence concurrent with his reign. Perhaps as unsurprising as the attitude of post-Domitianic historians, the poems of Martial and Statius are highly adulatory, praising Domitian's achievements as equalling those of the gods.<ref>Jones (1992), p. 32</ref>\n\nThe most extensive account of the life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor [[Hadrian]] (117\u2013138). His ''[[De Vita Caesarum]]'' is the source of much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror.<ref>Waters (1964), p. 51</ref> The biography is problematic, however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent [[libertine]].<ref name=jones-198/>\n\nAccording to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his interest in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of [[epigram]]matic expression, suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down.<ref name=jones-198/>\n\n''De Vita Caesarum'' is also the source of several outrageous stories regarding Domitian's marriage life. According to Suetonius, Domitia Longina was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named [[Paris (actor under Domitian)|Paris]]. When Domitian found out, he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife, with Suetonius further adding that once Domitia was exiled, Domitian took Julia as his mistress, who later died during a failed [[abortion]].<ref name=jones-35/><ref name=\"suetonius-domitian-22\">Suetonius, Life of Domitian [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Domitian*.html#22 22]</ref>\n\nModern historians consider this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.<ref>Levick (2002), p. 211</ref> Nevertheless, the account of Suetonius has dominated imperial historiography for centuries.\n\nAlthough Tacitus is usually considered to be the most reliable author of this era, his views on Domitian are complicated by the fact that his father-in-law, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, may have been a personal enemy of the Emperor.<ref name=jones-58>Jones (1992), p. 58</ref> In his biographical work ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'', Tacitus maintains that Agricola was forced into retirement because his triumph over the Caledonians highlighted Domitian's own inadequacy as a military commander. Several modern authors such as Dorey have argued the opposite: that Agricola was in fact a close friend of Domitian, and that Tacitus merely sought to distance his family from the fallen dynasty once Nerva was in power.<ref name=jones-58/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Dorey | first = T.

Unfortunately, the part of Tacitus' ''Histories'' dealing with the reign of the Flavian dynasty is almost entirely lost. His views on Domitian survive through brief comments in its first five books, and the short but highly negative characterization in ''Agricola'' in which he severely criticizes Domitian's military endeavours. Nevertheless, Tacitus admits his debt to the Flavians with regard to his own public career.<ref name=\"tacitus-histories-i-1\">Tacitus, ''Histories'' [[s:The Histories (Tacitus)/Book 1#1|I.1]]</ref>\n\nOther influential 2nd century authors include [[Juvenal]] and Pliny the Younger, the latter of whom was a friend of Tacitus and in 100 delivered his famous ''Panegyricus Traiani'' before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his ''[[Satires of Juvenal|Satires]]'', depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established by the end of the 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the [[Acts of John]].\n\n===Modern revisionism===\n[[File:Domiziano da latina, 81-96 dc..JPG|thumb|Bust of Domitian wearing the [[civic crown]], from the [[Palazzo Massimo alle Terme]], Rome]]\nOver the course of the 20th century, Domitian's military, administrative and economic policies were re-evaluated.  Hostile views of Domitian had been propagated until [[archeology|archeological]] and [[numismatics|numismatic]] advances brought renewed attention to his reign, and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by Tacitus and Pliny. It would be nearly a hundred years after [[St\u00e9phane Gsell]]'s 1894 ''Essai sur le r\u00e8gne de l'empereur Domitien'' however, before any new, book-length studies were published.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>\n\nThe first of these was Jones' 1992 ''The Emperor Domitian''.  He concludes that Domitian was a ruthless but efficient autocrat.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review>{{cite journal | last = Gowing | first = Alain M. | title = Review: The Emperor Domitian | journal = Bryn Mawr Classical Review | year = 1992 | url = http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/1992/03.06.10.html }}</ref> For the majority of his reign, there was no widespread dissatisfaction with his policies. His harshness was limited to a highly vocal minority, who exaggerated his despotism in favor of the [[Nervan-Antonian dynasty]] that followed.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/>  His foreign policy was realistic, rejecting expansionist warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest. Persecution of religious minorities, such as Jews and Christians, was non-existent.<ref name=jones-114-119>Jones (1992), pp. 114\u2013119</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Ronald Syme]] argued for a complete reassessment of Domitian's financial policy, which had been largely viewed as a disaster.<ref>His article begins with \"The work of the spade and the use of common sense have done much to mitigate the influence of Tacitus and Pliny and redeem the memory of Domitian from infamy or oblivion. But much remains to be done.\" ''Imperial Finances'' p. 55</ref>  His economic program, which was rigorously efficient, maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve.\n\nDomitian's government nonetheless exhibited [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] characteristics. As Emperor, he saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of Flavian renaissance.<ref name=jones-72/>  Using religious, military and cultural propaganda, he fostered a [[cult of personality]]. He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the Flavian achievements. Elaborate triumphs were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior-emperor, but many of these were either unearned or premature.<ref name=jones-127/> By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals.<ref name=jones-106/>\n\nHe became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully prosecuted corruption among public officials. The dark side of his censorial power involved a restriction in freedom of speech, and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate. He punished libel with exile or death and, due to his suspicious nature, increasingly accepted information from [[delatores|informers]] to bring false charges of treason if necessary.<ref name=jones-180>Jones (1992), p. 180</ref>\n\nDespite his vilification by contemporary historians, Domitian's administration provided the foundation for the Principate of the peaceful 2nd century. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from his. Much more than a \"gloomy coda to the...1st century\", the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign that [[Theodor Mommsen]] described as a somber but intelligent despotism.<ref name=gowing-domitian-review/><ref>Syme (1930), p. 67</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cultural depictions of Domitian]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book | last = Grainger | first = John D. | title = Nerva and the Roman Succession Crisis of AD 96\u201399 | location = London | publisher = Routledge | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-28917-7 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Jones | first = Brian W. | title = The Emperor Domitian | publisher = Routledge | year = 1992 | location = London | isbn = 978-0-415-10195-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LxeIAgAAQBAJ}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Levick | first = Barbara | authorlink = Barbara Levick | title = Corbulo's Daughter | journal = Greece & Rome | volume = 49 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 199\u2013211 | doi = 10.1093/gr/49.2.199 | jstor=826906}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Morgan | first = Llewelyn | title = Achilleae Comae: Hair and Heroism According to Domitian |journal=The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series |volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 209\u2013214 | year = 1997 | doi = 10.1093/cq/47.1.209 | jstor=639608}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Murison | first = Charles Leslie | title = M.
